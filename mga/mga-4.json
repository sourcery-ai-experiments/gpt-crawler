As an FIAU agent, the MGA extends its assistance and cooperation to the FIAU in fulfilment of its responsibilities. More specifically, the MGA is responsible for monitoring compliance of casino and gaming licensees with the PMLA, the PMLFTR and any Implementing Procedures or guidance issued thereunder, and for reporting non-compliance with the same to the FIAU.\n\nAML/CFT Obligations – A brief outline\n\nThe anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) obligations require casino and gaming licensees, more specifically B2C licensees offering Type 1, 2 and 3 games, to apply a risk-based approach in applying AML/CFT measures, controls, and procedures.\n\nBy adopting a risk-based approach, licensees can ensure that actions to prevent or mitigate are ML/TF proportionate to the risks identified. The principle is that resources must be allocated on a priority basis so that the most significant risks are given the most attention. To ensure a risk-based approach, licensees must perform a business risk assessment to understand the risks and vulnerabilities to which they may be exposed. Following this, the licensee has to devise a Customer Acceptance Policy and transcribe its AML/CFT policies and procedures outlining how the company will be abiding with its Customer Due Diligence and other various AML/CFT obligations.\n\nFurther information can be provided in the System Audit Checklist.\n\nLicensees are also primarily required to appoint a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) of sufficient seniority and command whose main responsibility is to analyse unusual or suspicious activity or transactions observed within the business activity, and to follow up the same as necessary through the filing of a suspicious transaction report (STR) with the FIAU. In addition, the appointed MLRO has to be registered with the FIAU and an approved Key AML Function by the MGA.\n\nResources\n\nThe Implementing Procedures issued by the FIAU as per its powers under Regulation 17 of the PMLFTR are likewise legally binding instruments. The Implementing Procedures are divided in two parts; Part I is applicable to all sectors and Part II applies to each sector specifically.\n\n \n\nFIAU Implementing Procedures Part I\n\nFIAU Implementing Procedures Part II – Remote Gaming Sector\n\nFIAU Implementing Procedures Part II –Land Based Casino\n\n \n\n \n\nOutreach and Guidance for Operators\n\nIn order to stay abreast with the most recent updates, make sure to subscribe to both the MGA newsletter, and the FIAU newsletter.\n\nBoth the MGA as well as the FIAU hold a number of outreach events, including:\n\nThe Revised Implementing Procedure of the Remote Gaming Sector – What are the Major Changes?\n\nAML/CFT in the Remote Gaming Sector – Trends, Typologies & Common Findings\n\nThe MLRO in the Gaming Sector\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nFIAU Guidance documents repository\n\nResults of the ML/TF Maltese NRA – 2018\n\nEuropean Commission Supranational risk assessment of ML/TF – 2022\n\nMoneyval report on the use of remote gambling for ML/FT\n\nFATF publications\n\n \n\n \n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The Guidance Note had been published before the finalisation and publication of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, with the aim of informing Authorised Persons about the potential impacts of Brexit and to provide guidance during a period of uncertainty. Therefore, the Guidance Note is reflective of the Authority’s position preceding the publication and coming into force of the Agreement.\n\nThe publication of the Agreement was pivotal in providing legal clarity as to how the EU-UK relationship will continue post-Brexit and delineated the terms that either Party is bound by in the development of trade and investment between them. The Authority is obliged to adhere to the Agreement’s terms, which supersede any positions held before it entered into force.\n\nIn light of this, the Authority is hereby repealing the Guidance Note, as part of its sustained commitment to ensure its legal and regulatory framework is clear, accurate and up-to-date. Furthermore, through the Notice of Repeal, the Authority has also taken the opportunity to provide additional clarity on the matters outlined within the Guidance Note.\n\nThe repealed Guidance Note may be accessed here.  \n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Nevertheless, compared to others, these sectors are susceptible to a higher risk of money laundering.\nSome of the higher risks identified include laundering proceeds from drug trafficking, foreign organised crime, and fraud (including cybercrime).\nMoney laundering typologies presenting a higher level of residual risk include the abuse of cash and cash-based businesses, the use of Maltese registered companies lacking sufficient links to Malta, complex corporate structures, and the acquisition of high-value movable and immovable property.\nResidual risks associated with terrorism financing, proliferation financing, and targeted financial sanctions were found to be moderate.\n\nAll subject persons are obliged to consider the risks identified in this latest version of the NRA as part of their risk assessment process, reviewing and updating their controls, policies and procedures as necessary to reflect and mitigate the identified risks.\n\nThe 2023 NRA is available for download here.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

This event presents a unique platform for regulators to come together, exchange knowledge, and collectively address the evolving challenges within our industry.\n\n“We look forward to welcoming esteemed regulators from across Europe to Malta, as we strive to further strengthen collaboration and drive regulatory excellence.”\n\nEstablished in 1989, GREF facilitates constructive dialogue among regulators, representing diverse perspectives, while also acting as a central point of contact for authorities and related organisations seeking insights from European gaming regulators.\n\nBack in 2016, the MGA had organised a successful joint conference for GREF and the International Association of Gaming Advisors (IAGA).

As a part of our ongoing efforts to champion sustainability, we are proud to announce a unique initiative, whereby one tree is planted for every new employee who joins the Authority.\n\nKicking off this project, the MGA recently planted 17 trees, a mixture of the indigenous Tamarisk and Chaste trees, at the Marsaskala Nature Trust Reserve. This area is currently undergoing several conservation projects, and we hope that our initiative contributes to this mission.\n\n17 MGA employees, who joined the Authority over the year 2023, got their hands dirty planting the saplings and learnt more about conservation, what needs to be done when planting a tree, and the after-care that Nature Trust will carry out to ensure that  these trees continue to grow.\n\nChristopher Formosa, Deputy CEO and COO, said: “This initiative aligns perfectly with the MGA’s dedication to fostering a more sustainable future. By planting a tree in the name of our new joiners, we aim not only to signify the beginning of their journey with us, but also to symbolise the professional growth and development we anticipate for both them and our organisation”.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

It also provides all the necessary information needed by Data Subjects to be able to request further information on issues relating to data protection and privacy as may be required.\n\nPersonal Information We Process\n\nThe Authority (“MGA” or “We”, “Us”, “Our”) may collect your personal information in accordance with the terms of this privacy notice. Personal information consists of personal data and, in some cases, may also consist of special categories of personal data. The term ‘personal data’ refers to personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, e-mail or mailing address, CV, or any other supporting documentation you may as a user of the website, or as job-candidate for instance, choose to submit to the Authority.\n\nCertain information may be classified as ‘special category personal data’, such as information about you that may reveal your race, ethnic origin, or political opinion. Should we require your special category personal data, we will request your explicit consent.\n\nThe Authority also collects your personal information when you make use of the following facilities which are provided by the Authority which require, to varying degrees, the voluntary submission of your personal information:\n\nthe services available on the Authority website, namely:\nsubscription to the Authority’s Newsletter and News Alerts; and,\nthe Online Gaming Support and Land-based Gaming Support facilities;\nthe Licensee Relationship Management (LRM) Portal; and,\nthe Recruitment Management System.\n\nWebsite usage information is collected using cookies. For more information on the Authority’s use of cookies, kindly refer to section entitled Cookies, Tags and Other Identifiers (“Cookies”) of this notice.\n\nHow is Personal Information Gathered Used?\n\nWhile fulfilling its role as the regulatory body responsible for the governance and supervision of all gaming activities in and from Malta, the MGA processes certain personal data relating to licensees, players, employees, and the general public, including candidates using the Recruitment Management System.\n\nThe Authority may collect and process your personal information for the following purposes:\n\nto provide its services;\nto carry out its regulatory, licensing and enforcement functions;\nto meet its legal responsibilities as a Regulator and employer; and,\ngenerally, for regulatory and legal reasons.\n\nCollection of Data from the Recruitment Management System\n\nAs part of its recruitment processes, the MGA also collects and processes personal data relating to job applicants. The Authority is committed to being transparent about how it collects and uses that data and to meeting its data protection obligations.\n\nThe MGA collects a wide range of information including:\n\nyour name, address and contact details, including email address and telephone number;\ndetails of your qualifications, skills, experience and employment history;\ninformation about your current level of remuneration, including benefit entitlements;\nwhether or not you have a impairment for which the Authority needs to make reasonable adjustments during the recruitment process; and\ninformation about your entitlement to work in Malta.\n\nThe MGA may collect this information in a variety of ways. Data might be contained in documents which are submitted to the Authority via the ‘Recruitment Management System’, in the form of CVs or resumes, identification documents such as passports or through other means such as interviews or any other form of assessment. The MGA may also collect personal data such as references from third parties such as your former employers. We will seek information from third parties only when the Authority is providing you with a job offer. You will be informed by the Authority that it will be doing so.\n\nData may be stored in a range of different places, including on your candidate profile as created by yourself, in HR management systems and on other IT systems (including email).\n\nData relating to the Recruitment Management System\n\nIf you are accessing this website as a candidate seeking employment, you shall be required to fill out details, including data referred to above, in the ‘create your profile’ section which can be found on the Recruitment Management System which is accessible through the ‘About Us’ tab. Further details related to this system can be found down below. Such details and information provided may be deemed confidential.\n\nThe Authority’s scope in this regard is to provide you with the most appropriate and suitable employment opportunities matching your interests and qualifications. This will also save your time since you will not be required to go through information about jobs and services which are not relevant to your skillset. To this end, we will also use the data internally for research purposes to enhance user experience.\n\nCandidates shall take full responsibility for the integrity and the accuracy of the data provided.\n\nShould you decline to provide us with any such data we will not be able to provide you with our Service.\n\nCreation of a Candidate Profile on the Recruitment Management System\n\nAny data which are inputted by yourself as a candidate when creating your candidate profile, are stored by the MGA. Since you are the one who will be creating your profile, you will need to read and accept this Privacy Policy. No CVs are accepted or received by ordinary mail or email. Should the MGA receive any CVs through such means, such candidates shall be redirected to where the creation of a candidate-profile can be made. CVs sent outside of the Recruitment Management System shall be deleted or destroyed.\n\nWhen you successfully create your profile, you will gain and retain full access to the data inputted in the profile and you will also have the facility to change, delete, amend or modify such data independently. You shall have full responsibility for the accuracy of the data that you have entered when creating your profile.\n\nThe MGA may send you an automated email to alert you about any changes to the profile you could have made, including for example the removal of a CV or any other information which is considered integral to your job search.\n\nOnce your profile is fully active, you may be contacted about your profile. We may or may not enable or disable job alerts based on your preferences. When you are approached by us about a specific vacancy, we would require your consent to be able to proceed.\n\nShould your profile not show any activity for twelve (12) months, you will receive an automated email asking you to activate your profile to ensure that this will not be deleted by us. Should you not activate your profile for a continuous period of six months following this notification, your profile and all data which would have been stored by us will be deleted.\n\nIf your application for employment is a successful one, personal data gathered during the recruitment process will be transferred to your Human Resources file (electronic and/or paper-based) and retained during your employment. Your data will then be held in terms of our data retention periods and data protection policy that will be made available to you.\n\nWhy does the MGA process personal data?\n\nThe MGA may need to process your data to be able to enter into a contract with you.\n\nIn some cases, we need to process data to ensure that we are complying with our legal obligations. For example, it is mandatory to check a successful applicant’s eligibility to work in Malta before employment starts.\n\nThe MGA has a legitimate interest in processing personal data during the recruitment process and for keeping records of the process. Processing data from job applicants allows us to manage the recruitment process, assess and confirm a candidate’s suitability for employment and ultimately decide who shall be offered the job. We may also need to process data from job applicants to respond to and defend against legal claims.\n\nThe MGA may, for the purposes of ensuring that it is an equal opportunities employer, collect information about whether or not applicants have a disability to be able to make reasonable adjustments for such candidates. We process such information to carry out our legal obligations and to exercise specific rights in relation to employment.\n\nFollowing the activation of your profile and after the commencement and finalisation of the recruiting process, and where your application for employment with the Authority is unsuccessful, the MGA will hold your personal data on file for a further twelve (12) months in case there are future employment opportunities for which you may be suited. We will ask for your consent before keeping your data for this purpose when you submit your documentation on the recruitment system and you will remain free to withdraw your consent at any time. You may also seek to have your information rectified at any time. At the end of that period, or once you withdraw your consent, your data is deleted or destroyed.\n\nWho has access to data?\n\nYour information may be shared internally strictly for the recruitment exercise. This includes members of the HR and recruitment team, interviewers involved in the recruitment process, managers in the business area of the relative vacancy and IT staff if they require access to the data for the performance of their roles.\n\nWe may share your data with the employers you identified in your documentation in order to obtain references about you. We may also share your data with employment background check-providers in order to obtain the necessary background checks.\n\nWe process this data on the basis of a contractual relationship between you and the Authority which is deemed to have become effective once you confirm that you have read and agreed to this Privacy Notice. By entering into this agreement, you are confirming that your former employers referred to within the documentation, you submitted through the recruitment process, as well as any employment background check providers, may forward any information concerning yourself to the Authority.\n\nSharing Personal Data\n\nAll profiles created by you on the Recruitment Management System are created on a system called Talexio which is a third-party platform. This platform is wholly owned by Preeo Studios Limited, used by the MGA and hosted on Amazon Web Services. The data provided to create a profile shall be kept on this third-party platform. The MGA shall treat all CVs, profiles and documentation related thereto in strict confidence provided that per the aforesaid, it may refer to a candidate’s former employer or employers and background check service providers.\n\nHow does the MGA protect data?\n\nWe take the security of your data seriously. We have internal policies and controls in place to ensure that your data is not lost, accidentally destroyed, misused or disclosed, and is not accessed except by our employees in the proper performance of their duties.\n\nWhat if you do not provide personal data?\n\nYou are under no statutory or contractual obligation to provide data to the MGA during the recruitment process. However, if you do not provide such information, we may not be able to process your application properly or at all.\n\nLegal Protection\n\nThe Authority is required to adhere to the Data Protection Act (Cap. 586 of the Laws of Malta) (the “Data Protection Act”) and other relevant regulations, legal notices and similar instruments that may be in force, taking account of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and the Electronic Communications Privacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC) (the “Directives”) (the “Data Protection Laws”).\n\nAll this is in place in order to assure you that at all times your personal information is:\n\nprocessed in accordance with your rights\nprocessed fairly and lawfully\nobtained only for a specific and lawful purpose\nadequate, relevant and not excessive to its purpose\naccurate and updated\nkept in a secure manner\nnot kept longer than is necessary for its purpose\nnot transferred to jurisdictions which do not adhere to the aforementioned Directives.\n\nAny person about whom we hold information has rights under the Data Protection Laws.

The email shall contain your full name, address, and a description of the information you wish to view, correct or delete.\n\nThe Authority’s DPO may request further information from the data subject making the request should any clarifications be required. Furthermore, to ensure confidentiality and to verify the identity of the person making the data subject request, the DPO may request a photo to be taken of the subject person holding a photo identification document clearly showing name, identification number and facial photo on document.\n\nIt is important to note that the rights of data subjects are tied with certain conditions and limitations that are stipulated within the GDPR itself.\n\nThe Authority reserves the right to charge a reasonable fee for repetitive requests, requests for further copies of the same data, and, or requests which are deemed to be manifestly unfounded or excessive. We may also refuse to act upon requests that are deemed to be manifestly unfounded or excessive.\n\nCookies, tags and other identifiers (“Cookies”)\n\nCookies are text files placed on your computer or mobile device to collect standard internet log information and visitor behaviour information.

In the event that a B2C licensee concludes that they fall within the scope of the AUPs, and are however unable to locate the draft record on their LRMS timeline, then they are kindly requested to notify the MGA by sending an email to [email protected].\n\nCan the practitioner access the MGA’s online portal to check whether its client is obliged to prepare these AUPs? \n\nThe compliance obligation to submit the AUPs rests with the licence holder. To the extent that the practitioner is submitting on the licensee’s behalf, they could request access. In this regard, the practitioner would have access to the MGA’s LRMS/online portal only in the event that such access has been granted by the licensee’s Power User through the LRMS itself.\n\nWhich auditors are permitted to prepare the AUPs? \n\nAuditors in possession of a certificate to practise in the field of auditing under the Accountancy Profession Act (Chapter 281 of the Laws of Malta) and/or system and compliance auditors approved by the MGA.\n\nHow shall the AUPs be submitted to the MGA and who shall be submitting them? \n\nThe AUPs shall be submitted to the MGA by the licensee through the MGA’s LRMS which can be accessed through https://portal.mga.org.mt. The AUPs shall be uploaded through the draft record entitled ‘Auditor Player Funds & Gaming Revenue’ which shall be visible on the licensee’s respective timeline as at its financial year end date.\n\nWhat is the deadline for submission of the AUPs to the MGA? \n\nThe AUPs are to be submitted annually to the MGA not later than 9 months from the end of the licensee’s financial year. This shall apply for the year ending December 2022 as well as for any subsequent years.\n\nIf a B2C licence holder has been suspended voluntarily at some point during the year, would the respective licensee be exempted from preparing the AUPs? \n\nA B2C licence holder which would have had its licence suspended voluntarily for some time during the year is still obliged to prepare the AUPs.\n\nIf a B2C licence holder has not gone live yet, would the preparation of the AUPs still be required? \n\nYes, in such case, it wouldstill be required. The MGA is already allowing an exemption from the requirement to prepare the AUPs for the first financial year during which a licence is granted, hence, no further exemptions shall be permitted from the second financial year onwards, should a licensee still remain non-operational until that time.\n\nWould a B2C licence holder be required to prepare the AUPs for the first year of being granted a licence? \n\nNo. If for example, a B2C licence holder would have obtained its licence in April 2021, it shall not be required to prepare the AuPs for financial year 2021. Notwithstanding this exemption, preparation of the AUPs shall still be required for subsequent years.\n\nGiven that B2B licence holders fall outside the scope of the AUPs, would this also apply in terms of Article 41(2)(b)(ii) and (iii) of the Gaming Authorisations and Compliance Directive? \n\nAll B2B licence holders are exempted from reporting the AUPs in terms of Article 41(2)(b)(ii) and (iii) of the Gaming Authorisations and Compliance Directive.\n\nAre B2B licence holders offering shared pooled jackpots obliged to prepare the AUPs? \n\nAll B2B licensees, whether or not they are offering a shared pooled jackpot, fall out of scope and are thus not required to prepare the AUPs.\n\nIn the case of a corporate group licence, would it be correct to say that the scope of testing carried out for both gaming tax and player funds reporting would be solely restricted to the main licence holder? \n\nCorrect. For the financial year 2021 only the main licence holder of a corporate group licence shall be obliged to prepare the AUPs. This shall however be reassessed by the MGA for future financial years and any changes to this policy shall be communicated to the industry.\n\nWhich licensees are required to submit the AUPs? \n\nThe requirement to submit the AUPs applies to all companies licensed by the MGA, except for:\n• B2B licensees;\n• Companies which were granted a licence during the period covered by the Audited Financial Statements for the financial year ending during 2021 (such companies shall then be required to submit the respective declarations for the financial years ending during 2022 onwards);\n• Companies covered by a Corporate Group Licence, other than the main licensee which shall still be required to submit the declarations.\n\nCommercial Communication Games\nWhat is a Commercial Communication Game? \n\nA Commercial Communication Game is a game organised with the purpose to promote or encourage the sale of goods or services.\n\n\nAny person interested in organising a lottery to promote a good or service will need to apply for the relevant permit in order to offer the lottery.\n\nHow do I apply for a Commercial Communication Game? \n\nAn entity can apply for a Commercial Communication Game permit via the Licensee Portal. Applications need to be accompanied by the relevant application fee of €25 or 0.5% of the total monetary or retail value of the prize, whichever is higher.\n\nWhat is the maximum stake of a Commercial Communication Game? \n\nIn the case of Commercial Communication Games, the purchase of the good or service is the entry requirement for participation. Where an additional participation fee is required, the value of the latter shall not exceed two euro (€2) per player, and the value of the prize shall not exceed two hundred and fifty euro (€250).\n\nWhat is the maximum prize that can be awarded for a Commercial Communication Game? \n\nAny prize relating to a single event that is covered by a Commercial Communication Game shall not exceed €50,000.\n\nIn the case of limited Commercial Communication Games, the prize shall not exceed €250.\n\nWhat are the limits on advertising? \n\nCommercial communications must not:\n\nCondone or encourage behaviour which is criminally or socially irresponsible;\nPortray gaming as a means of resolving problems;\nSuggest that gaming is an alternative to employment.\n\n\nGaming adverts cannot make reference to easily available means of credit, and cannot tarnish the image of any other licensee.\n\nAre there any other limitations to organise a Commercial Communication Game? \n\nCommercial Communication Games are not to cumulatively exceed €100,000 in prizes during any calendar month and not more than €500,000 during any calendar year.\n\nCompliance\nWhat is a Voluntary Surrender, and how can I apply for the termination of a Licence? \n\nA Voluntary Surrender is the voluntary termination of a Licence issued by the Authority. In cases where an Authorised Person wishes to surrender a Licence issued by the Authority, the Authorised Person shall submit a ‘Licence – Licence Surrender’ application, by visiting the MGA portal. The Authorised Person shall adhere to the termination procedures provided by the Authority which relate to players, the Authorised Person’s website, the Authorised Person’s gaming system, the Authorised Person’s duties and payable fees.\n\nThe application shall include the following information: a formal certified letter signed by one of the company directors, including a brief explanation as to why the entity wants to surrender the licence, and what will become of the entity following the surrender approval. The letter must also contain information regarding the date of termination, player operations, pending player funds, and winding up of jackpots.\n\nWhen are Incident Reports required to be submitted by the licensees? \n\nIncident Reports shall be submitted to the MGA for the following instances:\n\nAny breach of the licensee’s information security that adversely affects the confidentiality of information related to players;\nAny breach of the licensee’s information security that precludes players from accessing their accounts for a period exceeding twelve (12) hours;\nIn case of urgent changes to the essential components carried out to avoid a significant interruption of the licensee’s operations; and\nIn case of any unplanned changes to critical elements of the games.\nWhat is required when advertising? \nAdverts must be compliant with the requirements envisaged in the Gaming Commercial Communications Regulations (S.L. 583.09), including but not limited to, displaying the licensee’s name, licence number, the minimum age to participate and responsible gaming-related information.\nAdverts displayed on social media must also be compliant with the Regulations\nCompliance Audits\nWhat is a Compliance Audit? \n\nThe Authority may require any licensee to undergo a Compliance Audit, on a regular or ad hoc basis, in accordance with any binding instrument that may be issued by the Authority. This provided that only Compliance Audits carried out by auditors approved by the Authority shall be recognised by the Authority.\n\nWhat is the process around a Compliance Audit? \n\nOnce the Authority contacts a licensee stating that a Compliance Audit needs to be conducted, the licensee needs to engage an approved Compliance Auditor and submit a ‘Letter of Engagement’, as well as a ‘No Conflict-of-Interest’ declaration. From thereon, the engaged External Auditor has three (3) months to submit the complete Compliance Audit Report to the MGA. Following submission, the MGA's audit team conducts a review of the Compliance Audit Report and follows up with the licensee on any issues that arose during the audit.\n\nWhich are the approved audit service providers who can be engaged by licencees? \n\nSystem and Compliance Audit Service Providers\n\nName\tRegistration Number\tCountry of Registration\nBDO Technology Advisory Ltd\tC87755\tMalta\nCapstone Assurance Ltd\tC57993\tMalta\nDeloitte Advisory and Technology Limited\tC23487\tMalta\neCOGRA Ltd\t4690117\tUnited Kingdom\nFACT Technologies Limited\tC58224\tMalta\nFinanz-Audit Ltd\tC65281\tMalta\nGaming Associates Europe Limited\t9663955\tUnited Kingdom\nGCS Assurance Malta Limited\tC79687\tMalta\nGlobal Lab Ltd\tC93984\tMalta\nGLI Europe\t818473393\tNetherlands\nGrant Thornton\tC80426\tMalta\niTech Labs Italia S.R.L\tRM1282510\tItaly\nKPMG\tAB/26/84/12\tMalta\nKyte Consultants Ltd\tC39922\tMalta\nMalpep Ltd\tC98086\tMalta\nMAZARS Consulting Ltd\tC29387\tMalta\nNouv Audit Limited\tC66782\tMalta\nPriceWaterHouseCoopers\tAB/26/84/38\tMalta\nQUINEL Ltd\tC59317\tMalta\nRadix Technologies Ltd\tC97052\tMalta\nRSM Malta\tAB/26/84/53\tMalta\n\nStatutory Audit Service Providers\n\nName\tRegistration Number\tCountry\nAcubed Assurance Ltd\tC104324\tMalta\nAltima Assurance Limited\tC91283\tMalta\nBailey Audit Service Limited\tC53740\tMalta\nBDO Malta\tAB/26/84/06\tMalta\nBorg Galea Audit Limited\tC79290\tMalta\nCapstone Assurance Ltd\tC57993\tMalta\nCG Audit Limited\tC97404\tMalta\nCore Audit and Assurance Ltd\tC97823\tMalta\nDeloitte Audit Limited\tC51312\tMalta\nErnst & Young Malta Limited\tC30252\tMalta\nFACT Audit\tAB/2/15/15\tMalta\nFinanz-Audit Ltd\tC65281\tMalta\nGCS Assurance Malta Limited\tC79687\tMalta\nGrant Thornton\tC80426\tMalta\nGriffiths & Associates Ltd\tC58472\tMalta\nJohn Zammit & Associates (Audit & Assurance) Limited\tC104557\tMalta\nKPMG\tAB/26/84/12\tMalta\nMazars Malta\tAB/26/84/39\tMalta\nNCMB Auditing Ltd\tC97541\tMalta\nNouv Audit Limited\tC66782\tMalta\nPriceWaterHouseCoopers\tAB/26/84/38\tMalta\nRJV Audit Limited\tC78969\tMalta\nRSM Malta\tAB/26/84/53\tMalta\nVCA\tAB/26/84/46\tMalta\nZD Assurance Limited\tC66286\tMalta\n\nMore information may be found on this page.\n\nGames\nWhat are the different types of games that are licensable by the Authority? \n\nThe following are the Game Types authorised by the Authority:\n\nType 1: games of chance played against the house, the outcome of which is determined by a random generator, and shall include casino-type games, including roulette, blackjack, baccarat, poker played against the house, lotteries, secondary lotteries and virtual sports games; and/or\nType 2: games of chance played against the house, the outcome of which is not generated randomly, but is determined by the result of an event or competition extraneous to a game of chance, and whereby the operator manages his or her own risk by managing the odds offered to the player; and/or\nType 3: games of chance not played against the house and wherein the operator is not exposed to gaming risk, but generates revenue by taking a commission or other charge based on the stakes or the prize, and shall include player versus player games such as poker, bingo, betting exchange, and other commission-based games; and/or,\nType 4: controlled skill games as per regulation 8 of the Gaming Authorisations Regulations.\n\nIn the case of a game displaying elements which may fall under more than one of the types referred to above, the Authority shall have full discretion in categorising the game in the type it believes closest reflects the nature of the game.\n\nWhat is a vertical? \n\nBy definition, the term “gaming vertical” means a category of products that require specific safeguards in order to ensure that it is offered in a manner which adheres to the law and the regulatory objectives, owing to its characteristics and the distinction between it and other categories of products. For the sake of clarity, the different verticals include:\n\nCasino;\nLive casino;\nScratch Cards;\nLotteries;\nSecondary lotteries;\nFixed odds betting including live betting;\nPool betting, including betting exchange;\nPeer-to-peer Poker;\nOther commission-based, peer-to-peer games such as bingo, but excluding pool betting, betting exchange and poker;\nLottery messenger services;\nControlled skill games;\nAny other gaming vertical which is not comprised of the above.\nIs a separate licence required for each type of game? \n\nNo, the Authority does not require licensees to obtain a licence for each type of game. Operators that are already in possession of a Gaming Service Licence or Critical Gaming Supply Licence, and wish to offer an additional type of game are required to apply for the necessary approval through the Licensee Portal.\n\nWhere should the game rules for online games be displayed? \n\nAs a minimum, the entire set of rules, including the manner in which a player can win or lose a game, must be no further than one click away from the page on which the game can be played. Upon that one click, a player must be immediately presented with the rules. However, the rules may be categorised further within this window, possibly requiring further clicks due to the limitation of space, but they shall always remain easily accessible and easy to understand.\n\nWith respect to games which are played after being downloaded and installed on a compatible device, licensees shall ensure that the game rules shall be made present to the player in any case prior to the player’s first wager on the game.\n\nKey Functions\nWhat are key functions? \n\nBy definition, the term “key function” means an important function, role or task carried out by a person in connection with a gaming service or a gaming supply, as may be prescribed by the Gaming Authorisations and Compliance Directive (Directive 3 of 2018).\n\nKey Persons are required to have full knowledge, understanding and access to the applicant’s or licensee’s operations, as may be necessary for them to carry out their respective Key Function/s.\n\nApplicants are required to be fit and proper in order to carry out their respective roles, not only at the time of their application for a Key Function Certificate, but also on an ongoing basis thereafter.\n\nMore information may be found here: https://www.mga.org.mt/licensee-hub/applications/individuals/key-function-director/\n\nWhich are the key function roles? \n\nKey Functions vary per licence type, and the full list can be found within Part 2 of the Gaming Authorisations and Compliance Directive (Directive 3 of 2018).\n\nWhat are temporary Key Function roles? \n\nWhen a Key Function holder cannot exercise their function/s due to extenuating circumstances, a person not holding the certificate approval but having the necessary competencies may exercise such function/s on a temporary basis. In any such case, the Authority shall be notified forthwith and in no case later than twenty-four (24) hours after such person is vested with the exercise of the key function/s. Such a temporary exercise may not exceed one (1) calendar month, but may be renewed with the prior written approval of the Authority.\n\nWhat is Continuous Professional Development (CPD)? \n\nThe element of ongoing training and relevant Continuous Professional Development (CPD) is considered to be fundamental for ensuring that Key Persons are continuously up to date on developments in their respective fields, and thus remain fully equipped to carry out their designated roles. Eventually, when applying for the renewal of their Key Function Certificate, Key Persons shall be required to show that they have attained a minimum number of CPD hours during each calendar year of the previous certification period for each of their authorised Key Functions, in order for such renewal to be approved. The minimum number of CPDs required is outlined in the 'Key Function Eligibility Criteria Policy' document.\n\nKey Persons shall be required to fulfil the CPD requirements with respect to each of the Key Roles which they are authorised to fulfil upon their first application for renewal of their Key Function. Hence, no yearly reporting or notifications are required, prior to the renewal.\n\nWhat qualifies as CPD hours? \n\nThe following is an exhaustive list of methods applicable to the attainment of CPD requirements.\n\n\nUnless otherwise specified below, one (1) CPD hour is earned for each hour of active participation in qualifying professional educational activities, excluding lunches and breaks where applicable. CPD hours can also be earned in half-hour increments.\n\nProfessional Educational Activities: These activities include courses, in-house training, conferences, seminars, and workshops relevant to a given Key Function.\nPresentations: These activities include vendor or system-specific presentations relevant to a given Key function. A maximum of four (4) CPD hours per year can be attained through such activities.\nTeaching/Lecturing/Presenting: These activities include the development and delivery of presentations and courses relevant to Key Functions. In terms of such activities, CPD hours are earned at two (2) times the presentation time for the first delivery, e.g. a two-hour presentation earns four (4) CPD hours. CPD hours cannot be earned for subsequent presentations of the same material unless the content is substantially modified and/or updated.\nPublication of articles: These activities include the publication of material directly related to the designated Key Functions. Such publications must be credited to the Key Person and appear in a formal publication or website. CPD hours are earned on the basis of word count for the given publication so that one (1) CPD hour shall be awarded for every five hundred (500) words, provided that not more than five (5) CPD hours shall be awarded on the basis of such publications for a given year.\nProfessional Examinations: This activity pertains to the pursuit of examinations related to the individual’s designated Key Function. Two (2) CPD hours are earned for each examination in relation to which a passing score is achieved.\n\nParticipation or attendance of the activities mentioned above would be deemed relevant as CPD hours as long as the activity is related to the Key role held by the applicant. Key Persons authorised to carry out multiple Key Functions will be required to fulfil the relevant CPD requirements for each role. If, however, a given CPD activity is considered relevant for multiple Key Functions, this can be counted towards the fulfilment of the requirements of each respective role simultaneously.\n\nIn case of doubt, Key Persons may contact the Authority’s Compliance Department on [email protected] for confirmation of the relevance of a particular activity to a given role.\n\nLicence Applications\nHow can I apply for a licence? \n\nLicence applications can be submitted through the Licensee Portal, by selecting the New Licence Application. Applicants can apply by logging into the Portal and following the simple process steps. The Portal provides a dedicated timeline that will give users the possibility to follow the status of their requests in real-time, ensuring efficiency and transparency.\n\n\nFurther information with regard to the licence fees, the regulations & directives as well as the technical checklist can be found under the Regulatory Framework of the MGA website. The Portal's homepage provides a link to some tutorial videos, with common application requests.\n\nWhat types of licences are available? \n\nThe Authority may issue licences for the following categories:\n\nGaming Service licence:\nA business-to-consumer licence to offer or carry out a gaming service;\nCritical Gaming Supply licence:\nA business-to-business licence to supply and manage the material elements of a game; or\nA business-to-business licence to supply and manage the software, whether as a standalone or as part of a system, to generate, capture, control or otherwise process any essential regulatory record and/or the supply and management of the control system itself on which such software resides.\nWhat type of games require a licence? \n\nIn order for a game to be licensable by the Authority, the following criteria need to be present, cumulatively;\n\n(i) A stake to enable participation;\n(ii) The predominance of chance;\n(iii) A prize of money or money’s worth.\n\nWho can apply for a licence? \n\nAny entity established in the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA) is eligible to apply for a licence, as long as it meets the required Shared Capital requirements and the annual Financial Statements reporting requirements.\n\nWhere the applicant for a licence is a body corporate, such an applicant may apply for a licence either for himself only or for its corporate group. In the latter option, all references in these regulations to an applicant shall be deemed to refer to each and all members of the corporate group, and where such licence is granted, each member of the corporate group and all of them jointly and severally shall be deemed to be a licensee.\n\nWhat happens when an application is submitted to the Authority? \n\nFollowing the submission of the application, the Authority will verify the settlement of payment, as well as conduct a preliminary check to ensure that the application is complete.\nAny incomplete applications will be set to a one-time ‘incomplete’ status for sixty days. If the application is not re-submitted in full within this period, the application will be rejected and closed off.\n\n\nOnce the application is accepted, the applicant is informed of the status and notified with respect to who will be the main point of contact for the licence application.\nThe MGA may require further information and/or amendments, as well as the submission of required documents to complete the application review according to the gaming legislation.\n\nWould the Authority acknowledge an application once it is submitted? \n\nApplications, once submitted, can be viewed and accessed from the licensee’s, or the applicant’s timeline on the Licensee Portal. Gaming licences are immediately assigned to an Authorisations team, and the applicant receives an official confirmation via email that the licence application has been received successfully, if the application submission is deemed to be complete at face value.\n\nHow long does one have to go-live after getting the licence? \n\nLicensees are given a period of 90 days to go live, after issuance of the licence. However, licence fees, compliance contribution and gaming tax are due from the date of issuance of the licence. The licensee shall be required to submit a Declaration of Go-Live application by no less than two (2) days prior to the go-live date indicated within the declaration, whereby such an application can be found through the Licensee Portal. In the case that a licensee does not go live within this stipulated timeframe, the licensee will be required to apply for a Voluntary Licence Suspension from the Licensee Portal (Licence – Voluntary Licence Suspension), for a maximum extension of 9 months\n\nDoes the Authority charge any fees to operators who wish to hold a meeting with the Authority? \n\nNo, the Authority does not charge any fees for meetings held with applicants, licensees or service providers.\n\nWhat types of services can be outsourced? \n\nThe Authority is conscious of the fact that outsourcing is integral to the operational setup of most gaming businesses nowadays, whether for advantages of cost or specialisation or for any other reason which the operator may deem relevant. The type of supplies considered to be supplementary to the activity being licensed can be found within the Outsourcing Policy.\n\nWhat is the minimum issued paid-up share capital required by the Authority? \n\nThe Authority requires a company applying for a licence to have the following minimum issued paid-up share capital when registering the company with the competent authority:\n\n\nGaming Service Licence:\n\nType 1 – Minimum €100,000\nType 2 – Minimum €100,000\nType 3 – Minimum €40,000\nType 4 – Minimum €40,000\n\nCritical Gaming Supply Licence:\n\nMinimum €40,000\n\nCompanies with multiple type approvals are required to meet the above share capital requirements cumulatively up to a maximum capping of €240,000.\n\nCompanies having or applying for a Corporate Licence are required to have the minimum Share Capital in any one of the entities forming part of the Corporate Licence.\n\nWhat is a major change? \n\nAny major changes occurring throughout the term of a licence application will require a new licence application to be submitted accordingly. Major Changes include:\n\nAny changes affecting more than 75% equity ownership, control or funding of the prospective applicant;\nAny changes that require a new Business Plan to be submitted, such as major changes to the products to be offered or the respective markets, requiring the submission of revised Financial Projections; and\nAny other changes that would necessitate a new review of the submitted policies and procedures and other documentation.\n\nIn order to aid applicants, in cases of major changes, any information submitted to the Authority that would still be valid will not need to be resubmitted again. However, any other updated documents, forms and/or information, together with the application form details will still need to be submitted in full through the Licensee Portal together with the respective application fee.\n\nHow can a person appeal a decision of the Authority? \n\nAny person who feels aggrieved by a decision of the Authority may enter, within twenty days after the date of service upon him of notice of the Authority’s decision, an appeal to the Administrative Review Tribunal in accordance with article 43 of the Gaming Act (Chapter 583 of the Laws of Malta).\n\nLicence Fees\nWhat is the licence fee and when is it due? \n\nAny person in possession of a gaming service or a critical gaming supply licence issued by the Authority shall pay to the Authority a licence fee that depends on the type of approval in line with the Gaming Licence Fee Regulations (S.L. 583.03), which may be found on the Authority’s website. The initial licence fee needs to be paid at the last step of the application process, prior to the issuing of the licence. Yearly licence fees then need to be paid upfront in advance, and are non-refundable.\n\nWhat is the gaming tax and when is it due? \n\nGaming tax due in terms of the Gaming Tax Regulations (S.L. 583.10) is based on the gaming revenue, generated by the operators from end customers located in Malta.\n\n\nThe gaming tax shall be payable monthly, together with the submission of regulatory returns containing the relevant data to calculate the said tax.\n\n\nFurther information is clearly stated under the Gaming Tax Regulations (S.L. 583.10), which may be found on the Authority’s website.\n\nWhat is the Compliance Contribution? \n\nCompliance Contribution is a contribution payable on qualifying activities, which are determined in the manner stipulated in Part A of the First Schedule of the Gaming Licence Fees Regulations (S.L. 583.03) by reference to the gaming revenue generated during the licence period from the gaming services offered. Compliance Contribution is payable on qualifying activities consisting of Type 1, Type 2, Type 3 and Type 4.\nThis shall be determined by the gaming revenue generated during the licence period depending on the type of gaming services approved (minimum compliance contribution fee is applicable).\n\nInformation relating to the Compliance Contribution fee can be found in the Gaming Licence Fees Regulations (S.L. 583.03), which may be found on the Authority’s website.\n\nLimited Commercial Communication Games\nHow do I apply for a Limited Commercial Communication Game? \n\nAn entity can apply for a Commercial Communication Game permit via the MGA’s Licensee Portal.

A player can request self-barring from all premises where gambling is offered, which will prevent the player from accessing land-based premises for the duration of the self-barring timeframe.\n\nThe timeframes for a self-barring are either for 6 months, 12 months, or 12 months with an automatic renewal.\n\nLand-Based Gaming: What is the process for actioning a Self-Barring? \n\nTo obtain a self-barring from land-based gaming premises, the player must request this at the Operator’s reception area, where a form will need to be completed and signed, along with a copy of the player’s proof of ID and a photograph of the player.\n\nAlternatively, players can request a land-based self-barring from either the Malta Gaming Authority’s premises in SmartCity, Kalkara, or from the Responsible Gaming Foundation offices in Fleur-de-Lys, Birkirkara.\n\nLand-Based Gaming: Can a player enter a casino/gaming parlour/bingo hall with an active self-barring? \n\nIf a player has a current self-barring, this applies to all premises where gambling is offered. For the duration of the self-barring, the player cannot enter any MGA-licensed gambling premises, except to discuss matters relating to the self-barring itself, such as increasing the timeframe etc. This exclusion also includes entering any bars, restaurants or any other facilities which are located within the gambling premises.\n\nLand-Based Gaming: Can a player remove an active self-barring? \n\nWhen a player sets a self-barring, this would be for either 6 months, 12 months, or 12 months with an auto-renewal. Once this has been set, it cannot be removed until the timeframe has expired, when the self-barring will automatically be removed.\n\nRegarding the 12-month self-barring with auto-renewal option, whilst the self-barring aspect cannot be removed, the auto-renewal aspect can be removed by completing the Self-Barring Auto-Renew Form.\n\nLand-Based Gaming: Can a licensed land-based operator impose a self-barring? \n\nA land-based operator cannot impose a self-barring on a player. However, if the Licensee has sufficient reason to believe that the player may be experiencing gambling-related harm, they can exclude a player from their premises.\n\nRemote Gaming: Why is responsible gambling so important? \n\nThe overriding objectives are to promote responsible gambling, prevent the occurrence of problematic gambling, and to safeguard players’ rights. The aim is to ensure that all players can gamble in a safe, secure, and sustainable manner, mitigating the risk of gambling problems or gambling-related harm. Moreover, it is imperative that Licensees operate in a manner which is open, transparent, and that they implement preventive measures to mitigate the occurrence of gambling-related harm. This is a shared responsibility between the Player, the Operator, and the Authority.\n\nRemote Gaming: What Responsible Gambling/Player Protection content must be displayed on-site? \n\nLicensed operators must display on their website:\n\nThe Licensee details.\nA sign which indicates that underage gaming is not permissible.\nA ‘responsible gaming’ message, explaining that gaming can be harmful if it is not controlled, and information about the player support measures on the website.\nA dynamic seal or kite mark.\nA link leading to a webpage or application which includes all relevant responsible gaming information required by the Directive. This information must be clear and intelligible, and within one click from anywhere on the website.\nA link which enables players to refer to one or more gambling help organisations.\nA message before first deposit, providing information and access to available responsible gaming tools and limits.\nRemote Gaming: Are there any mandatory responsible gambling tools which must be offered to players? \n\nIn line with the Player Protection Directive (Directive 2 of 2018), Operators licensed by the Malta Gaming Authority must offer players the ability to self-exclude for either a definite or indefinite timeframe. The ability to self-exclude must be simple and easily accessible.\n\nMoreover, it is mandatory that Operators must also offer players the ability to set either Deposit Limits or Wagering Limits as well as providing players with the ability to set Reality Checks, to assist in maintaining control of their gambling.\n\n\nWhat other responsible gambling tools can be made available to players?\nAs well as the mandatory tools which Operators must make available to players as a minimum, Operators are strongly encouraged to also offer:\n\nBoth Deposit Limits and Wagering Limits. At present the Player Protection Directive (Directive 2 of 2018) mandates that either of the limits be offered to players however, the Authority encourages Operators to offer both limits.\nLoss Limits, which allows a player to limit the amount of money that can be lost within a given timeframe; usually daily, weekly, or monthly.\nTime Limits or Session Limits, which allow a player to limit the amount of time which they spend playing.\nTime Outs/Short Breaks, which work in much the same way that a self-exclusion does except for that the duration is for a timeframe of more than 24 hours and not more than 30 days.\nRemote Gaming: What happens if a minor accesses and uses the site? \n\nIf a minor or underage person creates an account, deposits funds, and uses gaming services, as soon as the Operator becomes aware that the account holder is underage, they are required to close the account and to refund all deposits made by the player.\n\nAny excess winnings made by the minor are to be confiscated by the Operator.\n\nRemote Gaming: What is the difference between a general account closure and a self-exclusion? \n\nWhen a player requests an account closure this means that should the player wish to reopen the account later, they may do so simply by requesting this from the customer service team. Whilst general account closures can be requested for many different reasons or no reason at all, it is important that the Operator confirms with the player that the closure request has not been made due to gambling issues or problematic gambling. Probing a player’s responses during this conversation is recommended to ensure that the Operator is entirely satisfied that the closure request is not related to gambling harm.\n\n\nWhilst an account which has simply been closed can be reopened later upon request, if the player mentions problematic gambling or any issues related to their control of their gambling, the Operator must set a self-exclusion on the account. The self-exclusion can be for either a definite or indefinite timeframe, dependent on the player’s request, the information provided by the player, and the Operator’s discretion, which only extends so far as increasing the self-exclusion timeframe. The Operator must never apply a self-exclusion for a shorter timeframe than the player’s request, nor attempt to persuade or induce a player to set a lesser timeframe.\n\n\nA self-exclusion is different to a general account closure, as a self-exclusion is a responsible gambling tool which prevents a player from gaining access to the account for either a set timeframe, or indefinitely. If a self-exclusion is set, the account can only be reopened once the exclusion has expired, or on the Player’s request, at the operator’s discretion. Self-exclusions are designed to allow players to take a break from gambling, with the further security that there are additional steps to reopen the account.\n\nRemote Gaming: Can self-exclusions be product-specific? \n\nAll Licensees are required to always offer players the ability to self-exclude from all gaming activity for either a definite or an indefinite timeframe. However, the Player Protection Directive (Directive 2 of 2018) does allow Licensees the option to offer self-exclusions which are product-specific or set for a particular gaming vertical. However, please note that this is an optional self-exclusion and not an alternative to either a definite or indefinite self-exclusion.\n\n\nAs Licensees are not required to offer the ability to self-exclude for a specific product or gaming vertical, this may not be available across all Licensees.\n\nRemote Gaming: Can a player access their account following a self-exclusion? \n\nOperators licensed by the MGA are obliged to offer players the option to self-exclude either for a definite or an indefinite timeframe. When a definite self-exclusion is set, players do have the option to extend or decrease the period which the self-exclusion is in place for.\n\n\nWhen increasing a self-exclusion timeframe, the player must contact the operator, who will increase the self-exclusion immediately upon receiving the request. There is no cool-off period when increasing a self-exclusion.\n\nRemote Gaming: When is the player allowed to decrease or revoke a self-exclusion? \n\nA player can request at any time that their self-exclusion timeframe is shortened or removed entirely. To do this, the player must make their request to the Operator in writing, detailing why the self-exclusion was imposed and how circumstances have now changed making the self-exclusion unnecessary. It is at the Operator’s discretion whether to accept or decline the request.\n\n\nShould the Operator accept the request to decrease or revoke a definite self-exclusion, the account cannot be opened until after the lapse of at least twenty-four (24) hours from the time which the Operator accepts the request.\n\n\nIf the request relates to an indefinite self-exclusion, the player’s account cannot be reopened until after the lapse of at least seven (7) days from the day on which the request to decrease or revoke the self-exclusion was accepted.\n\nRemote Gaming: Is a self-exclusion applied across all brands operated by a Licensee? \n\nA player can self-exclude across all brands which a Licensee offers on request. When a Licensee operates multiple brands with a separate registration for each, and a player requests a self-exclusion for any reason other than responsible gambling issues, the Licensee can apply the self-exclusion solely to the brand where the request was made.\n\n\nIf the request has been made due to problematic gambling, the player must be self-excluded from all brands which the Licensee operates, irrespective of whether the player holds an account with that brand.\n\n\nWhen players request a self-exclusion due to problem gambling issues, the Authority encourages Licensees to emphasise with players that they should also exclude any accounts they hold with all other Licensees, and that they make use of the available blocking software to prevent access to gambling sites.\n\nRemote Gaming: How long should a definite self-exclusion last? \n\nWhilst there are no set timeframes which Operators must offer for a definite self-exclusion; the Authority encourages Operators to offer the below timeframes:\n\n24 Hours\n48 Hours\n7 Days\n30 Days\n90 Days\n180 Days\n365 Days\nRemote Gaming: If a player has more than one gambling limit, which limit takes precedence? \n\nWhere a player applies multiple responsible gambling limits, the strictest limit must always take precedence.\n\nFor example, a player sets a €20 per day and a €40 per week wager limits.\nOn day 1, the player wagers €20, and is prevented from wagering any further (the strictest limit is applied).\nOn day 2, €18 is wagered. As this is below the €20 daily wagering limit, the player limit does not kick in and prevent the player from gambling further.\nOn day 3, despite the customer having a €20 per day wager limit, the player can only wager €2, as combined throughout the week, the player would have wagered €40, and so this becomes the stricter limit which must be imposed.\n\nIf the player was to wager another €2 at any point during the week, they would now be prevented from wagering for the remainder of the week, as they would have triggered the stricter limit.\n\nRemote Gaming: What timeframe do Operators have to comply with an ADR decision? \n\nShould an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) entity decide in favour of the player, the Operator has 20 days in which to comply with this decision.\n\nRemote Gaming: Do Operators have to comply with ADR decisions? \n\nOperators are required to fully comply with any decision given by their Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) entity.\n\nFailure to fully comply with a decision given by an ADR entity may result in enforcement action being taken against the Operator.\n\nRemote Gaming: Do Operators have to engage an ADR entity? \n\nOperators licensed by the MGA are required to engage an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) entity to manage disputes escalated externally, prior to going live with operations.\n\nFailure to engage and maintain an ADR entity whilst operating may result in enforcement action being taken against the Operator.\n\nHow are player funds protected? \n\nThe sub-section ‘Protection of Player Funds’ is clearly stated under the Gaming Player Protection Regulations.\n\n\nIt highlights the importance of player funds being kept segregated and remaining separately identifiable at all times whereby the Authority may, at its sole discretion, exercise viewing rights over the common account of player funds.\n\nWhat is the process to submit a player complaint to the Authority or an ADR entity? \n\nWhere a player feels aggrieved by a decision or other action of the authorised person, they shall be able to make a complaint to the authorised person and, in the event that they are not satisfied by the response of the authorised person, the player may (with the handed procedure by the authorised person) refer such complaint and all relevant facts to the Authority’s Player Support Unit or to another Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) entity.\n\nWhat is the process that a licensee should make readily available to those players who wish to submit a complaint? \n\nAuthorised persons offering a gaming service shall make readily available to players the applicable procedure for making a complaint to the authorised person.\n\na. Authorised persons offering a gaming service shall, upon receipt of a complaint made by a player who makes or has made use of their gaming service, immediately inquire into the complaint;\n\n\nb. Authorised persons shall inform the complainant of the results of such inquiry within ten days from the date on which the complaint is received; Provided that where the nature of the inquiry is such that more time is necessary to complete it, such period may be extended by a further ten days; Provided further that where such extension is necessary, the player shall be informed within the first ten days from the date of receipt of the complaint that the authorised person shall be making use of such extension, and the reason or reasons why such extension is warranted.\n\nRecognition Notices\nWhat is a Recognition Notice? \n\nA Recognition Notice is the process whereby an authorisation issued by another Member State of the European Union or European Economic Area, or a State which is deemed by the Authority to offer safeguards largely equivalent to those offered by Maltese law, is recognised as having the same effect as an authorisation issued by the Authority for the purpose of providing a gaming service, gaming supply in or from Malta. Once this is confirmed, the applicant is provided with a Recognition Notice Certificate, which needs to be maintained on a yearly basis.\n\nSports Betting Integrity\nIf an operator has an MGA licence but the customers whose bets are being considered suspicious fall within the remit of another licence, should they also be included in a report being filed on the SBRM? \n\nIt is highly important to report any suspicious sporting events to the relevant Sports Governing Body (SGB), in conjunction with the report being submitted via the Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism (some entities are affiliated with a betting monitoring body and hence a report to the SGB is done via said betting monitoring body). The Sports Betting Integrity department at the MGA always queries whether an operator has reported such an event to the relevant SGB.\n\nI have already sent most of the required data to the relevant SGB, but I have not sent them all of the personal data due to internal data protection measures. If we decide not to share all of this data with the relevant SGB, could I just send all of the required data directly to the MGA, as opposed to sending similar data out twice? \n\nSome operators do not find any issues in directly sharing betting data with the Sports Governing Bodies (SGB) requesting it directly from them. However, other operators may only accept to exchange that data via the regulator alone. Having said that, whenever the MGA corresponds a request for information (RFI) to the industry, the data being requested from the operators would then be transferred securely to the SGB only when an SGB submits a formal RFI to the MGA confirming that the data is being requested on the basis of an investigation into the potential manipulation of sports competitions.\n\nShould I (the operator) be reporting all accounts involved in participant breaches or only those that fall under the remit of the MGA? \n\nIn cases involving a participant breach but not necessarily entailing a suspicious event, only suspicious betting accounts falling within the remit of the MGA licence ought to be reported. However, if an event would be deemed suspicious due to activity emanating from such account holders, then the MGA would still require that it is notified of such an event (if the said event was offered to bettors falling within the remit of the MGA licence also).\n\nWhen the MGA asks how many suspicious accounts have been recorded in the IPRs, are you referring to accounts falling within the remit of the MGA licence, or in general? \n\nWhen the Authority requests betting data, it is only requesting betting data of account holders that fall within the remit of the MGA licence. Therefore, when the MGA asks in the Industry Performance Returns (IPRs) how many suspicious accounts have been recorded, the MGA is only referring to those that fall under its remit.\n\nI (the operator) want to submit a report to the SBI department, but I have issues in accessing or using the SBRM via the Licensee Portal. What is the procedure in successfully registering an account on the portal and in receiving the necessary rights to be able to use the SBRM successfully? \n\nTo be able to access the portal and the Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism (SBRM), the Access Rights Administrator of the operator submitting the report must provide the necessary rights (of an Approver) to the individual accessing the SBRM.\n\n\nFor guidance on how to make use of the mechanism, the Authority has published a manual which acts as a point of reference when reporting suspicious betting activity to the MGA.\n\nWhen I (the operator) submit a report using the SBRM via the MGA portal, what is the level of information that I should report pertinent to the suspicious event or suspicious account that I will be reporting? \n\nA detailed explanation regarding the suspicious behaviour noted should be given. All information that can be provided would be appreciated and would avoid any additional emails requesting further clarifications. B2C licensed operators should also communicate the relevant betting data falling under the MGAs remit at the reporting stage.\n\nWhen I (the operator) submit a report using the SBRM via the MGA portal, is it a must to also report any suspicious event or suspicious account to the SGB? Do I need to inform the MGA if I have (or have not) already reported such suspicious event or suspicious account to the relevant SGB at the time of submitting a report via the SBRM? \n\nIt is highly important to report any suspicious sporting events to the relevant Sports Governing Body (SGB), in conjunction with the report being submitted via the Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism (SBRM). However, whether an operator reports to an SGB or not, remains at the discretion of the operator. When submitting a report, it is highly important that the operator clarifies if such event was reported to the relevant SGB, in order for the department to determine whether the MGA should report it on their behalf.\n\nI (the operator) am facing a technical issue regarding the SBRM. Therefore, I have submitted a ticket via the MGA helpdesk. What can I do in the meantime until this ticket is handled by the relevant department? \n\nWhen an operator submits a ticket via the MGA helpdesk, it would be beneficial for the operator to also inform the Sports Betting Integrity (SBI) department regarding the issue in question, since such tickets are handled by the MGA’s IT department, and the SBI department does not have visibility over such tickets. Hence, the SBI department will be in a better position with the operator to find an alternative working process until the issue is resolved.\n\nI (the operator) have received an RFI or an alert from the SBI department regarding a suspicious event that occurred after 01 January 2021. Since the event occurred after 01 January 2021, the obligation to report suspicious betting through the SBRM was already in force. However, we did not report such event through the SBRM as when we evaluated the degree of suspicion, we determined that it was not high enough to report. At the time we received the RFI or alert, and upon re-reviewing the event being queried, we now consider the event as suspicious and we wish to report and inform the SBI department accordingly. What should we do in this case? \n\nShould it be the case that a licensed entity reports an event following a request for information (RFI) by the MGA, the Sports Betting Integrity (SBI) department would then kindly request the operator to report the relevant suspicious event/s via the MGA’s Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism (SBRM). Such operator should attach the relevant betting data requested in the formal RFI corresponded via the Enclosures section of the SBRM.\n\nI (the operator) have submitted a report regarding a suspicious event via the SBRM. After such a report, I have received a formal RFI from the SBI department requesting the relevant betting data. How should I correspond the relevant betting data? \n\nWhen an operator reports a suspicious event via the Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism (SBRM) and the Sports Betting Integrity (SBI) department requests the relevant betting data, the MGA expects the relevant betting data to be communicated via the SBRM. The MGA highlights the fact that at reporting stage, betting data is being requested to be provided via the SBRM if such betting data falls under the MGA’s remit. If not, clarification under which jurisdiction the relevant betting data falls under should be highlighted.\n\nWhat does the alerting process refer to? \n\nThe MGA is alerting its licensees with any knowledge of suspicious betting activity, without revealing the source of the information. When receiving an alert, there is no need to revert with a reply should no suspicious betting activity be recorded on any of the events noted in the alert. If suspicious betting is recorded by an operator after receiving an alert, then the suspicious event in question is to be reported via the Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism (SBRM).\n\nWhat is the difference between the alerting process and the Request for Information process? \n\nThe alerting process is separate from the Request for Information process. When an alert is communicated, the MGA expects that licensees will be able to review (or re-review) the betting activity surrounding the event being indicated in the alert, as this will increase the odds of recognising any suspicious behaviour (if there is any). If suspicious betting is recorded by an operator after receiving an alert, then the suspicious event in question is to be reported via the Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism (SBRM).\n\nWith regards to the Request for Information process, the MGA sends a Request for Information when the Authority is officially requesting betting data (if the operator does indeed deem the event as suspicious). Therefore, in the Request for Information process, the MGA requires a reply informing it if suspicious activity was indeed recorded on such request or not before the set deadline is met.\n\nWhen the relevant betting data falls under the remit of the MGA, where should we communicate such betting data? \n\nThe relevant betting data should be corresponded in the Enclosures section of the report via the Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism (SBRM) at reporting stage if such betting data falls under the MGAs remit. If not, clarification under which jurisdiction the relevant betting data falls should be highlighted.\n\nHow should betting data be communicated? \n\nLicensees that offer a gaming service (B2C) are to provide betting data in a spreadsheet file format (specifically “.xls”) so that it may be viewed using Microsoft Excel. If betting data is being requested after a Request for Information has been communicated, then the data requested needs to also be provided in the order as is requested.\n\nWhen should we expect alerts to be corresponded by the MGA? \n\nAlerts are corresponded by the Sports Betting Integrity department with the Malta-licensed betting operators every Friday.\n\nTo whom are Sports Integrity related matters corresponded to by the MGA? \n\nSports Integrity related matters (including Alerts and Requests for Information) are corresponded with the licensee’s appointed Key Compliance and the relevant contact email of the departments designated to cater for sports integrity-related issues. Licensees who wish to include a department email address (not a personal address) should do so by informing the Sports Betting Integrity department on [email protected].\n\nStart-ups\nWhat qualifies for Start-Up status? \n\nA ‘start-up’ undertaking shall mean a person who, at the date of the licence application, fulfils all of the following criteria:\n\n\na. A person has been established or operational in the same or a related sector for less than five (5) years;\nProvided that, unless the business is operated in a different form, ‘established’ shall refer to the date of registration of a limited liability company, the date of the agreement establishing a partnership, the date of registration as a self-employed person, or as may otherwise be determined by the Authority.\n\n\nb. In the case of a body corporate, that person has not yet distributed profits;\n\n\nc. In the case of a body corporate, that person has not been formed through a merger or, if formed through a merger, all body corporates that formed part of the merger, satisfy, in aggregate, all the critical envisaged herein;\n\n\nd. That person has not acquired the business as a going concern or, if so, the acquirer and the acquired both satisfied all criteria envisaged herein;\n\n\ne. That person has generated actual revenue from the same, or a related, sector during the previous thirty-six months amounting to less than ten million euro (€10,000,000):\nProvided that where the financial period cannot be determined or is not applicable, the previous thirty-six (36) calendar months shall be taken into consideration;\nand\nProvided that where the financial period cannot be determined, or is not applicable, the previous twelve (12) calendar months shall be taken into consideration;\nf. That person is not part of, or controlled by, a corporate group whose actual revenue in the same, or a related sector within the previous thirty-six months exceeds ten million euro (€10,000,000): Provided that where the financial period cannot be determined or is not applicable, the previous thirty-six (36) calendar months shall be taken into consideration; and\n\n\ng. That person is not subject to the requirement of a Government concession to offer the gaming service in accordance with the proviso to regulation 4 of the Gaming Authorisations Regulations;\nProvided that in the case of a body corporate, if the person referred to in this sub-regulation has taken over the business from any person having a qualifying interest in the former, the provisions of this sub-regulation shall extend accordingly to the person having a qualifying interest in the applicant: Provided further that actual revenue referred to in paragraphs (e) and (f) shall be determined on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles and practice as defined in article 2(4) of the Compliance Act.\n\n\nA person shall be deemed to be a start-up undertaking only upon the Authority’s confirmation, and the Authority shall be vested with discretion to determine whether a person is a start-up undertaking in terms of set regulations. Provided that the onus to prove that a person is indeed a start-up undertaking shall be vested in the same applicant.\n\nIs a Start-up required to pay compliance contribution? \n\nApproved start-ups will benefit from a moratorium period of 12 months from the date of issuance of the licence in which they are exempt from paying Compliance Contribution although they are still required to submit the monthly player funds declaration. Annual Fixed licence fees will still be due.\n\nTechnical\nWhat are the essential components for the set-up of a licensee’s operation? \n\nEssential components are the:\n\nComponents hosting Random Number Generators;\nComponents hosting jackpots;\nComponents hosting the games;\nGaming database;\nPlayer database;\nFinancial database;\nControl system; and\nAny other component which the Authority may deem to be critical.\n\nHow can a licensee effect changes to their key technical infrastructure? \n\nKey Technical Setup is the technical infrastructure of a licensee, including all hardware and virtual machines in operation where the essential components are located.\n\n\nLicensees may request the Authority’s approval to implement any changes within the essential components by submitting a Technical – Changes to Key Essential Components application through the Licensee Portal.\nThe Portal provides a dedicated dashboard that will give users the possibility to follow the status of their requests in real-time, ensuring efficiency and transparency.\n\nCan a licensee share a website and/or wallet with licensees from another jurisdiction? \n\nGames, and/or their providers, which are not licensed by the MGA or a competent authority within the EU/EEA, but licensed and offered under the purview of other jurisdictions outside the EU/EEA, on the same website as the MGA-licensed operations, or linked therefrom, are not permissible.\n\nSimilarly, shared wallet setups with such non-EU/EEA licensed games, whether offered on the same or different domain or sub-domain name, are also prohibited.\n\nVirtual Financial Assets/Distributed Ledger Technologies\nHow long will the duration of the sandbox period be? \n\nThe sandbox environment has been extended to 28 February 2023.\n\nHow should licensees calculate the exchange rate for reporting purposes? \n\nFor the purpose of the sandbox regulatory framework, the exchange rate used shall be that of the VFA exchange designated by the licensee, which shall be declared by the licensee to the MGA.\n\nCan licensees use custom tokens? \n\nLicensees may sell their custom tokens for fiat currency on their own platform, in order for players to make use of such tokens on the licensee’s platform itself, provided that the custom tokens may not be taken out of the licensee’s platform and any withdrawals are to be made in fiat currency after converting the custom tokens, on the licensee’s platform, at the same exchange rate at which they were acquired.\n\nCan gaming websites act as a crypto exchange? \n\nExchanging between one VC and another shall not take place within the licensee’s ecosystem.\n\nWhat happens in instances where control over the wallet cannot be verified? \n\nIn accordance with applicable AML/CFT obligations, if control over the wallet cannot be verified, any pending transactions shall be logged, the licensee shall freeze the amounts, and:\n\nIf a player claims to have deposited from such address within fifteen (15) days, or such longer period as the operator may stipulate in its terms and conditions, the amount may be assigned to such player’s account if control over the wallet is fully verified;\nIf no player makes such claim, or control over the wallet is not successfully verified, the operator shall appropriate the funds and shall make use thereof for responsible gaming purposes.\nWhat are the ‘Know Your Client’ requirements applicable to sandbox participants? \n\nThe threshold triggering Customer Due Diligence obligations in terms of section 3.3.2 of the Implementing Procedures issued by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) for the remote gaming sector, shall be one hundred and fifty euro (€150). Where smart contracts are used to automate withdrawals, verification shall be fully completed before any wager may be made.\n\nWhat are the limits in place for the sandbox environment? \n\nLicensees are required to maintain player-specified limits for fiat currencies. In the case of VFAs, licensees are required to incorporate a separate player-specified ceiling for Virtual Financial Assets (VFAs) that is distinct from the fiat currency limit.\n\n\nThroughout the duration of the sandbox and without prejudice to limits required in terms of Part V of the Player Protection Directive (Directive 2 of 2018), licensees may not accept deposits in VFA by a player exceeding the equivalent of one thousand euro (€1,000) per month. Where a player elects to set a player-specified limit in accordance with the Player Protection Directive, the licensee shall give the player the option to set such limit both for fiat currency and for VFAs.\n\nWhat are the verification requirements that need to be undertaken when participating in the sandbox environment? \n\nPlayers depositing in Virtual Currencies (VC) need to complete the verification process within thirty (30) days of the first deposit.\n\n\nThe wallet address shall form part of the player’s registered identity with an operator, and the player’s control over such wallet shall be verified prior to any deposit being made from it.\n\n\nFollowing the verification of control over the wallet prior to the player’s first deposit, there may be instances where the wallet address is changed due to, inter alia, security-related reasons. In such cases, the verification of the player’s control over such wallet shall be carried out on a risk sensitive basis, in accordance with the applicable AML/CFT obligations.\n\nWhat are the documents that need to be submitted in order to participate in the sandbox environment? \n\nThe documentation that needs to be submitted is listed in sections 6 and 7 of the System Documentation Checklist.\n\nWhat are the requirements applicable to third-party service providers? \n\nLicensees may wish to make use of third-party service providers that accept Virtual Financial Assets (VFAs )from players, whilst allowing the operator itself to deal solely in fiat currency. In accordance with the VFA Act and the subsidiary legislation issued thereunder, such service providers shall require a VFA licence.\n\nHow can licensees obtain an approval in order to make use of distributed ledger technology (DLT)? \n\nAny licensee that wishes to obtain an approval shall apply in the following manner, through the Licensee Portal:\n\n\n(i) Prospective licensees need to apply for an approval to accept DLT assets and, or use innovative technology arrangements as part of a ‘New Licence Application’;\n\n(ii) Existing licensees can apply for approval for the acceptance of DLT assets through the application type ‘Operational – Payment Methods’; and additional currencies can be added under the already approved payment method with the application type ‘Updated Documentation’.\n\n(iii) Existing licensees can apply for an approval for the use of innovative technology arrangements through the application type ‘Technical – Changes to Key Essential Components’.\n\nBack to Licensee Hub FAQs\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The Authority takes all the necessary steps in ensuring all its operators are fair, transparent, and compliant with all the measures in place. We are committed to keeping gambling free from crime, and to ensure that all players are protected.\n\n \n\nOur responsibility as regulators is to ensure that gambling establishments adhere to regulations when interacting with customers and promoting gambling products.\n\nWe can investigate and take appropriate action if businesses don’t follow the rules or there are concerns about how a business is run.\n\nIn addition, we collaborate with other regulators, charities, and organizations to comprehend gambling patterns and trends, advocate for safer gambling methods, and guarantee the safety of gambling.\n\nStaying Safe When Gambling\nThink about Your Gambling \n\nPeople gamble for a variety of reasons, some of which can change over time. It might be helpful to consider the reason you gamble, such as whether it is a social activity or has become a habit.\n\nBe aware of any changes in your gambling motivations by carefully considering them.\n\nReach out for Support if Needed \n\nThere are many organisations available to assist players who may be having difficulties in controlling their gambling or experiencing gambling related harm. We have included links below to some organisations which can provide support, guidance and assistance in overcoming problematic gambling. These organisations not only assist a player, but also provide guidance and support to family and friends, or anyone who is concerned about someone’s gambling.\n\nResponsible Gaming Foundation\n\nSEDQA\n\nCARITAS\n\nQuitGamble\n\nGaming Limits and Reality Checks \n\nThere are tools available that help players set budgets and time limits:\n\nDeposit Limits – Limits the amount of money that can be deposited within a set timeframe; usually daily, weekly or monthly.\n\nWagering Limits – Limits the amount of money wagered within a timeframe.\n\nLoss Limits – Limits the amount of money that can be lost within a set timeframe; usually daily, weekly or monthly.\n\nTime Limits or Session Limits –Limits the amount of time spent playing.\nWhen setting a limit, it is advisable to consider income, expenses and the amount which the player can afford to lose, thus ensuring that the limit set is realistic and effective.\n\nFor repetitive game of chance such as slots, players can set an alert for certain time intervals. Such alert will suspend play and acts as a reminder to stay in control. Information about the time spent playing, wagered amounts, and winnings/losses during the session are also provided and the player must confirm that the message has been read, before proceeding with gameplay.\n\nOnline Operators - Self-Exclusion \n\nA self-exclusion is a tool which prevents players from gambling by blocking access to the gaming website which the player has excluded with. Self-exclusions can be for either a definite or indefinite timeframe, and players can choose to extend a definite exclusion timeframe.\n\nDuring a self-exclusion, players are prevented from gambling, however, funds held on account are not forfeited and can still be withdrawn. It is advisable that when requesting an exclusion, any remaining funds are withdrawn.\n\nAlternatively, blocking software can be downloaded, prohibiting access to online gambling.\n\nLand-Based Operators – Unified Self-Barring System \n\nThe self-barring system prevents players from gambling, by blocking access to land-based gaming facilities such as casinos, gaming parlours, bingo halls etc. Whilst licensed operators are obliged to offer players the ability to opt for self-barring, there is an equal obligation on players not to attempt to bypass the system. To register on the self-barring system, players can directly contact the Malta Gaming Authority or the Responsible Gaming Foundation for assistance with the process. Moreover, a player can also apply for a self-barring from all land-based gaming premises. A form must be completed and a copy of your ID card is to be provided.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

This committee decides which entities and personnel should be screened, when to conduct enhanced due diligence, and whether or not existent licensees should continue to conduct gaming business under the Malta licence.\n\nIt is also tasked with recommending changes in the policies and procedures regarding the fit and properness of operators and individuals, recommend enforcement actions where it deems necessary and also turn down approval requests. The Fit and Proper Committee also evaluates and determines any changes in the risk assessment of licensed operators and may impose licence conditions at its own discretion.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"
