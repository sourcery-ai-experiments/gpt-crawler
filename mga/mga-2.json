In fact, traffic on Malta’s stand was higher than that experienced in previous years.\n\nJoseph Cuschieri, Executive Chairman of the MGA said that this year’s ICE expo was very positive for the Maltese Authority, with a number of existing licensees confirming their plans for growth and expansion in Malta. Furthermore, a high degree of interest was registered by potential new licensees in establishing their presence in Malta to serve markets in Europe and beyond. The new gaming legislation which should be enacted later this year and the changing regulatory landscape in Europe was of particular interest to the industry. “This is very encouraging for both Malta and the MGA”, said Mr. Cuschieri. “It gives us the motivation and resolve to continue delivering on our strategic plans to make Malta the Silicon Valley of gaming and a global centre of excellence”, he continued.\n\nAt this year’s expo, the MGA participated with a team of 12 officials with disciplines ranging from Legal, International Affairs, Compliance and Authorisations together with members of the MGA’s senior leadership team.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The original consultation document and feedback received can be accessed on the MGA’s website on the Consultations Page.\n\nThe purpose of these Guidelines (which can be accessed below), is to update the MGA’s approach when implementing its regulatory requirements and procedures with respect to Technical Infrastructure. They are intended to guide operators, licensees, service providers and stakeholders on the MGA’s compliance objectives when evaluating an applicant’s or licensee’s technical set-up.\n\nThe approach adopted by the MGA in attaining its regulatory objectives is based on these Guidelines which are intended to provide the necessary flexibility for operators to exploit the benefits of technology, including cloud solutions while ensuring adequate supervision over an operator’s gaming and control systems, to safeguard the players and the MGA’s regulatory interests. The approach focuses on the utilisation of a technological environment which has the required level of security and data integrity allowing the MGA to have timely access to all the regulatory data in order to ensure that it remains well positioned to conduct its supervisory functions, at pre and post licensing stages including the possibility to carry out regular inspections, auditing and/or ad-hoc investigations.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Consumers are faced with a wide array of options in terms of operators and games across different mediums. Players can choose anything from slot machines in one of the casinos, online sports-betting to a traditional bingo. Attracting consumers is an important consideration for gaming operators, whether it is through traditional or digital means of advertising, or via inducements and bonuses. In light of this, the proper regulation of advertising of gaming services is of paramount importance.\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) is of the view that the current rules on the advertising of gaming services need to be updated to better reflect the sector’s development, in terms of player behaviour, marketing techniques, new technologies, regulatory practice, and the needs of society in general. To this effect, the Authority is hereby publishing the draft Code of Commercial Communications for public consultation and feedback.\n\nThe general aim of the proposed Code is the protection of minors and other individuals who are, or may be more susceptible to problem gambling, the promotion and safeguarding of players’ rights and responsible gaming, the elimination of misleading terms, and in general the fair and non-predatory treatment of consumers by gaming operators.\n\nQueries and requests for clarifications with respect to the content of the document, as well as contributions/feedback from interested parties may be sent to [email protected]\n\nClosing date for feedback on the aforementioned consultation is Monday, 28 March 2016.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

This represents a 14.5% increase over what was registered during the same period in 2014. This indicates that the remote gaming industry in Malta has continued to grow. The report also provides more detailed information about land-based activities through casinos, gaming parlours, commercial bingo halls and the national lotteries.\n\nThe MGA will publish a full year industry performance report in May 2016 when it issues its Annual Report for the financial year ending Dec 2015.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The representatives present then proceeded to signing the cooperation arrangement as a sign of endorsement. Dr Edwina Licari, Chief Officer – Legal & EU/International Affairs represented the MGA on the panel and signed the agreement on Malta’s behalf.\n\nThe MGA’s Executive Chairman Joseph Cuschieri welcomed today’s signing of the administrative cooperation arrangement (see link) with other EU/EEA gambling authorities during today’s special meeting held in Brussels and augurs that this shall be a stepping stone towards constructive information sharing, alignment and embracing of innovation while adopting a best practice approach towards regulation. “This agreement is a result of various discussions and debates between the various national gaming authorities and credit goes to the officials working in DG-GROW as well as to the representative officials of the various regulatory bodies who collectively worked towards this significant multilateral achievement.”\n\nThis agreement aims to institutionalise and structure the ongoing cooperation between the competent authorities of EU/EEA member states relating to the exchange of information and best practices, as well as to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens in gaming related matters. The MGA believes that in order to achieve results, clear objectives need to be set in order to keep up with this dynamic and fast moving industry. The MGA hopes that such an agreement would facilitate communication in order to embrace the subject of online gambling services objectively, as a regulated offer irrespective of the country of consumption or supply. The message transmitted through such cooperation and the value that may ensue is the link between independent authorities all working towards the same objectives within the respective political and governmental ambits albeit diverse legal and regulatory gaming frameworks.\n\nFor further information, see below:\n\nTowards a comprehensive European framework for online gambling\nExpert group on gambling services\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The consultation document and feedback received can be accessed on the MGA’s website through the following link.\n\nThe position paper, (which can be accessed below), seeks to clarify the Authority’s stand and approach with respect to the several different types of games available on the market which may include elements of skill, as well as detailing the Authority’s regulatory policy into the proposed overhaul of gaming legislation in Malta.\n\nWith respect to the regulatory policy concerning skill games in the short and medium term, and within the context of the regulatory overhaul underway, the Authority is of the opinion that skill games (with prize) with no, or a negligible element of chance should not be subjected to licensing requirements, since the risks associated with these games do not warrant such stringent ex-ante requirements. However, skill game operators and their gaming activities should fall under the governance and regulatory competence of the Authority and be subject to certain standards and monitoring to ensure a safe and fair environment for consumers. On the other hand, for games the outcome of which is mainly accidental but also influenced significantly by the skill of the player, and which are licensable under the present gaming framework, are also identified. The position is that such games should still be subject to a licensing requirement, but the requirements imposed should reflect the risk posed by such operation, and as such must be distinguished from those of games of chance. Regulatory intervention should not go beyond what is necessary to ensure a safe and fair environment for consumers, free from criminal activity.\n\nThe Authority therefore considers that the new regulatory framework should reflect the principles set out in this position paper, and will make proposals to this effect to Government. The Authority shall continue to monitor developments in this gaming segment and will review its position as necessary in the future.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The report looks at the performance of the MGA, highlighting major projects undertaken throughout the same period. The report also includes a section highlighting the key performance indicators for the first half of 2020 as well as a medium-term outlook into the future, followed by a detailed report explaining key statistics for the land-based and online gaming sectors in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe following are the key highlights from the Interim Report:\n\nDuring the first six months of 2020, the MGA and the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) signed an updated version of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which brought forth better co-operative instruments for the supervision of Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) in the gaming sector;\nIn order to raise awareness on AML/CFT, during the first half of 2020 the MGA organised a training session for the industry by means of a webinar. This focused mainly on common AML/CFT shortcomings, the emerging money laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF) threats, and typologies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and Digital ID methods, including a question-and-answers session with FIAU representatives;\nThe MGA’s Fit & Proper Committee held 20 meetings throughout the first six months of 2020 with a total of 132 decisions taken. The Committee issued a total of five refusals of individuals and companies, due to them being assessed as not fit and proper on the basis of mitigating the risks of ML/TF. Furthermore, the Committee issued 35 conditional verdicts whereby further information and/or documentation was required to proceed with the final decision. The remaining decisions taken during the first six months of 2020 were pertinent to procedural matters in light of the limitations imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\nDuring the period under review, a Consultation Paper on Suspicious Betting Reporting Requirements & Other Sports Integrity Measures was published in preparation for the implementation of the Suspicious Betting Reporting Requirements which will oblige Business-to-Consumer licensees offering betting on sporting events to inform the Authority of any instance of suspicious betting;\nRecognising the importance of establishing data-sharing agreements with relevant stakeholders, including sport governing bodies and other platforms whose function includes the detection of suspicious betting activities, the MGA signed a total of four agreements, namely a data-sharing agreement with the International Cricket Council, the Swedish Football Association, the Darts Regulation Authority and the World Professional Billiards & Snooker Association;\nBetween January and June 2020, the Commercial Communication Committee of the MGA has taken action against 10 adverts or promotions that, in the opinion of the Committee, inappropriately exploited the COVID-19 pandemic;\nBetween January and June 2020, following information which emerged from compliance audits, compliance reviews, and formal investigations, the Authority issued 11 warnings, suspended two licences, and cancelled another seven. In addition, the MGA issued a total of nine administrative fines;\nThe Authority has received 40 international co-operation requests and has sent 25 such requests. These covered various areas, including sports integrity, criminal activity by players, adverse media reports, locally licensed operators and entities not holding a licence, as well as the Authority’s authorisation process and the regulatory regime;\nIn order to facilitate the on-going close communication between authorities and the effective sharing of information, the Authority entered into an MoU with the Malta Business Registry;\nIn its efforts to boost knowledge sharing and co-operation with international counterparts, the MGA has hosted a delegation of members of the Lotteries and Gaming Board and the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage of the Republic of Zimbabwe;\nDuring the period under review, a total of 833 criminal probity screening tests were carried out, covering both land-based and remote gaming activities; and\nDuring the first six months of 2020 the Player Support Unit received a total of 2,431 requests for assistance and resolved 2,433 queries (with the latter covering some requests which were still pending at the end of 2019). The COVID-19 pandemic has affected players differently and as a result a 38% increase year-on-year was registered in the number of requests received during this period.\n\nThe MGA will publish a full-year industry performance report in May 2021 when it publishes its Annual Report for the financial year ending 31 December 2020.\n\n \n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Indeed, a National Helpline was set up to provide support and guidance  to those individuals, family members or significant other who are experiencing any problems related to gambling.  Individuals in need can contact the Helpline either through its freephone 1777 or through a chat facility which can be easily accessed through the Responsible Gaming Foundation’s website www.rgf.org.mt. Callers can choose to remain anonymous and any obtained information will be treated confidential.\n\n“Everyone knows the importance of the gaming industry in Malta, and this is why we should continue to help it grow and be stronger, however this cannot be done without help for those who fall into the gambling addiction,” said the Malta Gaming Authority’s (MGA) Chief Officer – Operations, Heathcliff Farrugia. “One of the main reasons for the inception of the Foundation was the introduction of this call centre so as to cater for gambling problems”, added Mr Farrugia.\n\nParliamentary Secretary for Competitiveness and Economic Growth, Hon. Jose` Herrera underlined the significant bearing that the gaming industry has on our economic growth. Hon. Herrera acknowledged the excellent work which the Malta Gaming Authority is doing in this regard, whilst also praised the Responsible Gaming Foundation for its involvement to promote responsible use of gaming. Nevertheless, Hon. Herrera added that one has to cater also for those individuals who are unable to perceive gambling as a recreational activity because of their loss of control. In fact, the main aim of the Helpline 1777 is to help individuals and their families who are experiencing any problems related to problematic gambling/dependency.\n\nThe Parliamentary Secretary added that professional help is necessary when the gambler’s main priorities in life revolve around gambling activities only. Indeed, the main aim of the Helpline 1777 is to support these individuals and their families in their afflictions and other life difficulties that may arise from this behavioural dependency.  Till the present date, there is no statistics which can shed light on the extent of such a problem.  “Statistics from MGA only indicates that in 2014, the rate of people who made use of the self-barring service increased to 1,043 persons when compared to the 970 individuals in 2013.”\n\nThe chairperson of the RGF, Hon. Silvio Schembri stated that gaming is a well-integrated concept in our Maltese culture and greater effort should be made in educating our citizens to pursuit gambling for recreational purposes only.  Yet, once a person forms a dependency, the individual can never become a responsible gambler.  “The Foundation is operating this Helpline as in Malta as to date there is not yet a helpline which specifically supports this vulnerable group in need of support and guidance.”  Hon. Silvio Schembri emphasised that the Helpline 1777 will also support the gambler’s family members and significant others as they too experience various negative repercussions. MP. Silvio Schembri underlined the fact that this is a social problem and that it is our responsibility to help these people instead of   “ignoring or excluding them.”\n\nMs. Lorraine Mifsud, Call Centre Manager explained in further details the aims of this innovative service. She described gambling dependency as a disease “which brings along other life difficulties such as mental health problems, psychological, physical and also social problems.” In the near future, Helpline 1777 will also be available 24/7 for the general public to assist them in their difficulties.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The underlying objective is to continue steering Malta to be the absolute leader, fostering innovation, development and thought leadership in distinct areas of the sector’s governance.  These areas include the overall integrity of the sector, enhanced player protection and regulatory compliance performance.\n\nThe MGA’s objective is to consult publicly on issues which are industry relevant and have a potential impact on operators. As such, the MGA wishes to involve all potentially impacted stakeholders in its consultation processes to obtain their views and perspectives on the possible impact of changes in technology and/or operational requirements for enhanced compliance reporting.\n\nIn this regard, the MGA is looking into the adoption of enhanced reporting tool for Land Based Gaming Devices, primarily through the means of the implementation of an automated enhanced reporting platform. The MGA’s aim is to continue to improve on compliance reporting, leveraging technology to further drive benefits to the industry in general and the operators in particular, in order to reach its goals of improved future stability, integrity and consumer protection. The Consultation on Enhanced Automated Reporting Platform (EARP) for Land Based Gaming Devices in Casinos and Gaming Parlours can be viewed here.\n\nFurthermore, the MGA is evaluating the adoption of an Enhanced Automated Reporting Platform for the remote gaming sector. This is due to the fact that some operators are choosing to locate part of their technical infrastructure in locations other than Malta which may hinder the timely and effective reporting capability by the MGA. The Consultation on Enhanced Automated Reporting Platform for Online / Remote Gaming can be accessed through here.\n\nQueries and requests for clarifications with respect to the contents of both aforementioned documents, as well as contributions/feedback from interested parties may be sent to [email protected]\n\nClosing date for both consultations is Wednesday, 16 December 2015 at 16:00h.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The IAGR consists of representatives from gaming regulatory organisations throughout the world and its aim is to advance the effectiveness and efficiency of gaming regulation, by fostering co-operation between gaming regulators. On the other hand, IMGL (The International Masters of Gaming Law) is a non-profit association of gaming attorneys, regulators, educators, executives and consultants from around the world who are dedicated to education and the exchange of professional information and advice. This was the first time that the two organisations held a joint conference with sessions focused on topics relevant to regulators and industry professionals alike.\n\nThis year’s high profile annual event included discussions, networking sessions and panels on various gaming related matters such as match fixing, sports integrity, regulation of remote gambling and joint cooperation between Authorities and the industry amongst other topics. The MGA’s Executive Chairman was one of the panel speakers in the breakout session with his counterparts from UK, Gibraltar, Alderney and Mpumalanga entitled ‘How to Build a Gambling Authority’ chaired by Dr Julian Harris, Senior Partner, Harris Hagan. The panel focused on the challenges of building a reputable gambling authority through effective legislation, robust regulatory frameworks, proper licensing and enforcement processes as well as the importance of regulating the gambling market.\n\nMr Cuschieri said: “This year’s event met the expectations of all participants both in terms of organisation, networking opportunities and content. I would like to congratulate Dr J Hofmann, President of IMGL, Ms Birgitte Sand, President of IAGR and the organising committee for the excellent event”. Mr Cuschieri was accompanied by Dr Rachel Mifsud Bonnici, Chief Officer – Compliance and Dr Edwina Licari, Chief Officer – Legal & EU/International Affairs.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

A wide range of policies are being critically reviewed to amongst other things, continuously raise standards of governance and reinforce the supervisory and compliance monitoring of the industry by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA).\n\nThe MGA’s fit and proper guidelines are one of a series of measures to be launched by the MGA in order to ensure a consistent and transparent approach in its regulatory outreach in the interests of all stakeholders and customers alike.\n\nThese Guidelines set out the minimum criteria applicable to all relevant persons falling under all the activities regulated by the MGA in accordance with applicable law. The MGA’s vision is to ensure that it facilitates effective compliance, reduce administrative burdens and duplication of requirements on the industry without compromising its regulatory ethos. A revamped set of application and reporting guidelines together with updated official application forms shall also be issued in the coming weeks together with other regulatory “quick win” announcements forming part of the MGA’s intensive transformation process referred to in the recently published annual report for 2014.\n\nThe MGA has recognised the necessity to strengthen the requirements which must be met by the person fulfilling the Key Official function. In doing so, the MGA aims to strengthen the compliance capability of the licensee which has become a more critical feature of the MGA’s fit and proper assessment. The Authority’s objective in this area is generally to ensure that an operator has sufficient compliance capability and competence allocated to the right official/s who will in turn enhance the systemic compliance performance of its licensees.\n\nWhile the governance and risk management review and the fit and proper assessment policy framework address all forms of gaming operations and licensees, including land-based, this consultation deals only with the Key Official function of remote gaming operations. Notwithstanding the specificity of this consultation, the MGA is envisaging the adoption of similar requirements for key officials for land-based licensees.\n\nThe Fit and Proper Guidelines can be accessed here, whereas the Consultation on the Key Official fitness and propriety requirements can be viewed here.\n\nAll responses should be sent by email to [email protected] by not later than Friday 16 October 2015.\n\nAlternatively, responses can be sent by post to:\n\nConsultations\nMalta Gaming Authority\nSuite 1, Level 3, TG Complex,\nBrewery Street Mriehel,\nBKR 3000,\nMalta\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Notwithstanding the fact that the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) has long accepted this practice and intends to continue upholding it, it deems a policy on the subject matter is necessary.\n\nFor this reason, the MGA wishes to develop a draft policy in conjunction with the gaming industry for which a Joint Working Group is being set up with members representing the widest possible spectrum of the industry. The aim is to generally introduce the concept as well as the perspective of the MGA on outsourcing in remote gaming. It seeks to set out a number of parameters for a Policy on Outsourcing which the MGA would like to develop and adopt in collaboration with the industry.\n\nThe proposed Joint Working Group shall be composed of 10 members: four (4) from the MGA and six (6) members representing the remote gaming industry. The Group shall elect its Chairperson from amongst its members. Members of the working group may invite senior industry officials or their representative bodies, or other regulator/s, with knowledge/experience in the sector and subject matter being discussed, including stakeholders’ representatives of service providers of outsourced activities. The Working Group may receive such representations and input from other stakeholders in person (through participation/presentation in meetings) or in writing.\n\nThe Joint Working Group will be launched once the nominations are made by the industry (during September 2015) and will remain operational for a period of 12 weeks, by which time it is expected that the Working Group would have adopted a common position on a proposal for a Policy on Outsourcing, with input from other relevant stakeholders. Meetings shall be held physically or using secure teleconference facilities.\n\nFor more information, please send an email to [email protected].\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Vella, welcomed this agreement, saying that knowledge of game theory will equip students with a much-needed skill, namely that of applying mathematical techniques to understanding behaviour and decisions that lead to particular outcomes, not always as intended.\n\n“We have here a very important example of how University training and specialist education facilitate the students’ journey towards their careers and personal success and also assists industry actors, and in this case, the regulator, in finding the human resources required for their development leading, ultimately, to  economic benefits for our society ”, he continued.\n\nThe MGA’s Chief Executive Officer, Carl Brincat stated that, “Promoting the development of Malta as a centre of excellence is among the MGA’s regulatory objectives and collaborating with the University of Malta on initiatives such as this is an invaluable step towards achieving it.”\n\nFurther to the sponsorship of these lectures through the provision of a Visiting Lecturer, the two entities have both committed themselves to more collaborations for the benefit of local students and the gaming industry.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The report provides an overview of the work performed throughout the year and highlights major projects undertaken by the Authority throughout the same period. In addition, the report also outlines the performance of the Maltese gaming industry during 2020 as well as a medium-term outlook into the future, followed by a detailed report explaining key statistics for the land-based and online gaming sectors in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe following are the key highlights from the Annual Report covering the year 2020:\n\nBetween January and December 2020, following information which emerged from compliance audits, compliance reviews, and formal investigations, the Authority issued 69 warnings, suspended 3 licences, and cancelled another 12. In addition, the MGA issued a total of 24 administrative penalties.\nIn 2020, 30 compliance audits were conducted by the Compliance and AML function, one of which related to a live studio, and 324 desktop reviews were carried out, of which 98 identified deficiencies which were accordingly escalated to the Compliance and Enforcement Committee.\nIn 2020, 8 individuals and companies were deemed not to be up to the Authority’s probity standards by the Fit & Proper Committee, mainly on the basis of mitigating the risks of money laundering or funding of terrorism.\nDuring the twelve-month period of 2020, a total of 1,475 criminal probity screening checks were undertaken, an increase of 13.5% when compared to the year 2019.\nIn terms of AML/CFT, during the twelve-month period of 2020, a total of 27 supervisory examinations on online gaming licensees were conducted by the MGA, of which 10 were full scope examinations, 3 were targeted examinations, 8 were thematic examinations, and 6 were supervisory meetings.\nIn 2020, the MGA conducted a total of 65 interviews with prospective MLROs and key persons carrying out the AML/CFT function to determine the knowledge and suitability of each candidate, out of which 40 were approved, 17 were conditionally approved and 8 were rejected.\nThe Commercial Communication Committee of the MGA took action against 10 adverts or promotions that, in the opinion of the Committee, inappropriately exploited the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring 2020 the Player Support Unit received a total of 5,625 requests for assistance, a 58% increase over 2019, potentially stemming at least partly from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on player behaviour.\nIn its efforts to boost knowledge sharing and cooperation with international counterparts, the MGA hosted a delegation of members of the Lotteries and Gaming Board and the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage of the Republic of Zimbabwe.\nThe Authority received 67 international cooperation requests from other regulators and sent 47 such requests, with the majority referring to requests for background checks as part of an authorisation process.\nDuring the year 2020, a total of 168 requests for information specifically relating to the manipulation of sports competitions or breaches in sports rules were submitted by enforcement agencies, sport governing bodies, integrity units, and other regulatory bodies. Additionally, a total of 288 suspicious betting reports from licensees and other concerned parties were received.\nDuring the period under review, the Authority was a direct participant in 20 different investigations across the globe relating to manipulation of sports competitions or breaches in sports rules.\nRecognising the importance of establishing data sharing agreements with relevant stakeholders, including sport governing bodies and other platforms whose function includes the detection of suspicious betting activities, the MGA signed a total of five agreements, namely a data sharing agreement with the International Cricket Council, the Swedish Football Association, the Darts Regulation Authority, the World Professional Billiards & Snooker Association, and the Slovak Football Association.\nDuring 2020, the MGA and the FIAU signed an updated version of the MoU which brought forth better cooperative instruments for the supervision of AML/CFT in the gaming sector.\nThe Authority entered into an MoU with the Malta Business Registry with the aim of facilitating the ongoing close communication between authorities and the effective sharing of information.\nWith the aim of increasing cooperation with our international counterparts, an MoU was agreed to by the MGA and the Dutch Kansspelautoriteit (the Dutch Gambling Authority) on the basis that the two authorities will support each other by sharing best practices and information in support of their responsibilities at law, whilst also engaging in discussions on policy matters of interest.\nThe MGA also enhanced its collaboration with the Commissioner for Voluntary Organisations by creating a process whereby any entity that applies for a non-profit game is only issued with a permit if such an entity is a registered and compliant voluntary organisation.\nRecognising the importance of regular dialogue with stakeholders, throughout 2020, over 55 external communications were sent, providing a synopsis of various updates and developments within the Authority and industry.\n\nIn publishing this report, the CEO, Dr Carl Brincat said: “The year 2020 will undoubtedly be remembered for the challenges the pandemic presented us with, and I am proud of the Authority’s employees who worked tirelessly to ensure that we continued to perform the functions required of us at law. Keeping the ship steady during a challenging year serves as a strong foundation for us to look ahead with renewed commitment to keep building on the positives and improve on our shortcomings, to reach new heights in our regulatory approach.”\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

We are therefore pleased to have been awarded a Class II Remote Gaming licence by the MGA, following a robust application process which examined our gambling operations, procedures and the experience of our personnel. In conjunction with the Maltese licensing process, we have also now established a Maltese marketing company, with premises located in Sliema, accommodating our marketing management and procurement functions headed by Mr Fred Bjurjfall who will be supporting the marketing activities of the Group”.\n\n“The Malta Gaming Authority is delighted to have bet365 included in its portfolio of licensees. The Authority is committed to addressing the ongoing evolution of the industry as well as the challenges this brings along with it, with transparency, integrity and focus on consumer protection. The fact that bet365 chose to include Malta as one of its licensing jurisdictions is testimony to our reputation and encourages us to keep raising the bar in innovation and thought leadership on gaming regulation” said Joseph Cuschieri, MGA’s Executive Chairman.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The reason that Malta had submitted the Request for Opinion was to obtain an opinion on whether the definition of “illegal sports betting” was consistent with the objectives of the Treaty, including its scope.\n\nMalta’s position on the Convention has always been made very clear and remains unchanged. Malta has maintained that it fully supports the main objective of the Convention which is to prevent the manipulation of sports competitions. In fact, Malta is currently undergoing an exercise to ensure the implementation of stricter rules and systems to suppress fraud and manipulation in sports. However, Malta has consistently reiterated its concerns on the definition of ‘illegal sports betting’ which goes beyond the scope of the Convention and does not contribute to the fight against match fixing. Malta tabled various proposals for amendment throughout the discussions on the Convention and following the rejection of all such proposals, was compelled to vote against its adoption. Consequently, Malta did not sign the Convention when it was opened for signature in September 2014.\n\nNotwithstanding the submission of the Request for an Opinion in July 2014, a legislative proposal for the Union to proceed was proposed and is now being discussed in Council. Given the developing circumstances, and after examining the legislative proposal, Malta considers that other solutions may be available to it and has decided that, at this stage, it is more appropriate to try to achieve an acceptable state of affairs for Malta through deeper dialogue at the European level, without however renouncing to any of Malta’s rights and prerogatives. For these reasons, Malta will continue to hold discussions at the highest levels within the EU to safeguard this position during the following months.\n\nCredit – DOI – http://www.gov.mt/en/Government/Press%20Releases/Pages/2015/August/18/pr151852.aspx\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

At the time of application (according to the MGA’s records), in line with standard procedures, all directors, shareholders, senior managers and ultimate beneficiary owners of these companies have been screened through MGA’s systems and protocols, using probity tools and national and international contacts and organisations. This forms part of the probity checks conducted at pre-licensing stage and before the actual business model of the gaming operation in question is screened and other control systems are checked and approved. The licensing process also includes independent audits, such as system and compliance audits which are carried out by approved external auditors.\n\nThe companies in question were registered with offices in Malta. They were licensed under the Remote Gaming Regulations to provide online betting and casino type games in and from Malta. According to their business model the online offer/services were distributed to players and facilitated through a number of online and land-based channels.\n\nIt is pertinent to point out that an MGA licence does not relieve the licensee from fulfilling their obligations under the licence irrespective of where the service is provided, or from any other regulatory requirements which may be applicable in the jurisdiction where the service is actually provided [such as the holding of a licence to operate betting shops]. In this particular case, it was the Italian authorities who took action and the Maltese authorities cooperated in full on the basis of the alleged money laundering.\n\nFurthermore, the Maltese authorities and the MGA are taking these money laundering allegations very seriously and are taking all necessary measures to protect the integrity of the Maltese jurisdiction and its gaming regulatory regime.\n\nREGULATORY ETHOS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nSome gaming activities, or rather, business models, may have a higher risk profile than others as much as certain individuals involved in an operation could carry higher risks and tarnish an otherwise legitimate operation. As an experienced online gaming regulator, it is our duty to minimise those risks as much as possible and put in place a detailed risk management policy to manage risk in every facet of the MGA’s activities. But as any regulator can vouch, it is unreasonable to expect that the legislation, mechanisms, protocols and control tools at hand provide for a 100% watertight controlled environment at any given time even though that remains our prime objective.\n\nBoth the legislation and our administrative systems and controls are constantly under review precisely in order to sharpen our processes to effectively mitigate new and emerging risks hence strengthening the hand of the regulator and enhance the control environment. This also involves investment in sophisticated technologies and business intelligence tools to enhance monitoring and compliance capabilities. Our focus remains on the enhancement of player protection and integrity of both games and the jurisdiction.\n\nReputational risk is critical for the long term sustainability of the gaming sector in Malta. This is ingrained in everything that we do. In delivering its functions and responsibilities, the MGA ensures that assessment of risk is led by evidence and best regulatory practice. Where there is no evidence, one takes a cautious approach. The MGA is responsible at law to ensure that gaming, in all its forms and through all channels, is fair and remains free from crime and fraud. In this respect, the MGA took immediate action to suspend the operations concerned.\n\nWhile the MGA considers these allegations as unique to these operators, the MGA will strongly enforce its rules and regulations to sustain its reputation and will aggressively bring in further measures to combat this type of licence violation.\n\nThe MGA’s player support service line is open to assist any players who are concerned about the status of their accounts. Player protection is our primary concern at the MGA and we will take all steps to assure that customers of Uniq Group Ltd and Betsolutions4U Ltd receive all their funds.\n\nFor more information please visit the MGA’s website at mgaorgmt.kinsta.cloud.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

José Herrera, Parliamentary Secretary for Competitiveness and Economic Growth and Mr Joseph Cuschieri, Executive Chairman of the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) at the Mistral Suite and Terrace at the Marina Hotel Corinthia Beach resort.\n\nThe MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri\n\nThis year’s MiGs will be held at the Corinthia Hotel, St. Julian’s between the 16th and 19th of November.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of MiGS, Jeffrey Buttigieg, Director of MiGS and COO of RE/MAX Malta, thanked all attendees and collaborators for providing their support to the event. “Founded in 2008, today MiGs has become globally recognized as a must-attend conference on the iGaming Calendar.  Over the last two years, the event has seen a transformation and has matured into a top-ten event, as quoted by Calvinayre.com, a major iGaming online portal. Last year, the event was especially successful as we attracted over 450 delegates to MIGS14 and we started seeing the fruit of our labour during the previous five years,” Mr Buttigieg stated.\n\nOne of the highlights of the upcoming event in November – in line with the conference theme, “Past, Present and Future of iGaming” – will be hosting a panel that will include four remarkable pioneers of the industry that have a combined experience of over 100 years.  The event will also expound on a number of ensuing topics, including the latest EU directives, emerging jurisdictions, payments, advocacy as well as subjects of potential growth including Mobile gaming, eSports and others.\n\nMr Joseph Cuschieri, Executive Chairman of MGA, said that the Authority has supported MiGS from its humble beginnings, and congratulated the organisers for bringing together so many people for this launch.  He said that this proves that MiGS has a strong backing as he encouraged individuals to attend.\n\nHe added: “MiGS has not only played an important role in promoting the Malta Gaming industry over the years, but has also placed the country on the international gaming map, as a destination to attend a top level iGaming conference that attracts international executives.”\n\nHon. José Herrera, Parliamentary Secretary for Competitiveness and Economic Growth stated: “I am honoured to be able speak at the launch of such an entrepreneurial initiative from the private sector. The Malta iGaming Seminar is a must-attend event and I’d like to thank the organisers for doing Malta proud.”\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The process proved to be effective, providing the MGA with the appropriate mechanism to approve independent and competent Service Providers as well as remove or suspend providers in case of unsatisfactory performance. The Authority has recently reviewed the requirements applicable to audit services to ensure that they remain up to date in view of the ongoing developments in the sector and in line with the MGA’s expectations.\n\nIn view of the Authority’s commitment to an open and transparent decision-making process, the MGA is issuing this consultation paper to communicate and refine its proposal in relation to revised Guidelines and promote a greater understanding of the proposal itself. The consultation, which will run until 17 December 2021, seeks feedback from the industry in relation to:\n\nthe amendments introduced in the Guidelines (as listed in Section 3 of the Consultation document); and\nthe extension of the applicability of the Guidelines to statutory audits carried out in accordance with international financial reporting standards as required by Article 41(2) of the Gaming Authorisations and Compliance Directive (Directive 3 of 2018).\n\nFollowing the consultation process, the Authority intends to publish its decision, including the final version of the Guidelines and any other supporting documents, by the end of the year 2021.\n\nAny queries and requests for clarifications that contributors may have in respect of the contents of the consultation paper and feedback from the interested parties shall be sent to the following email address: [email protected].\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Licensees are required to ensure that:\n\nthe statutory financial statements are audited in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, and prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU. In addition, for B2C licensees providing gaming services by remote means, the financial statements should disclose the Player Funds Account Balance separately under the Cash and Cash Equivalents Note within the audited statutory financial statements as well as disclose player funds under the Trade and Other Payables Note to the audited statutory financial statements;\nan Agreed-Upon Procedures Report drawn up in accordance with ISRS 4400 (Revised) Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagements in relation to the Gaming Tax and the Gaming Licence Fees applicable to the licensees which fall under the Maltese licence is submitted to the MGA; and\nin the case of B2C licensees providing gaming services by remote means, an Agreed-Upon Procedures Report drawn up in accordance with ISRS 4400 (Revised) Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagements in relation to the player funds, the jackpot funds, as well as the portion of Player Funds Account balance held by the licensees which fall under the Maltese licence, is submitted to the MGA.\n\nThe ISRS 4400 reports provided in terms of sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii) above shall be provided in the form of separate reports signed by the practitioner. The ISRS 4400 reports submitted by the licensee in terms of sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii) above are distinct from the statutory auditor’s report and are thus subject to separate terms of engagement.\n\nThe said ISRS 4400 reports shall be submitted to the Authority together with the audited statutory financial statements within one hundred and eighty (180) days from the end of the company’s financial year. By way of exception, the MGA will accept that the first round of ISRS 4400 reports, which are required to be submitted for the financial year ending 31 December 2021 and which should be submitted by 30 June 2022, may, instead, be submitted by 31 October 2022 to allow sufficient time for the licensees and practitioners to adjust to these new requirements.\n\nIn order to provide clarity on the professional requirements in the carrying out of the engagements intended to procure the ISRS 4400 reports required in terms of the Directive and to provide guidance on the agreed-upon procedures to be performed in accordance with the International Standard on Related Services (ISRS) 4400 (Revised), the Malta Institute of Accountants Gaming Committee in collaboration with the MGA issued the below Technical Releases laying down the professional requirements for the carrying out of these engagements:\n\nTechnical Release Audit 02/21 – Gaming Tax Payable and Levy on Gaming Devices\nTechnical Release Audit 02/21 – Player Funds and Jackpot Funds\n\nAny queries on the above requirements shall be sent to the Authority on the following email address: [email protected].\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

She will remain in office until February 2022 and will continue to fulfil functions that the MGA’s management consider to not give rise to any real or apparent conflict of interest; specifically, she will not be performing any regulatory, inspectorate, or enforcement duties. With immediate effect, she no longer forms part of any internal committees.\n\nThe MGA would like to thank Yanica for her sterling work over the last seven and a half years, and her invaluable contributions at all levels of the Authority’s hierarchy and to most high-level projects over that time, including notably the drafting of the regulatory framework which was published in 2018. We wish her the best of luck in her new endeavour, confident that she will continue to demonstrate the values which the MGA proudly upholds.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

It also started a programme of investment in IT systems and business intelligence. He also highlighted the objectives for the upcoming three years; that is to ensure high levels of integrity, efficiency, consumer protection, governance and value in gaming products.\n\nMr Cuschieri said that two thirds of the people who are employed in the gaming industry are foreigners, hence the need for more incentives for young Maltese professionals to join the gaming industry. In this respect, a new gaming academy will be launched later on this year, which should become fully operational in two years. The Authority is also aiming for more collaboration with other European regulators to facilitate licensing procedures and streamlining of technical standards. He added that new markets, quality and innovation should remain key priorities for the MGA. He concluded by saying that Malta can be a thought leader in the regulation of gaming and be a catalyst for change and reforms in the sector.\n\nDuring his speech, Parliamentary Secretary Hon. Dr. José Herrera said that the gaming authority is employing more qualified people coupled with more investment in training and development. He said that in this industry, efficiency and effectiveness is crucial. He added that the gaming industry is an important contributor to the country’s economic growth and development. Hon. Herrera stressed on the need to update regulatory legislation to cater for future challenges and dynamics.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Internally, we are reviewing and restructuring the organisation and all our internal processes to become more agile and proactive in the way we carry out our business,” said the Executive Chairman of the Malta Gaming Authority, Joseph Cuschieri. He also stressed that Malta is a role model for other countries due to its experience, diligence and transparency in regulating remote gaming.  Mr Cuschieri added that he was pleased to report that the gaming industry in Malta has had another successful year with substantial year on year growth in its portfolio of regulated companies.\n\nThe MGA’s 2014 annual report provides a detailed overview of the salient developments during the year under review. Throughout 2014, the Authority’s efforts were dedicated to developing more active and co-operative bilateral relations with other regulatory authorities, corporate rebranding and broad stakeholder engagement. The most important project initiated in 2014, led by the MGA’s legal team, was the review and total overhaul of Malta’s legal and regulatory gaming framework and attendant implementation mechanisms. This should lead to the presentation of draft proposals for Government, aimed at consolidating all legislation under a single framework providing for a consistent, technology-neutral, evidence-based and forward-looking governance of all gaming sectors in Malta.\n\nThe Authority in 2014 increased its resource infrastructure mainly to strengthen its enforcement, compliance, player protection and legal functions but also included investments in ICT and business intelligence. For the period 2015 – 2017, the MGA’s strategic plan aims to ensure a high level of integrity, efficiency, consumer protection and value in all gaming products and services across all supply channels. The Authority’s vision is translated into three mutually reinforcing objectives which are:\n\nQuality, integrity and consumer protection,\nImplementation of a responsive regulatory framework; and\nProactively looking and identifying new potential markets.\n\nThe Authority is facing its future challenges with optimism in order to lead in its core regulatory functions and become the jurisdiction of choice and the global centre of excellence in the remote gaming industry.\n\nThe 2014 Annual Report may be downloaded from HERE or a copy may be requested from the Authority.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The conference will be held at the Corinthia Hotel, St. George’s Bay, between 16th and the 19th November.\n\nThe event has now become one of the most important events in the calendar of events of the gaming industry. Last year, the conference attracted over 400 delegates, 65% of whom travelled from mainland Europe, America, Asia and the Middle East. MIGS today is renowned for bringing together the best from the industry to contribute to the high profile discussions and presentations.\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority, which is the regulatory body responsible for the governance of all gaming activities in Malta, has been the main supporter of the conference from the very beginning since 2008. Speaking of their continued support, Joseph Cuschieri, Executive Chairman of the Malta Gaming Authority said, “MIGS has not only played an important role in promoting the Malta Gaming industry over the years but has also placed the country on the international  gaming map, as a destination to attend a top level iGaming conference that attracts international executives. We proudly look forward to supporting MIGS for yet another year, in Nov 2015.”\n\nMiGS 2015 promises to be one of the most informative and interactive conferences of its kind. The programme, which has already attracted several international high profile speakers, will keep those interested in this global industry abreast with international topics and latest trends.\n\nThe conference is also an ideal opportunity for executives to understand the potential of obtaining a gaming license in Malta, a credible jurisdiction better known as Europe’s iGaming Capital. Ms. Sue Schneider, Partner of MIGS Limited, said, “It is with great enthusiasm that we announce that the Malta Gaming Authority has confirmed that it will support MIGS 2015. Without MGA’s continued support over the last seven years, we would not be able to offer such a quality event.”\n\nFor more information go to www.maltaigamingseminar.com\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

This year’s meeting was attended by participants from 23 EU countries including Malta.\n\nThe MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri, accompanied by Chief Operating Officer, Heathcliff Farrugia and Chief Legal Officer, Dr Edwina Licari, attended the event, during which issues about the challenges being faced by European Gaming Regulators, such as the changes in taxation, responsible gambling and addiction, match fixing, and suspicious activity reporting were discussed. A presentation on EU developments regarding gambling was also delivered by Harrie Temmink (Deputy Head of online and postal unit at DG Internal Market).\n\nFrom Left to Right: MGA’s Chief Legal Officer, Dr Edwina Licari, Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri and Chief Operating Officer, Heathcliff Farrugia\n\nThe objective of this forum is to provide an opportunity where European gaming regulators can network, exchange views and information and discuss policy on gaming matters.\n\nMr Cuschieri added, “It is essential that the Malta Gaming Authority participates in this annual event. It is the ideal forum where European Gaming Regulators come together to discuss challenges related to the Gaming Sector. It further strengthens my belief that European jurisdictions can achieve more if regulators work together. By developing a common way forward, this sector can thrive in a more responsible way.”\n\nThis year the biannual election of the Executive Board of GREF took place and Malta, following Heathcliff Farrugia’s nomination and appointment has for the second time round been selected for membership, with the first dating back to 2001. “We hope to contribute and support GREF to roll out its annual work programme over the next two years and to maximise its role in achieving regulatory cooperation in Europe,” continued Mr Cuschieri.\n\nDuring the event Mr Cuschieri presented a short video showcasing Malta, being the selected host country for the next annual GREF meeting taking place in 2016.\n\nThe MGA formally thanks the GREF Executive Board as well as the Gaming Control Authority (GCA) of Lithuania for organising such a successful event.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

This year’s meeting was attended by participants from all over the US together with a number of European sector professionals.\n\nThe MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri attended the event, having been invited as one of the distinguished speakers for the session entitled ‘Through the eyes of the pioneers: Top iGaming Tips from the Europeans’ which was moderated by Nick Nocton (Director, Jeffrey Green Russell Limited).\n\nIn his intervention, Mr Cuschieri stated that “It is important that the Malta Gaming Authority opens up to the US inter-state gaming regulatory approach to retain a horizontal gaming market outlook outside the EU, with the aim of achieving alignment in relevant areas of common interest for the gaming sector to flourish responsibly and effectively within and outside the EU market.  It is one of the right fora to share regulatory experiences across the continent and listen to operators’ operational outlook within a diverging gaming regulatory environment. The US brick and mortar debate vs. the online providers, certainly unveils sensitive arguments worth considering from a local regulatory front, to achieve the desired regulatory balance between online and land based operations, particularly within the backdrop of an ongoing technological converging gaming market.”\n\nDuring the event Mr Cuschieri outlined his ideas on Malta’s future role in the gaming sphere together with upcoming developments from a regulatory front. He emphasised the need for closer bilateral relationships between European regulators to streamline technical standards and interoperability so that compliance is simplified. This forum was a platform for various relevant discussions dealing with the emergence of digital gaming and regulation, market outlook on the US as well as scrutiny of the economics underpinning the iGaming industry generally amongst other topics.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Crystal’s lavish onboard casinos on Crystal Serenity are elegantly stylish venues offering gaming and glittering excitement.  Thrilling games of Blackjack, Craps, Roulette, 3 Card Poker™, Ultimate Texas Hold’em™ and Mini-Baccarat (on request), as well as slot and video poker machines are available.\n\n“Valletta Cruise Port welcomes this first application, following our instigation to introduce this legislation. This legislation makes Malta a more attractive proposition to cruise liners particularly those cruise liners that opt to call at Malta or Gozo for an overnight stay. This is undoubtedly an incentive to encourage cruise liners to overnight in Malta or Gozo, and include both islands in their Mediterranean itinerary.  Valletta Cruise Port has been promoting these regulations, and feedback from other cruise lines has been positive”, commented Stephen Xuereb, Valletta Cruise Port’s Chief Executive Officer.\n\n“The Authority is committed to safeguard both the interests of passengers on board cruise ships, as well as those of the Maltese gaming industry. The regulations issued by the MGA mean that cruise ships will be able to operate their casinos in-line with the stipulated conditions whilst berthed within Maltese territorial waters,” said the MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri.\n\nParliamentary Secretary Hon. Dr. José Herrera said, “This is indeed very good and exciting news, which augurs well for the future. These new regulations were the result of direct consultation with the relevant stakeholders.” Dr. Herrera hailed both the MGA and Valletta Cruise Port for their commitment to increase the gaming and cruise industries.\n\nThe MGA launched its Cruise Casino Regulations in April 2015, wherein cruise liners are now able to operate their onboard casinos solely for registered passengers while berthing in Malta and/or Gozo overnight and within territorial waters. These Regulations are a result of the policy announced by Government last November during the 2015 Budget speech.\n\nThe Regulations lay down that a formal application for this purpose must be submitted to the MGA, which, in turn, issues such approval once it is satisfied that gaming on board the cruise liner casino shall take place in accordance with the fundamental principles established by the Authority. Once approval is granted, cruise liner casinos will be allowed to operate between 6.00pm and 6.00am in line with the conditions stipulated in these new Regulations.\n\nThe MGA has also set up a dedicated page on the website providing all the necessary information and forms related to obtaining the MGA’s approval which can be accessed on the following link.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

These Regulations are a result of the policy announced by Government last November during the 2015 Budget speech. The Regulations aim to regulate casino operations on board cruise ships, which are either berthed in Malta, Gozo or within Maltese territorial waters.\n\nFrom Left to Right: Parliamentary Secretary for Competitiveness and Economic Growth Hon. Dr José Herrera, MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri and Chief Executive Officer of Valletta Cruise Port, Stephen Xuereb at the launch of the Cruise Casino Regulations\n\nThe MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri said that the MGA introduced the Cruise Liner Casino Regulations to ensure that fair play and player protection processes on board cruise ships are in place.\n\n“Through the Cruise Liner Casino Regulations, we will be able to safeguard both the interests of passengers on board cruise ships, as well as those of the Maltese gaming industry. Cruise ships that are issued with the necessary approval by the MGA will be able to operate their casinos in line with the stipulated conditions whilst berthed here,” added Mr Cuschieri.\n\n“Valletta Cruise Port welcomes the publication of the new casino regulations, following our instigation of the process in recent years. These regulations make Malta a more attractive proposition for cruise liners particularly those who do opt to call at Malta for an overnight stay. This is undoubtedly an incentive to encourage cruise liners to include both Malta and Gozo in their Mediterranean itinerary.  Valletta Cruise Port has already starting promoting these regulations, and feedback from the cruise liner industry has been positive,” commented Stephen Xuereb, Chief Executive Officer of Valletta Cruise Port.\n\nThe Parliamentary Secretary for Competitiveness and Economic Growth Hon. Dr. José Herrera stated that through the introduction of these regulations the Government has taken into consideration the private sector to incentivise these two industries: gaming and the cruise liners. This measure being implemented by the Government was announced during the last budget. As such this secretariat has already accomplished three important propositions from their announcement in the budget: the Authority’s branding, the launch of GamingMalta and the new regulations for the cruise casinos, said Jose’ Herrera.\n\nJosé Herrera praised the Malta Gaming Authority’s commitment that is increasing being pro-active in its efforts to promote job opportunities and investment on our shores.\n\n“Through the implementation of these new regulations, cruise liner operators can apply for approval to operate their onboard casinos. The Authority will be assuring the best principles of fair play and player protection. Therefore the need to regulate arises, to ensure that we build upon the good reputation that our jurisdiction holds,” said the Parliamentary Secretary.\n\nThe government reiterates its commitment to improve these industries to create more quality job opportunities for our country.\n\nThe Regulations lay down that a formal application for this purpose must be submitted to the MGA, which, in turn, issues such approval once it is satisfied that gaming on board the cruise liner casino shall take place in accordance with the fundamental principles established by the Authority. Once approval is granted, cruise liner casinos will be allowed to operate for the duration of their stay, in line with the conditions stipulated in these new regulations. The conditions attached to the approval, stipulate, for instance, that only those persons listed on the passenger manifest of that particular voyage can gamble at the vessel’s casino, and that the casino is only operated during the time window specified in the MGA approval.\n\nThe Cruise Casino Regulations (S.L. 400.03) are being issued under the Gaming Act (Chapter 400 of the Laws of Malta) and are available online through this link.\n\nFor more information on these regulations, one can contact the Authority by calling +356 25469000 or sending an email to [email protected].\n\nA brochure about these regulations has also been issued for guidance purposes, and may be accessed here.\n\nThe Authority has also set up a dedicated page on the website providing all the necessary information and forms related to obtaining the MGA’s approval which can be accessed here.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The event took off with a morning session focused on game monetisation and solutions for the gaming sector, whilst in the afternoon focus shifted towards solutions for IT & Banking.\n\nAddressing those present in his opening speech, Joseph Cuschieri, stressed on the importance of embracing technological advancement, arguing that innovators like Google give policy makers an opportunity to embed the innovation and development trends  into regulation.  He continued by stating that, “Sound regulation should not stifle innovation and growth. On the contrary, they should complement each other. It is not one or the other – it is not a game of thrones!”\n\nThe full version of MGA’s Executive Chairman’s speech can be found here.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The report provides an overview of the Authority’s achievements during the year under review and outlines the performance of the Maltese gaming industry during 2021, coupled with a medium-term outlook into the future. This is also followed by a detailed report explaining key statistics for the land-based and online gaming sectors.\n\n  Supervisory Activities\n\n54 on-site compliance audits were conducted and 230 desktop reviews were carried out, accounting for 65.5% coverage of the licensees base during 2021, accompanied by additional AML/CFT compliance examinations that are carried out by the FIAU, or the MGA on its behalf.Following information which emerged from compliance audits, compliance reviews and formal investigations, the Authority issued 64 warnings and cancelled seven (7) licences.

In total these amounted to just over €863,000.\n13 individuals and companies were deemed not to be up to the Authority’s probity standards by the Fit & Proper Committee, mainly on the basis of mitigating the risks of money laundering or funding of terrorism. An additional three (3) applications were rejected by the Supervisory Council.\nOver 1,150 criminal probity screening checks were undertaken on individuals., shareholders and ultimate beneficial owners, key persons and other employees, and companies from both the land-based and online gaming sectors.\nThe Authority continued with its commitment to supervise its online gaming licensees and conducted 91 interviews with prospective MLROs and key persons carrying out the AML/CFT function to determine the knowledge and suitability of each candidate.\nThe Commercial Communication Committee of the MGA issued a total of 21 letters of Breach, of which 13 operators were found to be in breach of the Commercial Communications Regulations, (S.L. 583.09).\nIn its efforts to protect players and encourage responsible gambling the Authority assisted a total of 6,170 players that requested assistance, covering most of the cases received during 2021 and the spill-over from 2020.\nThe MGA also investigated 79 cases of websites having misleading references to the Authority and published a total of 61 notices on its website with the aim to prevent the public from falling victim to such scams. Furthermore, an additional 26 responsible gambling website checks were conducted.\nA sectoral risk assessment on money laundering and funding of terrorism-related risks affecting the land-based and online gaming sectors in Malta was undertaken.\n\nImprovements in Efficiency and Effectiveness\n\nWith the aim of reducing any unnecessary bureaucracy on its licensees, the Authority has reviewed the Gaming Licence Application Process as well as launched the Personal Portfolio.\nImprovements have been made in the way non-compliance matters are notified to the relevant licensee, and how operators are directed to rectify their position.\nThe MGA published amendments to the ‘Guidance on the use of Innovative Technology Arrangements and the acceptance of Virtual Financial Assets and Virtual Tokens through the implementation of a Sandbox Environment’.\nAmendments to Article 22 of the Player Protection Directive (Directive 2 of 2018) were published, accompanied by a policy paper on ‘Amending the Return to Player Minimum Percentage’. Such amendments aim to streamline the minimum Return to Player percentage applicable to licensees across all sectors.\nA series of amendments to the Gaming Authorisations and Compliance Directive (Directive 3 of 2018) were published, including the extension of the applicability of suspicious betting reporting requirements to B2B licensees as well as broader amendments to the key functions. The latter was accompanied by the introduction of the Key Function Eligibility Criteria Policy which outlines the requirements the persons holding the various key functions are expected to fulfil in order to satisfactorily perform these duties which are vital for the applicable regulatory outcomes.\nA public consultation on the Applicability of the System and Compliance Audit Service Provider Guidelines to Financial Audit was issued with the aim of communicating and refining the proposal being put forward in relation to revised Guidelines and in order to promote a greater understanding of the proposal itself.\nThe Authority established a dedicated Business Transformation team, tasked with assisting each of the MGA’s directorates to continuously re-assess and improve processes, to increase efficiency and reduce administrative burdens on the MGA and industry alike, and to focus resources where these truly provide added value.\n\nNational and International Cooperation\n\nA new alerting process was introduced vis-à-vis the sharing of knowledge on suspicious events that is reported with the whole industry without revealing the source of the information. Since its introduction, during the last quarter of 2021, a total of 72 alerts were sent to the industry, which resulted in a total of 20 new suspicious betting reports received via the Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism after such alerts were corresponded.\nA total of 131 requests for information specifically relating to the manipulation of sports competitions or breaches in sports rules were submitted by enforcement agencies, sport governing bodies, integrity units, and other regulatory bodies. As a result of such requests, data was exchanged in 41 instances. Additionally, a total of 329 suspicious betting reports from licensees and other concerned parties were received.\nDuring the period under review, the Authority was a direct participant in 20 different investigations across the globe relating to the manipulation of sports competitions or breaches in sports rules, as well as an indirect participant in 29 such investigations.\nThe Authority received a total of 89 international cooperation requests from other regulators and sent 75 such requests, with the majority referring to requests for background checks as part of an authorisation process.\nA total of 125 letters of Good Standing were issued providing feedback on the regulatory good standing of our licenced operators to the relevant authorities asking for this information.\nAn International Affairs Strategy has been devised as one of the measures aimed at enhancing Malta’s international credibility, fostering collaborative relationships with targeted stakeholders and mitigating the risks that the gaming industry in Malta is facing.\nIn collaboration with the Malta Institute of Accountants two technical release notices were published, “Audit 02/21 Gaming Tax Payable and Levy on Gaming Devices” and “Audit 02/21 – Player Funds and Jackpot Funds”.\nThrough a joint collaboration between the Authority, the FIAU and the MFSA, a document was published providing an overview of the key findings of Business Risk Assessments carried out by subject persons as per their obligations under the PMLFTR and the FIAU’s Implementing Procedures.\nA two-day workshop in collaboration with Bank of Valletta was organised, whereby various aspects of the control mechanisms as a Regulator were discussed.\n\nIn publishing this report, the CEO, Dr Carl Brincat said: “As an organisation, beyond continuing to ensure that we meet our day-to-day objectives, we used 2021 to start laying the groundwork for improvements that we will see in the months and years to come.  It is a priority for us to move towards leaner and more efficient processes, to remove unnecessary bureaucracy which introduces burdens on the industry without providing added value, and to become more effective in achieving our regulatory priorities.”\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Nevertheless, the MGA has lent its experience and knowledge to ensure the fair and transparent proceedings of the Lottery.\n\nDuring inspections carried out by MGA officials, it was noted that the current lottery standard operating procedures already have safeguards in place to ensure the fairness of the draw. All the received receipts are first put in containers, which are then poured into a raffle drum, that is turned after a fixed number of containers is reached and the drum is filled.  Once full, the power switch which is used to turn the raffle drum is locked with a numbered seal (disabling any movement) to avoid tampering with any of the tickets. This is also photographed, and the photo is then sent to the CFR department. The numbered seal is only cut in the presence of the board members responsible for the draw. The board comprises of a government notary, representatives from the CFR department, the Ministry for Finance and Employment, the National Audit Office, and a representative from the Public. The person that draws the tickets is chosen by the Ministry for Finance and Employment and changes at every draw. Following the draw, all remaining receipts are disposed of.\n\nAn in-depth assessment of the lottery draw; from the collection stage to the drawing stage, has been conducted by MGA officials to identify any gaps and potential issues in the process. Recommendations have already been submitted and discussed together with the Ministry for Finance and Employment.\n\nThe Fiscal Receipts Lottery involves the draw of fiscal receipts sent by the public to the Ministry for Finance and Employment. The lottery, introduced in 1990, has grown significantly over the years, with the draws reaching around 3 million fiscal receipts per month.\n\nThe Fiscal Receipts Lottery Unit and the Authority are committed to taking all the necessary actions to ensure increased transparency in relation to this lottery.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

In this light, this consultation seeks to elicit the industry’s view of a regulated market for this sector and any other feedback which the industry may have.\n\nWe ask the gaming industry and wider interest groups to engage constructively with the questions raised in this consultation.\n\nClick Here to Download – LGA Digital Games of Skill  with Price\n\nAll responses should be sent by email to [email protected] by February 4th 2015.\n\nAlternatively, responses can be sent by post to:\n\nSkill Games\nLotteries and Gaming Authority\nSuite 1, Level 3, TG Complex,\nBrewery Street Mriehel,\nBKR 3000,\nMalta\n\n \n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

This included a complete refresh of its corporate branding to better reflect the industry’s challenges, focus on Malta as the jurisdiction of choice and signal a new vision for the industry.  “The new name and logo will serve as a better representation of the Authority’s heritage, past successes, vision and values within the national agenda and in line with our strategic objectives”. This was announced by the Executive Chairman of the Malta Gaming Authority, Joseph Cuschieri during the launch of the new corporate identity for the Authority which was presided by the Minister for the Economy, Investment and Small Business, Dr Chris Cardona and Parliamentary Secretary for Competitiveness and Economic Growth, Dr José Herrera.\n\nFrom Left to Right: Hon. Minister – Dr Chris Cardona, Executive Chairman – Mr. Joseph Cuschieri, Hon. Parliamentary Secretary – Dr. José Herrera\n\nThe new corporate logo was launched during an event at the Westin Dragonara Resort, where the Executive Chairman gave an overview about the values behind the new corporate branding which consist of transparency, care, integrity and responsibility.\n\nThe event also saw the launch of the MGA’s new intuitive website at mgaorgmt.kinsta.cloud, with a highly improved look and feel. The new portal makes use of the latest technology like responsive web design, aimed at providing an optimal viewing experience to users on desktop monitors, laptops, smart phones and tablets. It also offers a unique opportunity for players to communicate directly with the Player Support team of the Authority through the live chat facility.  Furthermore, the MGA also announced the launch of its social media presence, through new Facebook and Twitter pages including a revamped LinkedIn page.  All the digital media channels will be updated on a regular basis.\n\nSince 2001, the LGA has been the public single regulatory body responsible for the governance of all forms of gaming in Malta, including: Amusement Machines, Broadcasting Media Games, Casinos, Commercial Bingo Halls, Gaming Devices, the National Lottery, Non-Profit Games and Remote Gaming.\n\nToday, Malta is at the forefront of the remote gaming industry, hosting some of the world’s biggest online gaming operators and hailed as one of the top remote gaming jurisdictions in the world. In light of such accomplishments, the MGA will continue to competently regulate the various sectors of the gaming industry which fall under its responsibility by ensuring that; gaming is fair and transparent to the players, preventing crime and money laundering, and by protecting minors and vulnerable players. The successful establishment of the Responsible Gaming Foundation and the introduction of Gaming Malta and the Gaming Academy later this year will continue to consolidate Malta’s position as a centre of excellence. From this position of strength, the MGA will keep innovating and optimising its operations for the benefit of all stakeholders.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

It is the intention of the LGA to release guidelines for the Remote Gaming operators making use of cloud solutions. It will also allow facilities to be used as cloud service providers in defined circumstances for gaming transactions.\n\nThis consultation is proposing a sharper focus on long-standing principles, with a clearer explanation of why they are important from a policy and regulatory perspective.\n\nWe ask the gaming industry and wider interest groups to engage constructively with the questions raised in this consultation.\n\nProposed Cloud Solutions for Remote Gaming Industry\n\n All responses should be sent by email to [email protected] by 12 December 2014.\n\nAlternatively, responses can be sent by post to:\nCloud Solutions\nLotteries and Gaming Authority\nSuite 1, Level 3, TG Complex,\nBrewery Street Mriehel, BKR 3000, Malta\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The number of registered companies also went up by 17% to 258 when compared to 220 in 2013, whilst total revenue went up by 1.3% when compared to same period of last year. At the same time license processing time has been reduced by 50%, from an average of 5 months to an average of 2.5 months.\n\n“I am satisfied with what the LGA has achieved so far both in terms of financial and regulatory performance,” said Joseph Cuschieri, Executive Chairman of the Lotteries and Gaming Authority. “Malta is a major player in the global remote gaming industry and our solid reputation was instrumental for our growth trajectory. Having said this, what got us here won’t take us there hence the importance of innovation and reform in order to maintain a competitive edge and stay ahead of other jurisdictions. This, coupled with the support of a business friendly government which strongly believes in the gaming industry, is crucial in our efforts to future proof this industry for the next decade.”\n\nMr. Cuschieri continued his address by highlighting other initiatives taking place at the LGA, with major focus on the regulatory overhaul which will see the launch of a new innovative and cutting edge legal framework, towards the end of next year. He also underscored the Authority’s office relocation to Smart City Malta, the market repositioning program and also other activities related to the EU and international fora. Finally LGA’s Executive Chairman also highlighted LGA’s latest consultation document on Cloud Solutions, which is available online on www.lga.org.mt.\n\nDr Herrera was next to address the press, and he spoke about the importance of having a skilled labour force. “We need to be more competitive and have a stronger workforce” he said, and stressed the need for more people to widen their technical knowledge and be employed within the gaming industry. “A survey carried out in 2013 shows that 77% of foreign companies do not find enough Maltese workers that have the necessary skills to work in this sector.” Dr Hererra explained how the launch of the Gaming Academy in the first quarter of next year, is set to be one of the steps taken by the Authority that will help to increase employment rates in Malta in this sector.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

He spoke about the evolution of the gaming industry in Malta and outlined why Malta became the gaming centre in Europe. Upper Reach also discussed the LGA’s licensing program and its control methods, as well as the authority’s plans to orient towards the East in order to take full advantage of the new markets and opportunities emerging there.\n\nThis is a year of celebration for Malta, not just of how far you have come in the last 50 years of independence but also many other celebrations. Many countries in the European Union are going through hard times, while Malta is doing very well. I would like to ask you, what is the recipe for success in Malta?\n\nMalta managed to steer itself safely through the crisis. If we look back at 2008, I think one of the most important aspects of our economic dynamics is our banking system: it is a very conservative, robust and well capitalised banking system. The banks here do not take unnecessary risks. We also have a strong regulatory framework which keeps the banking system in check. So, unlike other countries, we didn’t have to use taxpayers’ money to re-capitalise banks like other countries had to do.\n\nThe other aspect I think is the openness and diversity of our economy and the entrepreneurial spirit of many Maltese businessmen. The vast majority of the largest businesses in Malta are usually family-run businesses who are involved in different sectors of the economy including overseas investments. So, for example, you can have a group of companies which is involved in the automobile business, tourism, property and retail.  So if one sector is not doing well, there are other sectors that keep going hence compensating for the downturn in others. In other European jurisdictions if, for example, you are solely involved in the automobile business and the business experience a downturn, they will have no option but to lay off people to keep the business running.\n\nFast forward to today, we have a new administration which is very dynamic and business friendly. In fact, this year we will probably close the year with a 2.8% to 3% growth in our GDP, which is very good by any standard. Unemployment is at roughly the 6 percent level. Some of this unemployment is a result of the skills mismatch with the new economic sectors like remote gaming, ICT and e-commerce. In remote gaming, for example, two thirds of the people employed in this sector are foreigners. While there is nothing wrong in that, the fact is that there are jobs for the Maltese, but there isn’t the skill available to fill certain positions. In other sectors like ICT services, it’s the same thing. There are opportunities but the unemployed are people who either don’t want to work or don’t have the skills for these new growing economic sectors. I would call it artificial unemployment, because the economy overall is growing.\n\nTo continue reading, go to the full interview HERE.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

During the same period total operating expenditure amounted to €2.9m compared to €3.3m in 2012. Furthermore, the Authority registered a surplus amounting to €49.9m compared to €49.5m in 2012. As a result, the LGA transferred to Government the amount of €48.8m compared to €47.5m in the previous year.\n\nCommenting on these results, LGA Executive Chairman Joseph Cuschieri said that: “These results continue to sustain the importance and value creation ability of the gaming industry for the Maltese economy. The Authority is currently undergoing a major restructuring, investment and capacity building programme in order to strengthen the LGA’s operational structures and define a new future proof strategy for the Authority and for the gaming industry itself. This will have the benefit of driving growth for the industry and reposition Malta as the top gaming jurisdiction globally. We have set out an ambitious reformist and growth agenda which we are focused on delivering”.\n\nMr Cuschieri took the opportunity to introduce his new executive management team which is now composed of Ing. Paul Fenech (Chief Officer – Strategy & Business Planning), Dr Dominic Micallef (Chief Officer – Investigations and Enforcement), Vincent Marmara (Chief Regulatory Officer), Dr Edwina Licari (Chief Legal Officer), Heathcliff Farrugia (Chief Operations Officer) and Carlo Mifsud (Chief Financial Officer). Commenting on his new executive team Mr Cuschieri said: “This is an excellent group of talented and professional individuals who possess strong academic backgrounds and work experience whom I am convinced can help me steer the LGA towards more future success”.\n\nThe Audited Financial Statement is available under the Consultations & Publications Section.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Owing to the circumstances, Malta voted against the adoption of the Convention. While Malta has always agreed with the objective of the Convention to combat match-fixing, it held the view that the sports betting provisions have gone beyond the scope.\n\nThe Convention will now be opened for signature of the various States on the 18th September in Macolin, Switzerland.\n\nMeanwhile, Malta has filed a request for opinion of the Courts of Justice of the European Union under the procedure set out in Article 218 (11) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), asking the Court to clarify whether the envisaged Convention, and in particular the definition of “illegal sports betting”, coupled with the betting provisions, Articles 9 and 11 thereof, are compatible with the Treaties and in particular, with Articles 18, 49 and 56 TFEU.\n\nMalta, represented by the Lotteries and Gaming Authority (the LGA) and other relevant local entities, joined the drafting negotiations of a draft Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions in March 2013 and participated actively until January 2014 when the drafting plenary group closed. Thereafter, it continued to take an active interest in the different political processes which followed until adoption, in order to clearly deliver and maintain its position on the matter.\n\nWhile Malta has always agreed with the objectives of this Convention that are principally aimed to combat manipulation and fraud in sports, it has maintained reservations on the betting provisions which in its view, have gone beyond the objectives and scope of the Convention.\n\nSince the beginning of the drafting process, Malta has objected to the definition of “illegal sports betting” (Article 3.5.a) which is linked to the notion of national authorisation and the jurisdiction where the consumer is located. Through its application, sports betting activity in any one state shall be considered illegal if the applicable law of the jurisdiction of the consumer of the betting service considers it to be so. Thus, the definition does not specifically target unregulated sports betting that can entice the manipulation of sports and fraud, which is the subject of the Convention. On the contrary, it targets operators which are merely ‘not allowed’ in the jurisdiction of the consumer, with the consequence that the definition encompasses not only unregulated operators but also regulated operators in Contracting Parties to the Convention.\n\nFurther provisions in the Convention relating to betting (Articles 9 to 11) set rules to be imposed on “illegal” betting operators. Article 11 in particular lays down a number of measures which may be taken against “illegal” betting operators. Operators operating across borders which are legally compliant and subject to the monitoring and control measures foreseen by the draft Convention, may therefore be deemed illegal by the law of the country of the consumer and blocked through a variety of methods allowed by the Convention.\n\nThis clearly misses the paramount objective of the Convention to holistically address the risks to sports integrity, and has the unnecessary and harmful effect of clamping down on regulated operators. It also has the consequence of requiring Contracting Parties to act against each other’s duly regulated operators. The net effect is an unwelcome divergence from the Convention’s objectives and an unnecessary intrusion into the regulation of betting, with negative consequences for regulated operators and legitimate regulated betting industries.\n\nMalta was always consistent as regard its objections on these provisions from the start of the negotiations. During the Standing Committee meeting that took place in Baku on the 23rd May, Malta made a proposal for the amendment of the definition. Although it gained some support, this proposal was not accepted. Malta made further proposals during the Gr-C meetings of the Council of Europe on 17th June, 1st and 8th July respectively, which were rejected. Consequently, in the circumstances Malta had no option but to vote against the adoption of this Convention, while making clear that it continues to fully support the objectives.\n\nOn a European Union level, Malta has always maintained the view that the definition of “illegal sports betting” and the other betting provisions in the Convention are incompatible with the Treaties. The gaming industry is not yet regulated within the EU and discussions regarding the best approach are still underway in various fora. The provisions of the Convention relating to betting may lead to harmonisation of an area that is not yet harmonized at EU level, thus going beyond the scope of the Convention itself as it is not the appropriate instrument to deal with these matters.\n\nMalta declared these reservations during the negotiations of the Convention. The European Commission, which received a mandate to participate in the drafting negotiations, tried to pacify the various positions of the Member States. Despite this as well as various attempts from Malta, the majority of the countries, including EU Member States, were in favour of maintaining the definition that makes reference to the country of the consumer and the other betting provisions.\n\nMalta has now filed a request under the Article 218 (11) TFEU procedure to the Court of Justice of the European Union. By means of this procedure, Malta hopes to clarify amongst other arguments, whether the definition of “illegal sports betting” in the Convention, as well as the other articles ancillary to the definition, are compatible with the provisions of the Treaty.\n\nMalta holds that the envisaged Convention seeks to introduce the regulation of the betting industry, which is not a settled matter in the EU. The Convention is thus an inappropriate instrument for the matter and is being used to bypass the correct procedures under the Treaty, which can also impact on the future of the passing of regulation in the sector. The definition which has been introduced in the Convention relates exclusively to the licensing and regulation of operators, which is not the subject of the Convention. The question of legality of the gaming industry has to be viewed in line with the general principles guaranteed by the Treaty and in particular with what is necessary, suitable and proportional.\n\nMalta, its government and the LGA have always prioritised the interests of its successful gaming industry. The gaming industry is effectively regulated and Malta will continue to defend its operators’ interests in the face of this and similar attempts against it.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

A review of the Authority’s accomplishments for the first half of 2022 is provided in the report, together with a description of the Maltese gaming industry’s performance over the same period. The latter provides a medium-term outlook towards the future, as well as an analysis outlining important statistics for the land-based and online gaming industries.\n\nSupervisory Activities\n\nDuring this period, 16 compliance audits were conducted together with 114 desktop reviews, accompanied by an additional seven AML/CFT compliance examinations that were initiated by the MGA on behalf of the FIAU. Additionally, the Authority issued a warning, cancelled a licence as well as suspended another authorised entity, following information which emerged from compliance audits, compliance reviews and formal investigations. Furthermore, the MGA issued a total of seven administrative penalties as well as two regulatory settlements, with a collective total financial penalty of €85,000.\nEnforcement measures were also issued by the FIAU to an additional four licensees, ranging from written reprimands to administrative penalties, with an emphasis on remediation measures, based on the breaches identified during examinations carried out in previous years, including by the MGA. In total, these amounted to just over €386,567.\nBased primarily on reducing the risk of money laundering or funding terrorism, the Fit & Proper Committee determined that four individuals and entities did not meet the Authority’s fit and properness criteria, while an additional two applications were rejected by the Supervisory Council.\nA total of 626 criminal probity screening checks were undertaken on personnel, shareholders, ultimate beneficial owners, key individuals, employees, and businesses from the land-based and online gambling sectors.\nIn the first half of the year, 22 interviews with prospective money laundering reporting officers (MLROs) and key persons carrying out the AML/CFT function were carried out, with the aim of determining the knowledge and suitability of each candidate.\nA total of six letters of breach were issued by the MGA’s Commercial Communications Committee (S.L. 583.09), out of which five operators were deemed to have violated the Commercial Communications Regulations.\nIn its efforts to safeguard players and promote responsible gaming, the Authority assisted a total of 2,578 players who requested assistance, covering the majority of the cases received during 2022 and the spillover from 2021.\nA total of 22 cases of websites having misleading references to the Authority were investigated, while a total of 13 notices were published on the MGA’s website with the aim of preventing the public from falling victim to such scams. Furthermore, an additional 18 responsible gambling website checks were conducted, and five observation letters were issued.\n\nNational and International Cooperation\n\nBetween January and June 2022, a total of 122 alerts on suspicious betting were sent to the industry. Following correspondence of these alerts, the Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism received a total of 16 new suspicious betting reports.\nEnforcement agencies, sports governing bodies, integrity units, and other regulatory authorities made a total of 23 requests for information, specifically in relation to the manipulation of sporting events or violations of sporting regulations. Subsequently, 10 of these requests resulted in the exchange of data. In addition, 278 allegations of suspicious betting from licensees and other interested parties were received.\nThe Authority participated directly in 12 separate investigations into sports rules violations or manipulation of sporting competitions during the time under review. In addition, the Authority also participated indirectly in another investigation.\nThe Authority sent 64 requests for international cooperation, the majority of which related to requests for background checks as part of an authorisation process. Furthermore, the Authority received a total of 36 requests for international collaboration from other regulators.\nUp to the end of June 2022, a total of 84 official replies were issued, providing feedback on the regulatory good standing of our licensed operators to the relevant authorities asking for this information.\nIn total, during the first six months of the year, the MGA received just over 100 requests for information from other local regulating authorities and governing bodies.\n\nThe MGA will publish a full-year industry performance report during the second half of 2023, when it publishes its Annual Report for the financial year ending 31 December 2022.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

In this spirit, in recent years, the Maltese Government has launched a voluntary ESG reporting platform to encourage companies to publicly report on their ESG performance, thus driving investment towards sustainable businesses.\n\nWhile the Authority is proud of the consistent progress of the gaming sector and acknowledges the good work done by its licensees, some of which currently report on ESG publicly, starting from 2024, all large or listed companies will be required to report under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (‘CSRD’). In this context, in an effort to remain at the forefront of innovation and forward-looking practices, the MGA embarked on a journey to develop a voluntary code of good practice for the remote gaming sector to help guide and prepare local licensees for upcoming ESG legislation, and to potentially derive the benefits tied to running a sustainably conscious operation\n\nThe code will set out the common priorities for ESG in gaming, taking into consideration the needs of key stakeholders, to reduce environmental, social and governance impacts whilst continually enhancing Malta’s reputation as a leading Gaming jurisdiction.\n\nLooking ahead, we expect to see more and more companies taking concrete actions towards becoming more sustainable, and we believe that reporting such efforts contributes positively to implementing change within the sector and improving its overall perception, while also addressing the increasing demand for transparency and accountability in the industry.\n\nAs part of this initiative, the MGA has launched a survey with its licensees who are the key partners in the process of transforming the gaming sector into a more sustainable and transparent one.\n\nKindly reach out to the Authority at [email protected], if you have any queries.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Such collaboration shall augment even further, the existing deterrents and shall ensure that the possibility of achieving unfair winnings, (a phenomenon which is particularly present with respect to unregulated betting activities) remains shut out of the regulated markets, such as that regulated by the LGA.\n\nThe EWS – LGA MOU shall bring together FIFA’s early warning system, the LGA and its betting licensees to exchange betting-related information to assist the investigation of betting patterns or insider betting connected with sporting events and competitions.\n\nThe MOU was signed by Mr Reuben Portanier, CEO of the Lotteries and Gaming Authority and Dr Urs Scherrer, CEO of FIFA Early Warning System GmbH.\n\nCommenting on this important collaboration, Malta’s Minister of Finance, the Economy and Industry, Mr Tonio Fenech, stated that such a collaborative agreement between the LGA and FIFA reflects the importance that the Maltese Legislation places on game fairness in all senses. Minister Fenech also stated that Malta has, in addition to very strict Gaming Legislation, a specific legal framework to prevent corruption in sports. Thus, such collaboration forms an important addition to complement the intention and spirit of the law. Minister Fenech congratulated both the LGA and the FIFA Early Warning System for engaging in such a collaborative framework.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The LGA’s Executive Chairman, Mr. Joseph Cuschieri invited the Management Board of the Council to discuss the strategy of the Authority and introduce the new Management team. Mr. Cuschieri highlighted the areas and processes within the Authority where he deems most important to become more efficient and less bureaucratic. He also acknowledged the challenges the industry is facing and expressed his commitment to strengthen the industry and retain Malta’s position as a top gaming jurisdiction.\n\nOn their part MRGC highlighted where and how the Industry had benefitted in the past by working closely with the LGA with common objectives. Both parties expressed their satisfaction to have the opportunity to meet and committed themselves to work together to achieve further growth in the industry. The LGA invited the Council to consult with the Authority on issues of concern in the gaming industry in order to assess possible solutions.\n\nMr. Cuschieri closed the meeting by thanking the Council for meeting with the Authority and for their offer of full co-operation whilst assuring them that this would be the first of many productive meetings. He concluded that whilst he wanted to streamline and improve processes at no time would the Authority relax its regulatory obligations and it would be re-focusing its efforts and resources on the high risk matters rather than on checklists and unnecessary red tape that provided no value to the industry or comfort to the regulator.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

During the same period total operating expenditure amounted to €2.9m compared to €3.3m in 2012. Furthermore, the Authority registered a surplus amounting to €49.9m compared to €49.5m in 2012.

The Authority is currently undergoing a major restructuring, investment and capacity building programme in order to strengthen the LGA’s operational structures and define a new future proof strategy for the Authority and for the gaming industry itself. This will have the benefit of driving growth for the industry and reposition Malta as the top gaming jurisdiction globally. We have set out an ambitious reformist and growth agenda which we are focused on delivering”.\n\nMr Cuschieri took the opportunity to introduce his new executive management team which is now composed of Ing. Paul Fenech (Chief Officer – Strategy & Business Planning), Dr Dominic Micallef (Chief Officer – Investigations and Enforcement), Vincent Marmara (Chief Regulatory Officer), Dr Edwina Licari (Chief Legal Officer), Heathcliff Farrugia (Chief Operations Officer) and Carlo Mifsud (Chief Financial Officer).

It is simply an interpretation of the ordre public grounds for refusal envisaged in said EU regulation.\n\nMoreover, the scope of the amendments enacted into law is highly restricted, and the law does not preclude any action whatsoever from being taken against a licensee. Therefore, not every judgment relating to the operations of gaming operators with a Maltese licence would be in violation of Maltese public policy.\n\nArticle 56A sets out cumulative elements that must first be fulfilled before it can be triggered.\n\nThe provisions shall only be applicable when the action – taken by an operator against a player, or a player against an operator – conflicts with or undermines the legality of the Maltese framework, and is related to activity which is lawful in terms of the Gaming Act and the other regulatory instruments applicable to the Malta Gaming Authority’s licensees.\n\nThe Maltese gaming framework, in turn, is in full conformity with EU law and is based on the freedoms afforded to an entity established within the internal market.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Indeed, more than 50% of the remote gaming exhibition area was occupied by companies operating in Malta exhibiting their services.\n\nICE has provided manufacturers and creators with the finest marketplace for their products and services. It has also provided industry professionals with direct access to everything that will enhance and grow their business by bringing together industry regulators from around the world.\n\nMalta Enterprise, which was participating in this specialised event for the first time, received several enquiries on trade and investment opportunties and fiscal incentives that the country offers.\n\n“We have joined forces with the Lotteries and Gaming Authority under the ThincMalta umbrella in order to strengthen our efforts to actively promote trade and investment in Malta. During the event, we registered considerable interest in Malta and our personnel were also on hand to respond to any queries that visitors had,” said Alan Camilleri, Malta Enterprise’s executive chairman.\n\nAs the regulators of the online gaming operators, the Lotteries and Gaming Authority has been participating in this event for the past seven years.\n\nMr Reuben Portanier, CEO of LGA commented “Malta’s presence at this important event in the gaming calendar was key as it provides industry stakeholders the opportunity to obtain information from the Lotteries and Gaming Authority on Malta’s regulatory regime, whilst information on the economic and market structures could also be obtained through Malta Enterprise. The interest was extremely high showing how vibrant the Maltese regime is, whilst the LGA officials held an astonishing 160 meetings over three days, excluding visitors who were present on the stand.”\n\nThe Maltese High Commissioner in London, Mr Joseph Zammit Tabona also attended the exhibition halls and visited the Maltese exhibitors. He commended the new concept that local authorities join forces together to offer services to foreign clients and praised the very high standard of the Malta Pavilion.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The amendments are aimed to strengthen and clarify the current player protection framework. This framework will support the Authority’s initiatives moving forward and shall facilitate the Authority’s plans to continuously improve the player protection framework, including the eventual publication of detailed player protection guidelines for Licensees. The Authority is in the process of conducting detailed research and garnering expert experience to serve as the foundation for the eventual publication of such guidelines.\n\nAs a first step, the amendments being proposed that are subject to the ongoing closed consultation delve into, inter alia, the licensees’ obligations regarding their responsible gaming policies and procedures and the introduction of five (5) markers of harm that must be considered by licensees when determining effective measures and processes to detect and address problem gambling. Provisions relating to real-money reinforcement and staff training have also been included in the proposed amendments.\n\nThe amendments are being proposed on the basis of a review of the key sections of the Directive carried out by an expert in the field, and on the basis of the Authority’s own research and experience garnered through the Responsible Gaming Unit’s audits and familiarisation visits.\n\nThe ongoing consultation shall give the opportunity to licensees to provide their feedback, if any, regarding the proposed amendments. The consultation period shall run until the 14th October 2022.\n\nKindly contact the Authority on [email protected] with any queries or feedback regarding the consultation.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Such collaboration shall augment even further, the existing deterrents and shall ensure that the possibility of achieving unfair winnings, (a phenomenon which is particularly present with respect to unregulated betting activities) remains shut out of the regulated markets, such as that regulated by the LGA.\n\nThe IOC – LGA MOU shall bring together the ISM’s early warning system, the LGA and its betting licensees to exchange betting-related information to assist the investigation of betting patterns or insider betting connected with the London Olympic Games. The MOU was signed by Mr Reuben Portanier, CEO of the Lotteries and Gaming Authority and Mr Detlev Zenglein of the International Sports Monitoring GmbH on behalf of the International Olympic Committee.\n\nThe MOU signed between the LGA and the International Olympic Committee is the LGA’s third MOU specifically targeted on Sport Integrity, thus enforcing LGA’s committed strategy and actions towards collaborating on sport integrity.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Dr Kimberley believes such collaboration initiatives will demonstrate that match-fixing through sport betting does not find fertile ground in thoroughly regulated jurisdictions such as Malta’s.\n\nMr Khalid Ali, the Secretary General of ESSA said “it’s in all our interests to defeat betting related match-fixing. By signing an MoU with the LGA in Malta we have a direct link with the Regulator to report any suspicious betting patterns thereby developing a robust eco-system to protect the interests of consumers, sport and the betting operators.”\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"
