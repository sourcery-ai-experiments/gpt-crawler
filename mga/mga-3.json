Such licenses were awarded following the coming into force of the Gaming Devices Regulations as on 16th of May 2011.\n\nIn order to be granted a license, an operator needs to pass through a very detailed licensing process, including the requirement to hold a valid MEPA development permit. The LGA would like to re-iterate what it stated in public in the past, that the mere fact that an operator holds a MEPA development permit does not result in an automatic granting of a gaming license. In fact, a number of applications have been refused on the grounds of non-compliance with the Regulations falling under the Lotteries and Other Games Act or the Location of Gaming Parlours Directive. In order for the LGA to grant a license (which is valid for 12 months), Gaming Parlours have to be at least 75 meters away from certain premises listed in the Directive, including schools, places of worship (such as Churches, Mosques, etc.) and playgrounds.\n\nFurthermore, throughout the licensing period, the licensees have to adhere to a number of requirements such as a minimum payout percentage to players of 85%, maximum bets and low maximum winnings and provide their customers detailed reports on the payout percentages of each machine, the money and time spent playing by the requesting player and the odds of the games.\n\nThe LGA would like to inform the general public that licensed gaming parlours are mandated to adhere to numerous player protection requirements, and adhere to social considerations as per law, such as the requirement to offer customers the option to self-exclude themselves for a period of either 6 or 12 months from all gaming establishments, including Casinos and Bingo Halls. Such high standards of player protection and regulatory supervision make a clear distinction between what is licensed today (in the public interest) as opposed to having illegal gaming devices in any establishment without any form of restrictions or direct supervision.\n\nA gaming parlour can easily be identified whether it is licensed by the LGA or not, as the operator is mandated to clearly display the LGA license certificate at their reception desk, players need to formally register to enter the gaming parlour, whilst each gaming device clearly tagged by the LGA and therefore easily identifiable from illegal devices.\n\nThe LGA insists that customers should make sure that they do not play on unauthorised gaming machines or modified computers in bars and other outlets as they may be prosecuted and if found guilty may be fined for up to €235,000 and imprisoned for up to 5 years. Such fines also apply to whoever makes available for use, hosts or operates such illegal gaming devices. The LGA calls on the public, NGO’s and Local Councils to assist the LGA in its enforcement efforts against illegal gaming by reporting such illegal activity.\n\nFor any inquires, please visit the LGA website http://www.lga.org.mt or contact the LGA on [email protected].\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

In addition to outlining the performance of the Maltese gaming business in 2022, the report gives a broad summary of the Authority’s accomplishments during the year under review and offers a medium-term outlook for the future. A thorough report outlining key statistics for the land-based and online gaming industries is then presented.\n\nSupervisory Activities\n\n28 compliance audits were conducted and 228 desktop reviews were carried out during 2022, accompanied by additional AML/CFT compliance examinations that are carried out by the FIAU, or by the MGA on its behalf. Following information which emerged from compliance audits, compliance reviews and formal investigations, the Authority issued 10 warnings and cancelled six (6) licences. In addition, the MGA issued a total of 16 administrative penalties as well as three (3) regulatory settlements, with a collective total financial penalty of €179,150.\nA total of 25 licensees were subject to remediation and/or administrative measures by the FIAU, ranging from written reprimands to administrative penalties, based on the breaches identified during examinations carried out in previous years, including by the MGA. In total, these amounted to just over €738,000.\nSix (6) individuals and companies were deemed by the Fit & Proper Committee to not be up to the Authority’s probity standards due to various factors, including due to the risks of money laundering or funding of terrorism.\nForty-one (41) gaming licence applications were received during 2022. Thirty-one (31) licences were issued, while twenty-one (21) were unsuccessful.\nOver 1,500 criminal probity screening checks were undertaken on individuals, shareholders and ultimate beneficial owners, key persons and other employees, and companies from both the land-based and online gaming sectors.\nThe Authority conducted 48 interviews with prospective MLROs and key persons carrying out the AML/CFT function to determine the knowledge and suitability of each candidate.\nThe Commercial Communication Committee of the MGA issued a total of nine (9) Letters of Breach following breaches of the Commercial Communications Regulations (S.L. 583.09).\nIn its efforts to protect players and encourage responsible gambling, the Authority supported a total of 5,280 players who requested assistance, covering most of the cases received during 2022 and the spill-over from 2021.\nThe MGA conducted 85 responsible gaming-themed website checks, through which 38 URLs were found to have misleading information. This led to 17 notices being published on the MGA website, and 30 observation letters that were sent out reflecting responsible gaming issues.\n\nImprovements in Efficiency and Effectiveness\n\nThe Authority commissioned a sectorial skills strategy to address the gaming industry’s challenges with respect to the ongoing demand for qualified and skilled human capital, which increased significantly as the economy grew and diversified into numerous sectors.\nConsultation exercises were conducted with industry stakeholders regarding the bets offered by licensees – with a focus on sports integrity and player protection considerations – on the proposed amendments to the Player Protection Directive (Directive 2 of 2018), and on the proposed policy on the use of Innovative Technology Arrangements (ITAs) and the acceptance of Virtual Financial Assets (VFAs) and Virtual Tokens, which led to amendments and a finalised Policy, respectively.\nThe Authority streamlined the approval process of appointing an MLRO in collaboration with the FIAU while, at the same time, ensuring that the industry is kept updated on any changes affecting this process and on any best practices that are intrinsic to the role of the MLRO.\nThe concept of Agreed-Upon Procedures (AUPs) Reports was introduced, covering player funds and Gaming Revenue. Audit firms are drawing up these reports in compliance with the ‘International Standard on Related Services (ISRS) 4400 (Revised) Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagements’.\nThe MGA kickstarted a process for possibly implementing a voluntary Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Code of Good Practice for the industry to showcase and increase the positive social and environmental impacts of the gambling sector.\n\nNational and International Cooperation\n\nThroughout 2022, the Authority issued 43 news items on its website and 26 external communications, providing a synopsis of various updates and developments at the Authority and across the industry.\nA total of 224 alerts were sent to the industry, 167 of which were also sent to the appropriate Sports Governing Bodies.\nA total of 44 requests for information specifically relating to the manipulation of sports competitions or breaches in sports rules were submitted by enforcement agencies, sport governing bodies, integrity units, and other regulatory bodies. As a result of such requests, data was exchanged in 25 instances. Additionally, a total of 475 suspicious betting reports from licensees and other concerned parties were received.\nDuring the period under review, the Authority was a direct participant in 15 different investigations across the globe relating to the manipulation of sports competitions or breaches in sports rules, as well as an indirect participant in 3 such investigations.\nThe Authority received a total of 83 international cooperation requests from other regulators and sent 97 such requests, with the majority referring to requests for background checks as part of an authorisation process.\nA total of 177 official replies were issued providing feedback on the regulatory good standing of our licensed operators to the relevant authorities asking for this information.\nThe MGA works together with other local regulating authorities and governing bodies. This is reflected through responses furnished by the MGA to requests for information made by the Asset Recovery Bureau (ARB), the FIAU, as well as the MPF on the gaming sector. Additionally, the relevant information is provided to the Sanctions Monitoring Board (SMB) to assist in issuing penalties in instances of non-compliance with sanctions screening obligations.\n\nIn publishing this report, the CEO, Dr Carl Brincat said: “This report is testament to our collective efforts in promoting a fair and sustainable gaming ecosystem. Through proactive measures and leaner regulation processes, we strive to ensure a level playing field that nurtures innovation while safeguarding against any potential risks.\n\n“As the global gaming landscape evolves, our role becomes even more critical. We embrace this responsibility with utmost determination, working tirelessly to stay ahead of emerging trends, technologies, and challenges.  We remain steadfast in our pursuit of robust frameworks that inspire confidence, protect vulnerable individuals and render Malta the home for gaming operators of good will.”\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

This enables licensees to operate cross-border from Malta, provided that a justifiable legal reason to provide their services to customers in such a jurisdiction exists, and always in compliance with the robust legal framework that is established under Maltese law and their licence conditions.\n\nThis ensures that consumers choose to engage and play within a regulated market, which is subject to strict legal obligations aimed at protecting players and which is overseen by a competent regulator that is empowered to take swift enforcement action in cases of non-compliance on the part of the licensee.\n\nThe scope of the amendments enacted into law is restricted, and the law does not preclude any action whatsoever from being taken against a licensee. The provisions shall only be applicable when the action – taken by an operator against a player, or a player against an operator – conflicts with or undermines the legality of the Maltese framework, and is related to activity which is lawful in terms of the Gaming Act and the other regulatory instruments applicable to the Malta Gaming Authority’s licensees.\n\nSimilarly, foreign judgments that fulfil the aforementioned criteria shall not be recognised and enforced in Malta, since the amendments are intended to clarify that such judgments are manifestly against the public policy (ordre public) of Malta.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

All submissions were then reviewed by panels of independent experts. The top three submissions overall were forwarded to the next stage of the competition which was a presentation of their research in front of a second expert panel.\n\nThis year’s finalists were: Julia De Marco whose dissertation was ‘A Comparative Analysis of the Place of Supply Rules: The Future of Online Gaming in Malta’. Renzo Galea with ’Modelling Football Data’ and Karl Gonzi with ‘a Critical Analysis of the Remote Gaming Regulations 2004 and Suggested Improvements by Reference to Local and Foreign Legislation’\n\nThe Betsson awards winner of 2011 is Mr Renzo Galea with ‘Modelling Football Data’ which investigates the Bayesian modeling performance for football data.  Mr Galea used real data from the Italian Seria A championship to illustrate the Bayesian modeling performance and proofed the possibility of predicting outcomes.\n\nReuben Portanier, CEO of the LGA stated,   ”The LGA supports all initiatives that promote research in the field of gaming, whilst we also embrace Industry to Academia initiatives such as this, as it creates an opportunity to bridge academic research with business realities”.\n\nDr. Anton Bartolo on behalf of the University of Malta commented that the University of Malta welcomes this initiative by Betsson, as well as the collaboration with the Lotteries and Gaming Authority on the award. It is in line with the University’s continued endeavour to engage with industry and Government to ensure that education and research at the University are relevant to businesses and to Malta’s socio-economic development. The gaming industry has a strong and growing presence in Malta, and the University welcomes collaboration in this sector, particularly in supporting social responsibility.\n\nHenrik Persson, CEO of Betsson stated that Betsson aims to play an important role in the future development of the gaming industry in Malta. The company views a long term relationship between the University, private enterprise and the Authority as an obvious requirement for continued positive development of the industry. Henrik Persson said that the company took a long term strategic decision when investing in Malta and those initiatives such as this award scheme are to be continued and extended to other areas of the business. The Betsson CEO concluded that the company considers itself privileged to have participated in the setting up of this initiative.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Furthermore, the Unit will also be liaising with other Directorates within the MGA to implement various policy initiatives, such as bringing into force the provisions at law relating to the reporting of suspicious betting activity by gaming operators to the MGA, signing agreements and deepening collaboration with entities having similar objectives and otherwise establishing a culture of cooperation amongst industry stakeholders to tackle the worldwide problem of corruption in sports.\n\nThe Unit will be headed by Senior Executive Antonio Zerafa as Sports Integrity Officer. Mr Zerafa has been at the MGA for 4 years, and has held various positions within the Criminal Probity Screening Department within the Enforcement Directorate and serves as Secretary to the MGA’s Fit & Proper Committee. He holds a Degree in Criminology from the University of Malta, wherein he is a Visiting Lecturer, a Master’s Degree in Counter Fraud & Counter Corruption Studies from the University of Portsmouth, and is currently reading for a PhD in Law and Criminology with a focus on gaming-related crime at the Sheffield Hallam University.\n\nThe MGA’s CEO Heathcliff Farrugia stated that: “Having a dedicated Sports Integrity Unit is vital for the MGA’s statutory objective to ensure that gambling is free from crime, specifically the manipulation of sports competitions. The MGA is committing to cooperation with stakeholders to the extent permitted by law to act against a pervasive phenomenon that threatens the integrity of both the sports and the betting industries.”\n\nThe MGA informs the public that any matters/queries related to sports integrity or suspicious betting are to be forwarded via email.  The MGA treats all cases in strict confidence as per article 8 of the Gaming Act (Chapter 583 of the Laws of Malta).\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

It enables the MGA and the Malta FA to share not only crucial data but also expertise.”\n\nThe MGA’s Chief Executive Officer, Heathcliff Farrugia, emphasised the importance of this agreement, stating: “This Data Sharing Agreement follows a number of MoUs signed by the MGA with other regulatory bodies throughout 2019, and also ties in perfectly with MGA’s recent establishment of a dedicated Sports Integrity Unit. The Authority is committed to ensure that this agreement is not limited to data sharing, but also sharing of ideas and best practices for the benefit of both entities.”\n\nThe Data Sharing Agreement comes into force as of 5 December 2019.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is the first agreement between the MGA’s new Unit and a betting monitoring system and underlines the desire of both parties to tackle betting related corruption.\n\nKhalid Ali, CEO of the International Betting Integrity Association, said: “The creation of the Sports Integrity Unit and its focus on tackling match-fixing is a very welcome move, which is why I am delighted to have reached this agreement with the MGA that will allow us to work collaboratively on integrity. For its part, IBIA will utilise its unique global betting monitoring system, which includes many of the largest MGA licensed operators, to provide information on suspicious betting to the Unit with the aim of preventing sports betting related corruption.”\n\nAntonio Zerafa, the MGA’s Sports Integrity Officer, said: “The MGA has made the fight against the manipulation of sports competitions a core part of its licensing and regulatory policy. Working in partnership with other stakeholders, notably betting operators, is critical to the success of that approach and the MoU with IBIA is therefore of particular importance. IBIA and its members bring a wealth of market and consumer data that will undoubtedly serve to significantly strengthen the information and intelligence gathering ability of the Unit.”\n\nThe International Betting Integrity Association is the leading global voice on integrity for the licensed betting industry. It is run by operators for operators, protecting its members from corruption through collective action. Its monitoring and alert platform is a highly effective anti-corruption tool that detects and reports suspicious activity on its members’ betting markets.\n\nThe association has longstanding information sharing partnerships with leading sports and gambling regulators to utilise its data and prosecute corruption. It represents the sector at high-level policy discussion forums such as the IOC, UN, Council of Europe and European Commission.\n\nThe agreement comes into force as of 19 December 2019.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The Malta Gaming Authority understands that it is far from being business as usual for operators in this sector and is thus increasing industry outreach as means to set regulatory expectations in these turbulent times.\n\nMost sporting events have now come to a complete halt, and so have the betting markets. This will naturally spur interest in betting operators to look elsewhere, including betting on events with different risk profiles to those traditionally offered. This includes betting on sporting events which are not run to the same professional degree as the more traditional sporting events on which betting is normally offered, including but not limited to amateur or minor league sports.\n\nEsports is one such betting market which may see a significant boost during these times. Even traditional sports and their respective governing bodies have resorted to esports, with some already hosting simulated versions of their events digitally. Just like other sports, esports has varying levels of professional, semi-professional and amateur tournaments, and whilst many esports events are organised in a highly professional manner, others may not. And in a new sector such as esports, this distinction may not be easy to make.\n\nIn order to safeguard the integrity of such events, and warn betting operators of the risks involved, the Malta Gaming Authority is therefore recommending the following:\n\nOperators should consider that all esports events are now being run online, and therefore lacking the standard integrity checks done at events.\nOperators should ensure that matches are not pre-recorded, and risk teams should be aware that esports matches are not always broadcast in real time, and there is often a pre-set delay between the actual match, and the public broadcast.\nOperators should make sure that customers understand the distinction between esports, and virtual sports, whereby the outcome of the latter is determined by a random number generator.\nOperators should look into whether tournaments benefit from integrity controls, and whether participants are professional, or otherwise, when deciding on which betting markets to offer.\nOperators should seek information about the participants/officials involved in the esports events from communicative tournament organisers or from publicly available information.\nOperators should maintain their betting integrity and fraud checks including making sure that participants/officials involved in esports events are not placing bets.\nTournament organisers, broadcasters and sports governing bodies (SGBs) should revise any policies regarding misuse of inside information so as to include also any participants or officials involved in their esports events.\nAny suspicious betting activity should be reported to the gambling regulator.\nAny other suspicious activity (not betting related) pertinent to an esports event should be reported to the corresponding SGB, and/or event organiser.\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The SvFF is the governing body for football in Sweden. The objective of the SvFF is to make sure that football in Sweden always adheres to laws and regulations that govern all sporting events and entities within their remit. Moreover, they constantly work towards making sure that football is a discrimination-free sport specifically at their national level.\n\nThis data-sharing agreement is the latest of a series of other high-profile agreements which have been signed by the MGA over the past few months, namely agreements with the Malta Football Association, the Tennis Integrity Unit, the International Cricket Council, and the International Olympic Committee to name a few. This fight against matching fixing and manipulation of sports relies on cooperation and effective exchange of information.\n\nThe MGA’s Sports Integrity Manager, Antonio Zerafa stated that, “The Data-Sharing Agreement between the MGA and the SvFF allows for the relationship between the two entities to not be limited to discussions of best practices only, but to also allow for the transfer of data in relation to investigations of manipulation in sports competitions. Undoubtedly, this further strengthens the MGA’s commitment to assisting Sports Governing Bodies in their fight against match-fixing.”\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The WPBSA is the regulatory authority for both Billiards and Snooker worldwide. It is responsible for the global development of both sports, and for the governance and integrity related to the sports. In addition WPBSA is also responsible for providing professional player support, as well as the development of coaches.\n\nNigel Mawer QPM, WPBSA’s Vice Chairman stated that “This is an important step forward in the battle against match-fixing and betting issues in snooker. I am really pleased to have the support of the MGA, and the MGA’s Sports Integrity team in combating corruption in sport.”\n\nThe MGA’s Sports Integrity Manager, Antonio Zerafa stated that “In these unprecedented times there has been a shift in focus from team sports to more individual sports. Hence, this period proved to be a perfect example of how stakeholders of sports and sports betting integrity need to widen their horizons in terms of collaboration. Our recent data-sharing agreement with the WPBSA places us in a position to be able to also assist individual sports in their fight against corruption.”\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Betfair joins a select group who have been honoured twice since the inception of the awards in 1966 and it means the company will be able to carry the Queen’s Award emblem for another five years.\n\nDavid Yu, Chief Executive of Betfair, said: “Upon winning our first award in 2003, our chairman and co-founder Edward Wray said that the company was looking forward to taking this great British innovation onto the global stage. Five years on, this award for International Trade is recognition of the strides we’ve made towards achieving that aim.”\n\n“Betfair continues to pride itself on its innovation, integrity, fairness to customers and a determination to work in partnership with international governments and regulators. Those qualities are being recognised throughout the world and we now have operational bases in Australia and Malta to support over one million registered customers.”\n\nWith this award, Betfair joins the likes of Rolls Royce, Weetabix, Aston Martin and James Dyson Ltd who have all been winners in the International Trade category in recent years.\n\nNotes to Editors:\n\nSince winning its first Queen’s award in 2003, Betfair has grown from 200 employees to over 1200 people in 2008, spread across its bases in Hammersmith, Stevenage, Malta and Australia. Driven by cutting-edge technology, Betfair enables customers to choose their own odds, even after an event has started. Betfair processes 5 million transactions a day, more than all of the European stock exchanges combined. Over half of all new customers now come from outside of the UK & Ireland.\n\nIn addition to the exchange, Betfair now has an established games portfolio. Betfair Poker, Betfair Games, Betfair Casino and Betfair’s accumulator products are hosted from Malta. It is an area that has seen significant growth and investment. The company is also developing new revenue streams by providing automated price feeds to third parties, establishing white-label exchanges and through its own Betfair Mobile product. In 2007, Betfair launched a new company, Tradefair, for those wishing to bet on financial markets.\n\nBetfair is a licensed betting operator in the UK, and also operates under licenses in Australia, Austria, Italy and Malta. The company is seeking licences elsewhere within the European Union and further afield. Betfair welcomes regulation and is committed to paying the appropriate product fees in every market in which it operates.\n\nWinners in the International Trade category for the Queen’s Award must demonstrate either “outstanding achievement… sustained over not less than three years, [or] continuous achievement in international trade, sustained over not less than six years”.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Operators and Service providers visiting the LGA stand also had the opportunity to ask for relevant information with respect to the Maltese Jurisdiction, whereby a Malta Enterprise official was also present to provide overview information with respect to Malta’s business environment.\n\nCommenting on the outcome of the expo, which was held between the 26th and 28th January 2010 at Earl’s Court in London, an LGA spokesperson said that “the outcome was extremely positive and beyond our expectations. The LGA’s stand was one of the busiest, with the stand also attracting extensive press coverage from different countries.  The huge influx of visitors to the LGA stand re-confirms that serious operators want to be licensed in a jurisdiction that offers the highest levels of checks, controls and player protection, but which is also business friendly”.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

It was an honour that LGA officials were specifically requested to share the Malta experiences in this field to the global gaming community, whilst London’s ICE EXPO also served as a meeting place for regulators to share experiences, with LGA’s management attending and having a series of meetings with other regulators “\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

A large number of queries were also directed towards the upcoming regulatory framework covering Digital Games with Prize.

In March 2022, a Concession agreement was signed to this effect between the Ministry for the Economy, European Funds and Lands and National Lottery PLC. Pursuant to the Concession Agreement, the National Lottery licence was issued by the Authority and shall be valid for a ten-year term. The operation of the National Lottery shall be subject to the regulation and supervision of the Authority.\n\nWhilst addressing the event, the Minister for the Economy, European Funds and Lands, Silvio Schembri said “I’m sure that the new National Lottery licensee shall continue to enhance the popular National Lottery Games, such as the Lotto and Super 5, among others, as well as introduce other games which will further enrich the games portfolio. Together, we have ensured that National Lottery PLC will be committed to promoting, designing and putting into practice the principles of actively responsible gaming, while protecting the personal well-being of players. The national economic profit that translates from gambling should be given importance, but not at the expense of the player.\n\nCarl Brincat, MGA CEO said “The Authority is confident that the Concessionaire shall dedicate all resources necessary to maintain the very highest level of operational and compliance standards, and as has already been made clear, will invest in taking care of its players and doing its utmost to avoid gaming-related harm.”\n\n“Today marks a new era for the National Lottery of Malta. The licence attained from the Malta Gaming Authority affirms the hard work that we have been undertaking and our commitment to deliver an innovative, forward looking and above all, fair and transparent, national lottery service” said Johann Schembri, CEO of National Lottery PLC.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Users will now be met with two distinct timelines when accessing the LRMS: the ‘Company Portfolio’ and the ‘Personal Portfolio’.\n\nAs part of the Personal Portfolio implementation, the Personal Declaration Form (PDF) (known as the “Change in Personal Details” application), will no longer be accessible through the Company Portfolio. The application will instead be located under the Personal Portfolio application menu (NEW/CHANGE) and will allow the user to create and submit the PDF.\n\nMoreover, a “Request for Involvement Approval” application will be introduced. This application will be automatically created on the Company Portfolio’s timeline. This will be the case when the user links the involvement with an already licensed operator (otherwise, the involvement approval will be in the Involvement step within the Gaming Licence Application. These involvements will be created on the submission of the Change in Personal Details application.  This application will allow anyone with access rights to the Company Portfolio to approve or reject any involvement requests. The approval or rejection of the roles would signify the finalisation of the Company’s responsibilities, and henceforth, the MGA will be required to proceed with the final steps of the process.\n\nThe Authority has created tutorial videos in this regard, which can be accessed through the following link. These videos show:\n\nHow to switch between the portal timelines\nHow to create a new PDF and add a new involvement\nHow to accept or reject a Request for Involvement application\nHow to accept or reject a Request for Involvement within a Gaming Licence Application\n\nIntroduction of e-ID login\n\nFurther to the above changes, the Authority has also introduced the e-ID login on the MGA’s LRMS. Therefore, anyone holding a Maltese e-ID may opt to access the LRMS by using the e-ID login details.\n\nIt is important to note that if an individual does not have the login details but is aware that a PDF has already been created on the portal, the individual should kindly contact the Authority to access the form.\n\nKindly contact our support team at [email protected] should you require any further information.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The amendment consists in the lowering of the existing minimum RTP percentage (applicable to operators offering their games online) from ninety-two per cent (92%) to eighty-five per cent (85%).\n\nThe MGA recognises that responsible decision-making necessitates the consideration of feedback provided by industry stakeholders and therefore, during May 2021 the Authority carried out a closed consultation to better assess the viability of the proposed change to the minimum RTP threshold. The consultation process involved a number of industry stakeholders, namely, consultants, Business-to-Consumer operators and Business-to-Business operators. The consultation process enabled the Authority to gain a better understanding of the views adopted by the consultation participants in terms of optimal RTP percentage and possible implications resulting from the change to the minimum RTP threshold on their product offering, operations, and competitive position. In addition, the MGA also carried out a comparative analysis on the applicability of the RTP percentages that one may find in selected jurisdictions throughout the European Union (‘EU’) and outside of the EU. A summary of the outcome of the consultation as well as the research carried out by the MGA can be found in the attached Policy Paper on the Amending the Return to Player Minimum Percentage, which is being published in parallel with the amendments to the Directive.\n\nIn line with its commitment to protect consumers, especially minors and vulnerable persons, the MGA shall be publishing further amendments to the Directive in due course.\n\nAll licensees are reminded that the game rules must be readily available to the player. Those offering the service online must ensure that the game rules are to be displayed in full no more than one click away from the page on which the game can be played. With respect to games which are played after being downloaded and installed on a compatible device, licensees shall also ensure that the game rules shall be made present to the player in any case prior to the player’s first wager on the game. For the avoidance of any doubt, this requirement is equally applicable to mobile sites and to mobile device applications.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The workshops’ objective is to introduce a more regular and structured touchpoint between industry stakeholders and the MGA and to encourage an informal exchange of views around regulatory topics of mutual interest. In the coming weeks, the Authority will be inviting interested stakeholders to participate in the first workshop that will be held in December 2022.\n\nThe ongoing consultation shall give the opportunity to such stakeholders to submit their feedback, if any, regarding the proposed Policy. The consultation period shall run until 14 December 2022.\n\nKindly contact the Authority on [email protected] with any queries or feedback regarding the consultation.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The Authority is also issuing a new System Review Checklist, which will be used after licence issuance, to verify that the implemented systems operated by the Licensee reflect the information submitted to the Authority, as well as being in line with the requirements emanating from the Gaming Act and any other relevant subsidiary legislations. Both documents may be accessed from the ‘Downloads’ section.\n\nThe revised Audit Checklist builds on the previous version, however, it also takes into consideration the requirements from the revised System Documentation Checklist, and omits any requirements that were inefficient or obsolete. The Audit Checklist has been split into 4 separate checklists to cater for the differing B2C, B2C with DLT, B2B and B2B Software needs.\n\nAlthough applicants are urged to refer to the revised Audit Checklist where possible, the revised requirements will come into force for any System Audits engaged as of 1 January 2023.\n\nSystem Reviews will also be carried out by the approved Audit Service Providers (the ‘ASPs’), similar to the System and Compliance Audits processes. The System Review should be carried out on the live environment, and the Licensee’s personnel should be available to demonstrate functionality and provide evidence and information as per the list of checks provided.\n\nSystem Reviews will generally be required one year after issuance of a new licence, or within a shorter time frame if a system audit was not required at licence issuance stage. A Licensee might be asked to undergo a System Review in any other instances that the Authority decides upon.\n\nAudit Service Providers conducting System Audit and/or System Reviews should submit feedback though the Authority’s CRM system, or otherwise, as instructed by the Authority. The checklists have been structured in a way to better guide ASPs and Licensees on the checks applicable per licence type. However, the ASP is free to conduct and include feedback on other additional checks that are deemed relevant to the Audit. This is especially so in the cases of B2B licence providers offering both management and/or control of the games, as well as that of the back-end software. In such instances, the different checks from both B2B tabs might be relevant and would need to be conducted.\n\nIn case of any checks which are deemed to be as not applicable, the ASP needs to provide the rationale behind this decision, as well as any supporting evidence.\n\nKindly contact our support team at [email protected] should you require any further information.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

By working together, both regulators seek to reinforce their commitment to ensuring the highest standards of player protection and fair play within their respective jurisdictions.\n\nThe regulators also emphasised the importance of information sharing in relation to sports betting integrity, AML/CFT and compliance.\n\nThe MGA also shared the experience gained through the sandbox environment that had been launched for the use of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLTs) and the acceptance of cryptocurrencies by gaming operators. This resulted in a dedicated policy that was published earlier in the year.\n\nMeanwhile, the UKGC shared the latest progress on the UK’s Gambling Act White Paper.\n\nThe two regulators also discussed formalising their relationship through a Memorandum of Understanding.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Following feedback received through the dedicated consultation process, the Authority is hereby publishing these amendments with the aim of strengthening and clarifying the current player protection framework.\n\nThis framework will support the Authority’s initiatives moving forward and will facilitate the Authority’s plans to continuously improve the player protection framework, including the eventual publication of detailed player protection guidelines for licensees. The Authority is in the process of conducting detailed research and garnering expert experience to serve as the foundation for the eventual publication of such guidelines.\n\nThe amendments delve into, inter alia, the licensees’ obligations regarding their responsible gaming policies and procedures, and the introduction of markers of harm that must be considered by licensees when determining effective measures and processes to detect and address problem gambling. Provisions relating to real-money reinforcement and staff training have also been addressed via the amendments.\n\nThe amendments are being proposed on the basis of a review of the key sections of the Directive carried out by an expert in the field, and on the basis of the Authority’s own research and experience garnered through the Responsible Gaming Unit’s audits and familiarisation visits.\n\nSubject to the transitory provisions of the Directive, the amendments shall come into force on 12 January 2023.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Pace, chairperson, said: “Carl has made extensive contributions to the Malta Gaming Authority and to the gaming industry in Malta and we are confident in, and very thankful for, the strong foundation he leaves behind as we continue to pursue the MGA’s strategic goals.”\n\nDr Brincat said: “Leaving the MGA is a very hard decision to make. The past 9 years have been a rollercoaster of experiences which contributed to the person I am today, and it has been a privilege to lead the Authority for the past 3 years. Looking back, I am proud of the work that we have done together, and of the highly motivated team that surrounds me at the Authority. I look forward to continuing to deliver our commitments over my final few months, and have no doubt that my successor will find that the fantastic team at the MGA can help him or her continue to drive improvement further. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for the Authority.”\n\nAs part of the senior leadership succession plan, the Board will be issuing a public call for applications for the position of Chief Executive Officer over the coming days to cater for a smooth transition from Dr Brincat to his successor. The chosen successor shall spend a number of weeks shadowing Dr Brincat before commencing his or her term on 26 January 2024.\n\nThe MGA remains dedicated to strengthening this vital sector in Malta and unlocking new opportunities for innovation and excellence.\n\nOutgoing CEO Carl Brincat\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

It should be noted that the Authorised Person did not appeal the Authority’s decision to suspend the licence.\n\nDespite being granted ample time to address the breaches mentioned above, the Authorised Person has failed to both rectify its position and cooperate with the Authority. All attempts to communicate with the Authorised Person following November 2022 have been rendered futile. The breaches have continued to persist to date.\n\nIn addition to the payment of the outstanding licence fee outlined within the Notice, the Authorised Person’s licence fee for the year 2023 fell due on 13 June 2023 during the Suspension’s operative period. Hence, an additional twenty-five thousand Euro (€25,000) is considered due to the Authority in this regard. Therefore, the Authorised Person owes the Authority fifty-thousand Euros (€50,000) in annual licence fees for the licence periods commencing on 13 June 2022 and 13 June 2023, respectively.\n\nPursuant to the above, the Authority is hereby notifying the Authorised Person that the Authorisation bearing the number ‘MGA/ B2C/425/2017’ (the ‘Authorisation’) is hereby being cancelled in terms of the Regulations. The foregoing decision has been taken pursuant to the grounds mentioned in the aforementioned Notice.\n\nFurther to the above considerations, the Authorised Person is hereby being directed to:\n\nDuly notify the players, if any, of the cancellation of the Authorisation. Such notification should be effected by means of the Authorised Person’s website/s, as well as via electronic mail.\n\nMoreover, such notification shall include, but shall not be limited to, the manner in which such registered players are to withdraw any funds held by the Authorised Person on their behalf; \n\nProvide the necessary guidance and assistance to the players in relation to the procedures that shall be applied by the Authorised Person further to the remittal of outstanding player balances;\n\nFurther to sections 1 and 2 above, the Authorised Person shall:\n\na.

All B2C licensees shall put into effect a written procedure for handling player disputes, and this procedure shall be made readily available to the players, and included within the general terms & conditions.

In such event where the suspicious betting behaviour takes place via accounts not falling within the remits of the MGA licence, the MGA expects licensees to report the said activity just the same (even though the MGA is aware that such operators are unable to share the corresponding betting data).\n\nAs part of the SBI’s Alerting process, the MGA will share knowledge regarding the suspicious betting reports received with its licensees without revealing the source of the information. The MGA expects that licensees will be able to review (or re-review) the betting activity surrounding the event being indicated in the alert, as this will increase the odds in recognising any suspicious behaviour (if there is any). If suspicious betting is recorded by an operator after receiving an alert, then the suspicious event in question is to be reported via the Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism.\n\nThe reporting instrument to be used for reporting purposes between licensees that offer a gaming service and/or a critical gaming supply, and the Authority is the Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism via access through the MGA’s Licensee Portal. Therefore, all licensees reporting suspicious events shall make use of this instrument to report. Licensees that offer sports betting (Business-to-Customer Type 2) are expected to provide the corresponding betting data that falls under the MGA’s remit at the reporting stage. If such betting data does not fall under the MGA’s remit, the licensee is expected to highlight under which jurisdiction such betting data falls, in the report itself. Moreover, licensees that offer a critical gaming supply (Business-to-Business) are not expected to provide any betting data when reporting suspicious events, as the MGA is aware that such licensees are unable to provide such information.\n\nRequest for Information (corresponded by the Authority to operators)\n\nThe MGA may, in certain circumstances, request its licensees to provide information subject to a set deadline. Such request will be corresponded formally and via email. In these instances, the Authority may be interested in knowing which authorised persons offered bets on a sporting event whilst also detailing the information required.\n\nIn such cases, disclosure to the MGA is necessary for the prevention or detection of crime as well as for reasons of substantial public interest. Where necessary, the exchange of information must be carried out without tipping off, so as not to prejudice any ongoing investigation. In doing so, the operator’s systems should be designed in such a way as to ensure compliance with relevant data protection legislation. Operators are obliged to reply to such emails.\n\nMore information regarding Suspicious Betting Reporting Requirements and Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism can be found through the SBRM Manual.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Prior to February 2004, all National Lottery Games, namely the Lotto, Super 5 and the Grand Lottery fell under the responsibility of the Public Lotto Department. Today, the operation of the National Lottery is supervised and regulated by the Malta Gaming Authority (the “MGA”/ the “Authority”), which is the entity responsible to ensure that all such operations are conducted in accordance with the Authority’s legislative framework.\n\nIn February 2004, Maltco Lotteries Limited was awarded an exclusive National Lottery Licence to operate the National Lottery of Malta by the Authority, known at the time as the Lotteries and Gaming Authority. This licence was extended in 2012 following an international public tender won by Maltco for the Concession for the Rights of the National Lottery of Malta (the ‘Concession’) and expired on 04 July 2022.\n\nFollowing another international public tender in 2021 for the rights to operate the National Lottery, the Maltese company National Lottery plc was granted the Concession by the Ministry for the Economy, European Funds and Lands, in March 2022, and was subsequently awarded the National Lottery Licence by the Authority on 05 July 2022, thus enabling the former to take over the operation of the National Lottery in Malta from the previous operator, Maltco Lotteries Limited. The National Lottery Licence shall be valid for a ten-year term until July 2032 and the MGA shall regulate and supervise the operations of National Lottery plc as the National Lottery Licensee.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

These premises need to be operated by a licensed B2C Licensee, whereby the licensee needs to obtain relevant approvals for every premise/s that the Licensee intends to operate from. The Gaming Premises Regulations deal with physical player interfaces within dedicated premises, having access controls and self-exclusion mechanisms, together with limitations on the locations thereof. These premises do not include premises that are offered by virtue of a government concession or premises offering solely tombola games.\n\nIn accordance with the Gaming Premises Regulations, in order for premises to be approved as Controlled Gaming Premises, the relevant Planning Authority permit for the appropriate class must be issued. In anticipation of having to file such an application with the Planning Authority, a prospective applicant may request from the Malta Gaming Authority a certificate to the effect that it does not, prima facie, object to such premises being used as Controlled Gaming Premises.\n\nOnce the Planning Authority issues the relevant permit, the applicant would then need to forward the relevant paperwork to the Malta Gaming Authority to be reviewed, and the issuance of the Controlled Gaming Premises Certificate.\n\nSimilar to other physical premises, Controlled Gaming Premises are subject to the scrutiny of the MGA’s inspectors, who are present within the physical premises on a frequent basis in order to ensure that the games are run fairly and according to law.\n\nOnce a licence is awarded, several ‘gaming verticals’, meaning categories of products that require specific safeguards per vertical, can be offered under the same licence.

Fitness and propriety shall be assessed mainly on two principal criteria, that shall be taken into consideration by the Authority both during and subsequent to the application stage. These criteria deal with the applicant’s integrity, honesty and reputation, as well as their competence and capability.\n\nHow to Apply\n\nThe Personal Declaration Form, together with the MLRO Eligibility Form in the case of Key AML applicants, need to be filled in specifically by the individuals themselves in the personal timeline within the Licensee Portal. In the Personal timeline, the Change in Personal Details application specifically in “Step 3 Involvement Type”  is to be used to request the relevant involvement with the company.\n\nUpon the submission of the Change in Personal Details application, the Request for Involvement is shown in the company timeline or within a draft application, and persons with the necessary access to the company will approve/decline the request (refer to video).

The report provides a review of the Authority’s accomplishments for the first half of 2023, together with a description of the Maltese gaming industry’s performance over the same period. The latter provides a medium-term outlook towards the future, as well as an analysis outlining important statistics for the land-based and online gaming industries.\n\nSupervisory Activities\nBetween January and June 2023, the Authority conducted 14 compliance audits, and 85 desktop reviews. The Commercial Communications Committee also issued a total of three Letters of Breach, whereby operators were found to be in breach of the Gaming Commercial Communications Regulations (S.L. 583.09). The Authority issued 23 warnings, cancelled four licences, and suspended another five, following information which emerged from supervisory activities. Furthermore, the MGA issued a total of nine administrative penalties as well as one regulatory settlement, with a collective total financial penalty of €124,400.\nThe MGA also carried out 11 Compliance Examinations on behalf of the FIAU. During the same period, the FIAU imposed administrative penalties on three licensees based on violations discovered during examinations carried out in previous years. In total, these amounted to €599,420.\nA total of 545 criminal probity screening checks were undertaken on personnel, shareholders, ultimate beneficial owners, key individuals, employees, and businesses from the land-based and online gaming sectors. A number of these were escalated to the Fit & Proper Committee, which during the period in review determined that four individuals and entities did not meet the Authority’s fit and properness criteria. The Supervisory Council also rejected one licence application on the same basis.\nIn the first half of the year, 19 interviews with prospective MLROs and key persons carrying out the AML/CFT function were carried out with the aim of determining the knowledge and suitability of each candidate.\nIn its efforts to safeguard players and promote responsible gaming, the Authority assisted a total of 2,216 players who requested assistance, covering the majority of the cases received during 2023 and the spillover from 2022. Furthermore, 40 responsible gambling website checks were conducted to ensure that licensees are duly protecting their players as required by law, and 16 observation letters were issued identifying areas of improvement.\nA total of 11 cases of websites having misleading references to the Authority were investigated, while a total of six notices were published on the MGA’s website with the aim of preventing the public from falling victim to such scams.\nNational and International Cooperation\nEnforcement agencies, sports governing bodies, integrity units, and other regulatory authorities made a total of 12 requests for information, specifically in relation to the manipulation of sporting events or violations of sporting regulations. Subsequently, these requests resulted in 17 data exchanges. In addition, 166 allegations of suspicious betting from licensees and other interested parties were received.\nBetween January and June 2023, a total of 118 alerts on suspicious betting were sent to the industry. Following further correspondence of these alerts to the industry, the Authority received a total of 12 new suspicious betting reports through the Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism.\nThe Authority participated directly in six separate investigations into sports rules violations or manipulation of sporting competitions during the time under review. A direct investigation implies that the report came from MGA licensed operators, and thus betting data was shared. In addition, the Authority also participated indirectly in another five investigations, where the events reported formed part of another jurisdiction, but concerned Maltese players.\nThe Authority sent 23 requests for international cooperation, relating to requests for background checks as part of an authorisation process. Furthermore, the Authority received a total of 37 requests for international collaboration from other regulators.\nBy the end of June 2023, a further 53 official replies were issued, providing feedback on the regulatory good standing of our licensed operators to the relevant authorities asking for this information.\nIn total, during the first six months of the year, the MGA received 45 requests for information from other local regulating authorities and governing bodies.\n\nThe MGA will publish a full-year industry performance report during the second half of 2024, when it publishes its Annual Report for the financial year ending 31 December 2023.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

We have been working not only to supervise the gaming industry, but also to nurture it, to foster a space where operators can thrive, while ensuring that the welfare of society remains paramount. Our ESG Code represents our commitment to this,” Dr Brincat said.\n\nMGA CEO Carl Brincat\nEconomy Minister Silvio Schembri\nPolicy and International Affairs Chief Kinga Warda\n\nMinister for the Economy, EU Funds and Lands Silvio Schembri said that the aim of the press conference was to highlight the importance for the remote gaming sector to voluntarily use the ESG tool that is increasingly shaping the business and investment landscape, as well as our approach to social and environmental challenges.\n\n“All businesses should embrace tools to reduce risk and transform successfully, and when it comes to remote gaming, one of the tools is using ESG metrics.\n\n“The ESG code will serve as an instrument for self-regulation, helping remote gaming companies align with best practices and maintain a position that allows them to effectively meet the evolving expectations of key stakeholders in the sector,” Minister Schembri said.\n\nThe ESG Code, unveiled today, is the culmination of a journey that involved four extensive stages: the peer review and research phase, materiality assessment, stakeholder interviews and licensees’ consultations. This extensive process has resulted in a final Code that is well-informed and reflective of the industry’s ESG priorities and stakeholder expectations.\n\nKey Features of the ESG Code – a Balanced Approach\n\nThe Code identifies 19 ESG topics, derived from the materially assessment, organised into three categories: Environmental, Social and Governance, providing a strategic framework for remote gaming companies to focus their reporting efforts effectively.\n\nTwo Tiers of Reporting: The MGA will recognise companies’ efforts with two levels of reporting, Tier 1, a basic ESG standard, and Tier 2, a more aspirational level, to ensure sustainability efforts are focused and impactful.\nFlexible approach for certain disclosures: Core disclosures have been defined, while reporting entities will have the flexibility to choose optional disclosures;\nStreamlined Reporting: The Code includes several ESG disclosures already required under existing reporting frameworks to streamline reporting and reduce administrative burden; and\nFocus on ESG reporting: The emphasis is on ESG reporting, rather than setting specific ESG targets.\nAn MGA ESG Code Approval Seal\n\nIndustry consultation revealed a strong desire for formal recognition by the MGA. To meet this demand, the MGA ESG Code Approval Seal will be awarded to entities that report under this Code, showcasing their commitment to ESG. Different seals will be awarded to entities that meet Tier 1 or Tier 2 reporting requirements.\n\nHow the ESG Code will Work in Practice\n\nThe Code will be a standalone voluntary submission, separate from other ESG disclosures made by the reporting entity to the MGA or other bodies. Reporting will be confidential, and the MGA will launch an online tool to facilitate the process. Additionally, the ESG Code will align reporting periods with the financial year of reporting entities. The inaugural reporting year will commence in 2023, with the submission deadline set for the third quarter of 2024.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe MGA’s ESG Code of Good Practice is a crucial step in advancing the sustainability and responsibility of the remote gaming industry in Malta. This achievement represents a significant milestone in our journey, and we are enthusiastic about the positive impact it will have on the gaming industry and our stakeholders.\n\nAlongside the Code, we are also publishing a Consultation feedback document that highlights the comprehensive feedback received from our licensees during the development of the ESG framework.\n\nClick here to access the full ESG Code of Good Practice.\n\nClick here to access the Consultation feedback document.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The DRA is responsible for writing and overseeing the regulations in relation to darts within both the professional and amateur ranks.\n\nThe DRA’s Chairman, Nigel Mawer QPM, stated that “The DRA performs an important role in keeping darts safe from corruption and match-fixing. This new partnership with the MGA will go a long way towards helping the DRA protect the sport. It sends a clear message that the DRA has the worldwide ability to detect and prosecute players who breach the Betting Rules and damage the sport.”\n\nThe MGA’s Sports Integrity Manager, Antonio Zerafa stated that “The COVID-19 pandemic altered the very foundations of sports betting. However, these unprecedented circumstances did not diminish our ambitions towards meeting and partnering with new sport governing bodies such as DRA. Through this agreement which the Authority has signed, we are very much looking forward to helping the DRA fulfil their obligation to investigate cases of sports betting-related corruption.”\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The reason for this regulatory update is to bring Maltese regulations at par with current industry practices.\n\n“We have always assured our licensees that the Maltese regulatory regime on remote gaming will reflect the exigencies of the industry. The update maps out our response to the ever changing landscape of the remote gaming business” says Mario Galea, CEO of The Lotteries and Gaming Authority. The fact that the original version of the regulation was just published in May 2004, but since then the industry has seen a number of changes especially in the poker and skill games markets and a new breed of business models which change the methods of interaction between licensees and service providers. The aim of the update is to broaden further the concept of game neutral and technology neutral licensing and to facilitate more the uptake of regulated intermediaries. The regulations also introduce some new concepts, such as the recognition and approval of organisations that can offer on-line support to compulsive players. Organisations that can aid compulsive on-line players are now a reality and the Authority wants to actively ensure that licensees in Malta will be able to offer reliable assistance to their players. The Authority will co-ordinate a system that allows compulsive players to bar themselves from all operators in Malta for a specified period of time.\n\nThe LGA has commissioned the Malta Remote Gaming Council for the management of the public consultation process. “We want the MRGC to lead the consultation process to stress the point that the regulatory update reflects the needs of the industry.” says Dr. Zammit Maempel, Chairman of the LGA. The Council was set up in March 2005 as a trade group involving licensees and local service providers in the remote gaming industry.\n\nA copy of the amended Remote Gaming Regulations can be downloaded from the LGA website, www.lga.org.mt. The public consultation period ends November 16th 2005.\n\nThe Remote Gaming Regulations were published in May 2004 and since then have attracted a number of operators to Malta. Projections show that by the end of 2005, Malta will have over 100 licensed operators in various classes of remote gaming.\n\nEUROPEANCEO INTERVIEWS LOTTERIES AND GAMING AUTHORITY CHIEF EXECUTIVE\n\nThe latest issue of the influential International Magazine, EuropeanCEO carried an interview with the Lotteries and Gaming Authority Chief Executive, Mr Mario Galea.\n\nThe special issue included a survey of the on-line gaming market in which Malta was featured as a reputable jurisdiction that regulates this industry.\n\nThe publication which is targeted to top level management and decision making executives with a circulation of more than 45,000 copies, outlined Malta’s involvement in this particular industry and its importance within the European dimension.\n\nThe article also outlines the phenomenal growth of the Maltese jurisdiction during the past year and mentions the overwhelming response of remote gaming operators to be licensed in Malta.\n\nThe report focused on the ability of the Lotteries and Gaming Authority in transcending the regulatory limitations of brick and mortar gaming, and transforming them to high-tech media.\n\nThe article stresses that as an EU member state, Malta has harmonised regulations and services with the rest of the other member states, however the island remains the only one with a complete regulatory regime for on-line gaming.\n\nFurthermore, the feature portrays the regulations as pragmatic which focus on the importance of player protection and the promotion of responsible gaming.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The survey covered a number of different areas, including impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Gaming Revenue (GR) or revenue, operating costs and investments. It also focused on the industry concerns and actions taken by operators during this pandemic.\n\nThe results show that the worst hit sector is projected to be the B2C sector, in particular the operators exposed to Type 2 game types. Indeed, the GR for this sector is projected to be 40% lower than that projected in earlier budgets for the same full year 2020. Most of the operators are considering postponing investment plans for a later date, subject to a notable degree of uncertainty. The key highlights from this survey are presented below.\n\nThe MGA will continue following closely the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and further surveys aimed as assessing other impacts will also be conducted.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The Slovak Football Association is the governing body of football in Slovakia and is one of the largest organisations in Slovakia with more than 400,000 members.\n\nThe MGA’s Sports Integrity Manager, Antonio Zerafa stated, “The agreement with the Slovak Football Association joins a continuously growing list of data-sharing agreements with international partners from the sporting world. We are proud that through such agreements we are placing ourselves as an important contributor to match-fixing investigations across the globe, and we hope that we can now provide the same level of assistance to the Slovak FA also.”\n\nJakub Čavoj, Integrity Officer of the Slovak Football Association stated, “I hope that this agreement will be very useful for both sides and help us achieve a common goal – protecting the integrity of sport competitions.  For the Slovak FA and police investigations this exchange of information could be important in collecting evidence because many betting companies popular in Slovakia have a Malta gambling license. Sharing best practice and exchange of information is key in the fight against match-fixing.”\n\nThis agreement will facilitate the sharing of information between the two parties, in fulfilment of the requirements at law.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The LGA will continue to use its own methodologies in conducting due diligence investigations on all applicants to decide on their suitability as licensees and to review other appropriate areas addressing player protection and responsible operator conduct.\n\nThe discussions follow investigations by the LGA in a search for optimum testing and operational systems. Malta is a full member of the European Union.\n\nThe agreement will potentially apply to a wide range of online casinos and poker rooms, comprising a significant proportion of the available business. Malta numbers 71 online gambling sites as licensees, and there are 76 major Internet venues carrying the eCOGRA “Play It Safe” seal.\n\nThere will also be more cooperation between the two bodies on player disputes to ensure that these are heard fairly, independently and within a reasonable timeframe. The LGA has its own compliance and disputes officer and eCOGRA offers a dedicated dispute mediation service through its Fair Gaming Advocate.\n\nFurther discussions will now detail the finer points of cooperation and consistency between the requirements of the two bodies, based on an acceptance of common principles of honesty and efficiency in the interests of player protection.\n\nMario Galeo, the chief executive responsible for Malta licensing says that he is pleased with the agreement reached with eCOGRA and looks forward to close cooperation and communication in the interest of creating better conditions in the online gambling industry.\n\n“We share a common purpose in seeking to ensure that the player is given fair gaming and efficient, courteous service by casinos and poker rooms that are licensed and regulated by our respective bodies,” he said. “We look forward to a closer working relationship that benefits both the players and the industry in the years ahead.”\n\nThe CEO of eCOGRA, Andrew Beveridge said he was delighted that the LGA had approved the testing procedures and operating standards that his organisation had introduced for the “Play It Safe” seal operations.\n\n“eCOGRA is keen to interact with any jurisdiction that shares our values and we regard this closer relationship with the LGA as a significant step toward consistent global regulation for safe online gambling,” he said.\n\nThe agreement follows a similar collaborative arrangement with the Kahnawake licensing jurisdiction in Canada, which was signed late last year by the directors of the Kahnawake Gaming Commission and eCOGRA.\n\neCOGRA has announced that the growing interaction between major regulatory and standards authorities is broadly aimed at achieving wider consistency across geographical borders in regard to requirements and standards concerning online casino and poker room relations with the player community.\n\nAbout eCOGRA\n\neCOGRA, the independent standards authority for the online gaming industry, is committed to protecting online casino and poker players around the world. The non-profit organization addresses the most important issues to players: fast payouts, fair gaming, responsive and efficient service and responsible operator conduct.\n\neCOGRA provides an international framework of best operational and player practice requirements enforced through inspections, reviews, and continuous monitoring by independent global audit companies. To date, 76 sites comply with these requirements and have been awarded the coveted “Play It Safe” Seal that identifies to players the safest online gaming sites on the Web.

In this regard, the Authority’s Sports Betting Integrity department continuously seeks ways of improving monitoring and reporting capabilities across the wider Maltese sports betting sector. In that light, the Authority’s Sports Betting Integrity department has the below updates to share.\n\nOn 1 October 2021, the Authority implemented the following changes:\n\nUpdating of the Suspicious Betting Reporting Requirements\n\nThe Authority has revised the Suspicious Betting Reporting Requirements and commencing from 1 October 2021 the requirements now include licensees that offer a critical gaming supply relating to betting on sports events. This means that now, both licensees that offer a gaming service and/or a critical gaming supply relating to betting on sports events must notify the Authority of any instance relating to suspicious betting.\nSuspicious Betting Alerting Process\nThe Sports Betting Integrity department started alerting its licensees with any knowledge of suspicious betting activity in its possession. Without revealing the source of the information, the Authority started informing its licensees of any instances of suspicious betting activity in relation to any event that has been adverted by such.\n\nHow does this new alerting process help the Operator?\n\nEnsures that MGA licensed operators are aware of suspicious betting activities known within the MGA’s radar.\nAllows MGA licensed operators to review their own monitoring systems and verify that they have not been subject to similar activities.\nIncreases awareness of suspicious betting risks being faced across the Maltese betting sector.\n\nHow does this new alerting process help the Authority?\n\nBetter and wider monitoring of suspicious betting activity taking place within the Maltese betting sector.\nHolistic review and evaluation of the sports betting risks faced by the sector at large.\nAllows for a more informed Maltese betting sector, further bridging together the Authority and its licensees in their collective fight against corruption in sports and sports betting.\n\nThe Authority’s Sports Betting Integrity department reminds all interested parties to continuously refer to the Guidance Paper on the Suspicious Betting Reporting Requirements & Other Sports Integrity Matters for direction on all matters relating to the Authority’s sports integrity endeavours and the roles and responsibilities of its licensees.\n\nThe Authority also welcomes all who are interested to know more about the department’s role in safeguarding the integrity of sports and sports betting to contact them via email.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Personally, I regard this as a milestone as I believe that such platforms have a lot of information that they can bring to the table to help prevent and investigate such crimes.”\n\nThe conference was held on the 19th of October in Strasbourg.\n\nPhoto credit: Council of Europe\n\n \n\n \n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Tonio Fenech, Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Finance, on the occasion of the Open-Day held for the recruitment of personnel in the i-gaming industry.\n\nI am delighted to be opening this career opportunities event for the i-gaming industry. My virtual presence works out with an industry that is entirely based on means of distance communications!\n\nIt gives me great satisfaction to see such an event being organized by the private industry for this business sector. It demonstrates that our government’s long term strategy has been successful and now its bearing fruit, Eight years ago we felt that Malta should become a centre of excellence for Information Technology and embarked on a project to identify which industries would best suit our economy, size and infrastructure. It was not an easy task remembering that this was in the time of the so called ‘dot-com boom’ crash. However as international markets continued to fall it became clear that e-commerce was a realistic economy that could develop into global proportions. Malta chose to take up Remote gaming as it fledgling on-line market, but with strong players who had experience of the same business in the real world.\n\nGovernment’s objectives to attract such operators to Malta were not simply to generate direct revenues from taxation. As part of its ICT strategy, government wanted Malta’s IT infrastructure to grow bringing job opportunities for young Maltese people who were being encouraged to take up high-value careers. For this we invested more in our education system at post secondary level to include specialty ICT courses at MCAST and University, whilst at the same time embarking on a strategy introduce IT at all levels of our education system.\n\nCombined with other initiatives, our aim is to make Malta a center of excellence in ICT which in itself will helps to attract international operators who are either directly user of ICT, or require support services as part of their business function.\n\nThe Remote Gaming industry in Malta is a prime example of ICT direct users. This industry requires leading edge e-commerce technologies and resources. The fact that operators continue to invest in Malta as part of their growth strategy demonstrated that the island has scaled well with the exigencies of the industry both in terms of availability of infrastructure and skilled human resources.\n\nThe key success factors for Malta’s remote gaming industry can be summed up in three words: Responsible, Responsive and Reliable. Malta took a bold step from the out-set to introduce remote gaming regulations that were far superior than any other jurisdiction in terms of strict licensing procedures, strong monitoring controls and player protection mechanism. We did not want Malta to become a nation of convenience for unscrupulous operators. In the long term this decision paid well since as the industry grew, operators realized that their success was dependent on their regulatory jurisdiction’s reputation a serious regulator.\n\nHaving good regulations is not good enough unless you have somebody to enforce it. This is why the lotteries and gaming authorities invested in human resources and technologies to be able to carry out its duties as the regulatory body on remote gaming. Being receptive to the exigencies of the operators and players is demonstrates a high level of commitment from the Regulator and which is expected in such a high-risk industry.\n\nWith over 160 applications for a remote gaming license of which 90 having already established their business, its clear that this industry is here to stay.\n\nToday there already over 600 people working locally with remote gaming operators and many more in the supporting services industry. As more operators establish here, more human resources will be required and this is why we regarding this event as important. It gives an opportunity to the public to see what i-gaming can offer as a career in its diverse functions.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Dalli, Business Development Executive at CSB highlighted. “The main aim is to introduce potential Maltese employees to the career opportunities that the iGaming industry opens for them. iGaming is a relatively new but booming market in Malta, and so the careers it offers are fast-paced, flexible, dynamic and professional, along with an international exposure. It also pays better than average salaries.”\n\nRita Calleja, Human Resources and Administration Manager at the LGA commented; “We have planned this event with CSB and embarked on a holistic marketing campaign in order to promote career opportunities in one of the fastest growing industries in Malta. Such event also shows the commitment of the Authority in sending a positive message across to iGaming companies and career seekers. In addition, this event should also help the public understand better what iGaming is all about.”\n\nA number of iGaming operators will be setting up stands at the Corinthia San Gorg Hotel in order to meet the public and demonstrate the operational aspect of working in an iGaming company. Furthermore, a number of interactive seminars and workshops will also be held on the day focusing on such opportunities. The exhibiting iGaming companies at the event include Tain, Game Theory, Betfair, Unibet, Regent Markets and MyBet.\n\nThe event will be held at the Corinthia San Gorg Hotel on July 14th from 9am to 8pm. The general public is invited to attend.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The unit focuses on keeping badminton free from doping and match manipulation. On a day-to-day basis, the Integrity Unit manages the anti-doping and anti-match fixing programmes, as well as planning and implementing awareness, information, education, and deterrence initiatives within the badminton community.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Licensees are particularly reminded of their obligation to carry out sanctions screening prior to the onset of a business relationship and thereafter on a risk-sensitive basis. The issue of new or updated sanctions should be considered as a triggering event to run fresh checks on one’s customers. Furthermore, licensees are also reminded of their obligation to stop any transaction from going through, freeze any assets and inform the SMB of any customers matching with the applicable sanctions lists.\n\nMoreover, the Authority is stressing the importance that licensees ensure:\n\nThat any systems used to monitor sanctions are being run in an effective and efficient manner;\nThat they are informed with any updates regarding the Russia/Ukraine situation and, as a result, calibrate their sanctions monitoring systems in order to reflect any additions made to the applicable lists being monitored; and\nThat they react swiftly in ensuring that their customer databases are subject to the most recently updated and applicable sanctions lists.\n\nLicensees are reminded to continuously keep up-to-date with any sanctions that may be imposed and with any guidance, notices, decisions, recommendations, or rulings that may be issued by the SMB by visiting the SMB’s website (https://foreignandeu.gov.mt/en/Government/SMB/Pages/SMB-Home.aspx) and by subscribing to the SMB’s notification updates. To subscribe to the SMB notifications on the latest UN/EU/National sanctions, please send an email to [email protected].\n\nLicensees are also being reminded of any AML/CFT related obligations, particularly in terms of geographical risks posed to licensees by the geographical location of the business/economic activity and the source of wealth/funds of their customers. Within this context, licensees are reminded that international financial sanctions need to be considered within their customer risk assessments.\n\nFor more information in this respect, reference should be made to the Guidance Note published by the FIAU.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

It also bore testament to the MGA’s and FIAU’s commitment to communicate with key stakeholders and ensure an environment of dialogue, cooperation, and partnership.”\n\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys4xBeHRjdw[/embedyt]\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

This was a kind of evolution of financial services, given the fiscal incentives we had in the financial services regime, and gaming companies started to set up here to benefit from them. As Malta continued to attract increasing numbers of companies, the authorities recognised that an opportunity existed to provide a regulated environment for the growing industry. In 2004, Malta was the first EU member state to launch remote gaming regulations, establishing a new regulatory framework that offered operators a pan-European online gaming licence. Malta’s developed ICT infrastructure, coupled with our high standards of regulatory policy and education, our skills, English-speaking population, political stability, as well as EU membership, were all critical success factors.\n\nMalta has a reputation for being one of the most tried and tested jurisdictions in the world, and this reputation has served us well for all these years. Now, 11 years down the line, it’s clear that what brought us here will not take us there. We can’t use the same approach going forward as the landscape has changed drastically. To stay ahead of the game, we are in the process of overhauling the iGaming regulations. It is an intensely competitive market and the dynamics have changed with the concept of national authorisations – a move accepted by the European Commission. We are also taking a fresh look at how to future-proof the MGA for the next ten years and cater for new technology and games, as well as changing consumer needs. Key benefits of Malta are its beneficial fiscal regime, pro-business government and its complete ecosystem that supports the entire gaming industry. Additional services to the gaming industry are provided by professionals in other sectors, such as lawyers, accountants and ICT service providers.\n\nThe fact that Malta is English speaking across the board is a big asset as is our excellent education system that provides the necessary skills-set for the industry. Gaming has also created a big expat community in Malta, which is a sign of success – Malta is a safe place to live, with the added bonus of a great climate and relaxed Mediterranean lifestyle. We have a good business portfolio, with 270 companies and over 460 active licences. We are in the process of transforming the MGA into a regulatory organisation with an entrepreneurial spirit, instilling a more private-sector mindset with more agility, professionalism and efficiency. We are inspecting all areas within the authority – research, IT infrastructure, business intelligence, automation, intelligence tools – and creating a channel to consult and communicate with operators and players, publish consultation documents to get a reaction from the industry, and build our know-how to raise the quality of our decision-making. The MGA is also hiring fresh talent and investing more in training. Our aim is to have a stronger physical and online presence.\n\nQ: What new initiatives is the MGA working on?\n\nWe are working to create a complete gaming ecosystem and have recently rebranded the entire organisation. One of the major changes will be the overhaul of the regulatory framework. We have also launched GamingMalta, which is the promotional body for the gaming industry, and are working on the knowledge development aspect, by launching the Gaming Academy in 2015. These two initiatives will add significant value to the Malta licence. We are strengthening our position as Europe’s top gaming jurisdiction and placing strong focus on enhancing consumer protection.\n\nQ: How are you developing the regulation side of things at the MGA?\n\nOur vision is to be the top regulator in the world when it comes to remote gaming. We’ve had that pole position before, and we want it again. Over the years, we’ve lost some of that edge with other jurisdictions coming onto the scene and our model has been copied nicely. However, imitation is the best form of flattery. Today, our key priority is to ensure we have a regulatory framework in place that incentivises innovation in the industry, enables us to start licensing other forms of gaming, and raises the standards of our service providers. The MGA wants to bring in a better concept of certification for service providers to allow more products to be launched so that the market can grow and develop. We’re looking to strengthen our compliance and due diligence processes and increase the powers of the MGA, so that we’ll have more teeth when it comes to enforcement, as we must protect and foster a healthy industry. The Key Officials will assume more ownership of the responsibilities they are taking on and will not be allowed to resign in the case where there is a suspension of a licence and the MGA is taking enforcement action. We are adopting a risk based approach and also upgrading our call centre to be able to tackle any potential problems from the get-go, rather than allowing escalation.\n\nQ: What do you see as your current top priority?\n\nWe want to excel in consumer protection, as this can be Malta’s strong point and a force for leading the way globally. Malta must be known for something unique and special, not just because it’s sunny or because there are a lot of operators based here. The aim is to make the name Malta Gaming Authority synonymous with consumer protection.\n\nQ: How do you see the gaming industry developing and what markets are you targeting?\n\nI don’t want to see Malta develop only in terms of licences – the fact that the industry grew by 25% in 2014 is great – but the focus should be on quality rather than quantity. My vision is to grow our portfolio, keep opening up new markets and promote Malta as a top gaming jurisdiction. But we can also provide new services that are currently not provided in other jurisdictions – Malta can be a disaster recovery site, or a base for game development, research and development, as well as an area for back office operations. The big growth markets on the MGA agenda are South America and China, with whom we already have good relations. Digital games are popular in Asia and could be localised. Malta can be special in the sense that it could facilitate access to these markets. However, it won’t be easy because China is a closed market – gambling is illegal, but digital games of skill are legal. For example, poker is considered a game of skill in Asia. In Europe there are a number of challenges, with various member states imposing a requirement on operators to obtain their national licence, before they can provide gaming services in their country. Point of Consumption tax and the new VAT directive are creating obstacles for the potential growth of this sector. I would rather see Europe and regulators work together to tackle the unregulated market, where the player is not protected and not enough is being done.\n\nQ: Where would you like to see Malta positioned in the next five to ten years?\n\nI would like to see Malta recognised as being the true centre of excellence in the global gaming industry. We want operators and players to see Malta as the best location to be based for both our excellent regulatory framework and for the expertise we have created to support the growth of a vibrant industry.\n\nThis article can also be found on the Gaming Malta 2015 publication.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

This year’s conference brought together over 90 representatives from 26 member states.\n\nThe event served as a pivotal platform for gaming regulators from across Europe to engage in meaningful discussions, exchange knowledge, and collaborate on the latest trends and challenges in the gaming industry.\n\nRepresenting the MGA were three officials – Senior Legal Counsel, Martina Cilia; Chief Officer for Policy & International Affairs, Kinga Warda; and Chief Officer for Finance & Business Transformation, Peter Spiteri.\n\nMartina Cilia provided updates on the MGA’s Player Protection Directive and the inclusion of markers of harm during the panel discussion on player protection. Throughout the extensive process of developing the amendments of the Player Protection Directive, the MGA adopted an evidence-based approach that served as guidance through data and research literature, as well as a consultation conducted with licensees. In this manner, the MGA was better positioned to appraise the current legislative instrument and continue to prioritise the protection of players.\n\nPeter Spiteri – who is also the co-chair of the GREF’s InfoStat Working Group – provided an update on the group’s work and future ambitions. He stated: “The InfoStat working group serves as a crucial platform for regulators to discuss how to leverage data to improve gambling policies and decision-making processes. As the chair of the Infostat group, I am committed to harnessing the power of data to foster innovation and responsible gambling practices”.\n\nKinga Warda moderated a panel discussion entitled “Black Market activity: Combatting Illegal Activity”. Kinga, who is also a Board Member of GREF, said: “The exchange of ideas and insights during the conference reinforced the importance of collaboration in further strengthening a responsible and enjoyable environment whilst protecting the interest and well-being of individuals. The diverse perspectives of our fellow regulators are crucial in the process of shaping robust and inclusive policies. By embracing these varied viewpoints and collaborating effectively, we can collectively address the evolving landscape of the gaming industry and ensure its long-term sustainability”.\n\nEvents such as these serve as an excellent platform to foster networking and collaboration with our international stakeholders. The MGA looks forward to more fruitful conferences and events, both on a local and international level.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

The consultation serves as an opportunity for licensees to actively participate and further contribute towards the development of this code.\n\nIn 2022, the MGA embarked upon a journey – underpinned by the Authority’s objective of promoting a sustainable gaming sector that safeguards players’ rights – to explore the development of such a code, with the aim of guiding and preparing licensees for upcoming ESG legislation (particularly the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive), and of helping them reap the benefits of running a sustainably-conscious operation.\n\nThe ESG code seeks to serve as an instrument for self-regulation, helping remote gaming companies align with best practices and maintain a position that allows them to effectively meet the evolving expectations of key stakeholders in the sector.\n\nThe draft ESG code is the result of a six-month journey, consisting of three extensive stages: the peer review and research phase, materiality assessment, and stakeholder interviews. The pre-consultation activities established a solid foundation for subsequent consultations, ensuring that the code is well-informed and reflective of the industry’s ESG priorities and stakeholder expectations.\n\nThis is now ready for a final round of feedback from key stakeholders.\n\nWhile the proposed code applies to remote gaming companies, the Authority is exploring the possibility of extending it to the land-based sector in Malta, with a view to including such entities within scope in the future, and with ESG disclosures being adapted as required.\n\nKindly contact the Authority on [email protected] with any queries or feedback regarding the consultation.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

In this regard, the old B2B Report format shall no longer be accessible and any new submissions shall be made within the September 2023 report, which is due 20 October 2023.  \n\nThe revised B2B Report shall, amongst other things, require the B2B reporting entity to enter the names of its B2B/B2C client companies it provides its licensable services to, and specify the relationship type/s from a provided list, allowing for multiple relationship types to be selected.  In this regard, the licensable services the B2B reporting entity receives are not reportable within the B2B Report.\n\nAs opposed to the current report, the revised version introduces an improved functionality that permits licensees to deactivate specific records when, for example, a previous relationship has been terminated. Moreover, the new version also contains an ‘Instructions’ tab describing in detail the relationship types that need to be reported and also includes some practical examples.  \n\nLicensees are kindly requested to contact the MGA by sending an email to [email protected] for any clarification or additional guidance.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"

Whilst most individuals treat gambling as a recreational activity and spend only what they can afford to lose, others are unable to do so. It is therefore of the utmost importance that responsible gambling and player protection is high on the agenda of gaming operators.\n\nThe Authority’s overriding objectives are to promote responsible gaming and to safeguard players’ rights. The aim is to ensure that all players can gamble in a safe, secure and sustainable manner, mitigating the risk of gambling problems or gambling-related harm. This is a shared responsibility between the player, the operator and the Authority. To achieve this objective, licensed operators must always ensure that, players are never encouraged to:\n\nThe Player Protection Directive (Directive 2 of 2018) sets out various obligations which must be rigorously adhered to. As part of the Directive, operators must prominently display on all websites licensed by the Authority:\n\nThe licensee details\nA sign which indicates that underage gaming is not permissible.\nA ‘responsible gaming’ message, explaining that gaming can be harmful if it is not controlled, and information about the player support measures on the website.\nDynamic seal or kite mark\nA link leading to a webpage or application which includes all relevant responsible gaming information required by the Directive. This information must be clear and intelligible, and within one click from anywhere on the website\nA link which enables players to refer to one or more gambling help organisations.\nA message before first deposit, providing information and access to available responsible gaming tools and limits.\nPlayers should never be encouraged to:\n01\nEngage in prolonged, continuous gameplay\n02\nWager winnings\n03\nChase losses\n04\nSpend more than a player can afford\n05\nGamble whilst under the age of 18\n \nSafer Gambling Tools\n\nIn order to offer a safe gambling environment and experience, and to prevent or minimize gambling-related harm, licensed operators are required to offer the below safer gambling tools.\n\nSelf-Exclusion\n\nEffective self-exclusion programs have been shown to be linked with a reduction of pathological gambling and the effects of gambling-related harm. In view of this, licensed operators must always have an effective and readily available mechanism whereby players can exclude themselves from playing for a definite or indefinite timeframe.\n\nOperators are encouraged to offer a definite self-exclusion for the following timeframes:\n24 Hours\n48 Hours\n7 Days\n30 Days\n90 Days\n180 Days\n365 Days\nThe self-exclusion process must always be available and straightforward. Moreover, a request for a new self-exclusion, or extending a current exclusion must be implemented immediately, with no attempts to induce a player to continue playing.\nWhere multiple brands are operated, with separate registration, the operator must enquire whether the exclusion request is for all brands. However, the operator may apply a self-exclusion on the requested brand only.\nA self-exclusion request shall be applicable across all operated brands, if there are sufficient indications that the player may have problem gambling issues.\nDuring a self-exclusion, players must not access gaming services, however, players must not be prevented from withdrawing funds.\nRemoving a self-exclusion can only be implemented following the account holders request, whereby the player must:\nProvide an explanation why the self-exclusion was requested.\nProvide evidence that they are now able to manage their gambling safely and sustainably.\nWhen reopening an account, it is recommended that operators encourage players to utilise responsible gaming tools. The player may be granted access after at least a 24-hour cooling-off period for a definite exclusion, and 7 days for an indefinite exclusion.\n\nGaming Limits and Reality Checks\n\nIn-line with the Player Protection Directive (Directive 2 of 2018), operators must provide responsible gambling tools, to assist players in managing their gambling in a safe and sustainable manner. Whilst either Deposit or Wagering Limits are mandatory, operators are encouraged to offer further limits:\n\nDeposit Limits – Allows the player to limit the amount of money that can be deposited within a set timeframe; usually daily, weekly or monthly.\nWagering Limits – Limit the amount of money that can be wagered within a timeframe. When calculating the amount wagered, bonuses and other player incentives need not be considered.\nLoss Limits – Allows a player to limit the amount of money that can be lost within a given timeframe; usually daily, weekly or monthly.\nTime Limits or Session Limits – These allow a player to limit the amount of time which they spend playing.\nDuring the player registration process, or before the first deposit, operators must provide players with the opportunity to set either deposit limits or wagering limits and ensure that the ability to set limits always remains available and easily accessible.\nWhere limits are imposed on a player, consideration must be taken that any limits set are realistic to the players income and wealth.\nAny limit implemented can only be removed upon the player’s request or upon the expiry of the set timeframe. Should a player request more stringent limits, this must be effective immediately. Should a player request less stringent limits, this shall only be effective after at least 24 hours from the day on which the operator receives the request.\nWhere a player applies multiple limits, the strictest limit must take precedence. For example, a player sets a €20 per day and a €40 per week wager limits. On day 1, the player wagers €20, and is prevented from wagering any further (the strictest limit is applied). On day 2, €18 is wagered. On day 3, despite the customer having a €20 per day wager limit, the player can only wager €2, as combined throughout the week, the player would have wagered €40, and so this becomes the stricter limit which must be imposed. The player is now prevented from wagering for the remainder of the week.\nOperators must offer players the ability to set a pop-up alert at certain time intervals. The alert shall suspend play and remind players to stay in control of their gambling. The alert must also provide statistics of the amount of time the player has spent playing, the amounts wagered, and any winnings/losses during the gaming session. The player must confirm that the message has been read and be given the option to end the session.\n \nResponsible Gaming Policies\n\nOperators must have effective and regularly updated policies and procedures to promote responsible gambling. These shall factor in the products offered, and any emanating risks. Such policies shall include a variety of measures to detect and identify problem gambling, and any actions or behaviour that indicates that a player is at risk of developing gambling problems.\n\nWhen concerning behaviour is identified, the operator is obligated to take effective steps to address this, and to prevent exacerbation of existing or developing problems. Operators must retain evidence that the relevant policies and procedures were followed, and a record of any investigations conducted, the decisions taken, and any responsible gaming player interactions conducted.\n\nThe minimum criteria which operators must consider when ascertaining the existence of gambling-related harm include:\n\nThe amount and frequency of deposits and, or wagers\nThe use of multiple payment methods\nThe reversal of pending withdrawals\nCommunication-based indicators such as increased player complaints and bonus requests\nUse of responsible gaming tools\n\nThe above are the minimum required factors to consider when determining the existence of gambling problems, however licensees are encouraged to employ mechanisms which take into consideration other factors, such as:\n\nThe number of declined or failed deposits\nLate-night play and any increase in late-night play\nThe players age\nAverage daily stake\nReinvesting ‘big wins’\nProximity of deposit attempts to payday\nIncrease in the number/variety of games played\nNumber of deposits during gaming sessions\nCustomer only utilises ‘no-deposit bonuses’ for gameplay\n\nOperators must ensure that employees who deal with responsible gaming-related matters, or general player interactions, are routinely and appropriately trained in responsible gaming procedures. Employees must be qualified to look out for any players demonstrating signs or indications of gambling-related harm.\n\nOperators must implement effective policies which prevent minors from making use of their gaming service in any way. These shall include requiring players to affirm that they are of legal age before using the gaming service. Where a minor bypasses these policies and procedures, the operator, upon becoming aware that a player is underage, shall take all necessary steps to block the minor, and to return them to the same position they were in prior to playing, returning any monies wagered and confiscating all winnings.\n\nWith regards to demo games, the operator must ensure that the Return to Player (RTP) percentage for demo games is the same as set on real money games.\n\nComplaints and Disputes\n\nLicensed operators must have a Player Support team, with sufficient resources to effectively interact with players and are required to have a clearly documented procedure for fairly managing complaints and disputes, whilst establishing the expected timeframe to settle a dispute or refer the matter to the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) entity. The procedure shall be readily available to the players and included within the terms and conditions.\n\nWhen a player has exhausted the internal dispute resolution process, operators must offer the opportunity to refer any dispute to a registered ADR entity. Operators must ensure that their complaints procedure includes the details of the ADR entity to whom disputes can be referred to.\n\nThe conclusions of the ADR entity shall be binding upon both parties. Referring a dispute to an ADR entity does not restrict the player’s right to bring proceedings against the operator in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nEngaging an Alternative Dispute Resolution Entity\n\nPrior to ‘going live’, an operator must engage an ADR entity, established within the European Union or the European Economic Area, and competent to adjudicate on gaming disputes. All approved ADR entities can be found here.\n\nWhen a contractual agreement has been reached with an ADR entity, the operator must notify the Authority by uploading a soft copy of the contract via the application entitled ‘Operational-ADR Declaration’, located in the Licensee Portal. The agreement must include the effective date, duration, fees, termination conditions and parties’ signatures. Operators must also inform the Authority upon terminating any agreement with an ADR entity.\n\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\nWho We Are Our Values Our Structure Careers Organisation Chart\nOur Work Annual Reports & Audited Financial Statements Regulatory Framework Partnerships Publications Consultations Guidance Notes News\nPlayer Hub Licensee Register Lodge a Complaint Safer Gambling Self-Barring Unauthorised URLs\nLicensee Hub Applications Compliance Enforcement Register Licensee Register Recognition Notice Register\nLicensee Portal FAQs Contact Us Privacy Policy\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\n Malta Gaming Authority\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nLicensee Portal\n \nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU\nUseful Links\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nContact Us\nFAQs\nWho We Are\nOur Work\nPlayer Hub\nLicensee Hub\nFacebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn\nCopyright © 2024\nMalta Gaming Authority\nAll Rights Reserved.\nDesigned By Redorange\nDeveloped By NIU"
