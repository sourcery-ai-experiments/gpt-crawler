Split tests can be created for any of the opt-in forms that you have built with Bloom. So what is a Split Test? Split testing is a way to compare the performance of multiple variations of the same opt-in form to help you figure out which one is the most effective. Using the Bloom Split Testing system, you can create different variations of an opt-in to test different headlines, colors, and offers. These different variations will be shown to different visitors, and their conversion rate will be compared to each other. Over time you can see which one is resulting in the most sign-ups, and you can pick the highest performing variation to be your main version.\n\nCreating Your First Split Test\n\nAfter you have created an opt-in, you can begin running split tests. Navigate to the Bloom > Email Optins tab in the WordPress Dashboard to display a list of your current opt-ins. You will notice that each of your active opt-ins have several icons to the right of the opt-in name. The first one is the “split testing” icon. Click this icon to initiate a split test.\n\nClick the split testing icon shown above to initiate a split test.\n\nCreate New Variations\n\nYou can create as many variations as you like for your split test. Each of these variations will be split up equally between all of your visitors. To add your first variant, click the “Add Variant” button.\n\nThis will bring you to through the standard opt-in creation process. You will notice that the “Display” tab has been removed, since you are only modifying the appearance of the opt-in (not where the opt-in appears). Design your new opt-in with the changes you want to test (such as creating a new headline, or adjusting the colors of the button). Once you click “Save & Exit,” your new variation will be added to your opt-in list.\n\nBeginning Your Split Test\n\nAs you create new variants for a given opt-in, you will notice that these variations appear below the main opt-in in your list of active opt-ins in the Bloom settings panel. Once you have created all of the variations that you want to test, it’s time to begin the test. Press the “start test” button to activate the split test. Once the test has been started, you can also pause the test at any time by clicking the “pause test” button.\n\nObserving The Results & Ending Your Test\n\nAs your test runs, you can observe the conversion rate of each opt-in. The conversion rate is displayed right in the list of opt-ins, as well as in the Bloom stats page. Once you are satisfied with the results, it’s time to end the test and pick your favorite (the highest performing variation). To end the test, click the “End Test And Pick Winner” button.\n\nThis button will initiate a pop-up window with a list of all your variations, ranked by performance. Simply click on the one you would like to use to end the test and select this variant to use as the main version of your opt-in. This will delete the rest of your unused variations."

Whenever you create a Locked Content or Inline opt-in, you can use the shortcode to place this newly-created form anywhere on your website. You can access these shortcodes from within the Bloom settings panel, or from within the Bloom Shortcodes button in the WordPress post editor.\n\nWhat Is A Shortcode?\n\nA shortcode is a piece of code that has been simplified for convenience, and can be used to create an advanced element (in this case, a Bloom opt-in). A shortcode will look something like this: [et_bloom_inline optin_id=”optin_4″] Copying and pasting this code into the WordPress post editor will display the associated opt-in on the post or page you are editing.\n\nGenerating A Shortcode During Opt-In Creation\n\nShortcodes are only created for Locked Content and Inline opt-in forms. After you create either of these opt-in types, you will notice a “Generate Shortcode” button on the final tab of the settings page. Pressing this button will display the shortcode that you can copy and paste into your post or page.\n\nGeneration A Shortcode From The Opt-In List\n\nYou can also generate a shortcode for an Inline or Locked Content form from within the Bloom Settings page by clicking the shortcode icon for the desired opt-in in your opt-in list.\n\nGenerating A Shortcode From Within The Post Editor\n\nAll of your active opt-ins with associated shortcodes are also easily accessible right from the WordPress Post Editor. At any time while writing your post, you can use the Bloom button within the post editor to add a shortcode to your post. Simply click the button to get a list of available opt-ins and select the one that you would like to add.\n\nUsing The Locked Content Shortcode\n\nThe locked content shortcode is unique in that it must be “wrapped around” the content that you would like to lock. When you generate the shortcode you will notice that it has two parts: [et_bloom_locked optin_id=”optin_5″] and [/et_bloom_locked]. Whatever content is placed in between these two parts will be locked and only revealed with the visitor subscribes to your list."

Namely, they control when they are triggered based on various user interactions. These triggers can be used by themselves, or in combination with other triggers, to yield different results. These triggers can thus be tailored to your specific content, or your specific social sharing goals. Certain triggers are more general and heavy handed, while other triggers are more subtle and target a specific subset of users. Be sure to watch the video for a detailed explanation of how these triggers can be used.\n\nTrigger Settings\nTrigger After Time Delay\n\nIf Automatic PopUps are enabled, this setting will appear, allowing you to specify the timed delay (in seconds) of your social po-pup.\n\nTrigger After Inactivity\n\nThis will cause the pop-up to appear once the user has been inactive for a certain period of time. If the user has left their computer, or left the tab after reading your post, try reminding them to subscribe when they get back!\n\nTrigger at Bottom of Post\n\nJust as a reader reaches the end of your page or post content is a perfect time to offer them a way to subscribe to your content. Enabling this pop-up trigger will auto detect the end of your content and do just that.\n\nTrigger After Scrolling\n\nThis will trigger the pop-up after the visitor has scrolled a certain percentage down the page. Depending on the size of your page, and the content within it, you can have the pop-up trigger at specific points within the reading. Depending on the situation, having the pop-up or fly-in trigger at certain percentages may be much more effective than a timing delay.\n\nTrigger After Commenting\n\nThis is a great way to target your most engaged visitors. When this is enabled, your visitor will be greeted with a pop-up or fly-in after they have posted a comment on your website.\n\nTrigger After Purchasing\n\nThis is another great way to target your most engaged visitors. When this is enabled, your customers will be asked to subscribe to your website after they have successfully purchased a product using WooCommerce.\n\nTriggers NOTE\n\nNo matter how many triggers you have selected above, Bloom will only use whichever trigger occurs first so that your users are not overwhelmed with pop-ups if you have multiple triggers enabled."

If you are building a Pop-Up of Fly-In, you can also adjust a set of “trigger” that affect when your opt-in is displayed. For example, you could create a Pop-Up that exists on all pages, but is only triggered when a visitor reaches the bottom of your post. Or you could create a fly-in to exists only on a certain category of posts, and is only displayed after a visitor comments.\n\nBy targeting specific opt-ins to specific parts of your site, you can optimize them to be more relevant to your visitors. For example, you would might not want to offer a special discount to someone who is ready your blog post about “web design,” but you might want to offer them a free ebook where they can learn even more.

For more information about how each opt-in type works, and how to configure them, please continue reading.\n\nTo create your first opt-in form, click on the Bloom > Email Optins link in your WordPress Dashboard. Here you will see a list of your current optins, as well as a button to create a new opt-in.\n\nClick the “New Optin” button to reveal the 6 opt-in types mentioned above. Pick the opt-in in type that you would like to create to continue on to the opt-in configuration.\n\nCreating An Opt-In Form\n\nTo create an opt-in form, click on the\n\nBloom > Email Optins\n\nlink with the WordPress Dashboard, or click the “Home” icon within the Bloom settings page to open up the main settings tab. Here you can manage the opt-ins that you have created in the past, as well as create new opt-ins. To create your first opt-in form, click the “New Optin” button. This will reveal the 6 opt-in types that Bloom supports.\n\nPop-Up\n\nThe pop-up opt-in displays a ligthtbox pop-up on your website. Within the pop-up is a form that visitors can use to subscribe to your mailing list. Pop-ups are highly effective at collecting emails due to the simple fact that they cannot be ignored. These pop-ups can be placed anywhere on your website, and they can also be triggered based on unique user interactions. When combining pop-ups with triggers, you can make your opt-in form even more effective by asking visitors to subscribe at the optimum moment (such as when they have finished reading a post, after they have posted a comment, or after they have purchased a product).\n\nBuilding your opt-in is broken into three steps. During these three steps you can 1) Assign an email account to your opt-in, 2) customize the design of your opt-in, and 3) adjust the location of the opt-in on your website.\n\nSetup\n\nWithin the Setup tab of the opt-in creation process, you can give your opt-in a name (for future reference) and assign an email account to the opt-in form. Before you can start collecting email addresses, you first need to connect Bloom to your email marketing service, such as MailChimp or Constant Contact. If you have not already added an account to Bloom, you can do so here. If you have already added an account to Bloom, then you can select the account and the associate email list from within the Form Integration settings on this page. For detailed information about how to add accounts to bloom, as well as a comprehensive list of all account types support by Bloom, please refer to our in-depth accounts tutorial.\n\nDesign\n\nWithin the Design tab, you can customize the appearance of your opt-in form. Bloom comes with tons of design settings, such as background color, font color, button color, form color, image and form location, border styles and much more. Within this tab you can adjust all of these settings, as well as preview your form by clicking the Preview button. For an comprehensive look at the Bloom design settings, please refer to our in-depth design tutorial.\n\nDisplay\n\nThe Display tab is where you adjust how, where and when your opt-in form appears on your website. You can choose to display your form on specific posts, pages or categories, or exclude specific posts or pages. You can also adjust the triggers that control when your pop-up and fly-in opt-ins appear. These opt-ins can be triggered based on different user interactions. For a detailed look at triggers and how to use them effectively, please refer to our in-depth triggers tutorial. For a comprehensive look at all of Bloom’s display settings, please refer to our in-depth locations tutorial.\n\nFly_in\n\nThe fly-in is very similar to the pop-up opt-in, except it is a bit more subtle, Instead of taking up the entire screen, the fly-in presents a smaller opt-in box that slides up from the bottom corner of the screen. Fly-ins can be highly effective without getting too aggressive. These fly-ins can be placed anywhere on your website, and they can also be triggered based on unique user interactions. When combining fly-ins with triggers, you can make your opt-in form even more effective by asking visitors to subscribe at the optimum moment (such as when they have finished reading a post, after they have posted a comment, or after they have purchased a product).\n\nBuilding your opt-in is broken into three steps. During these three steps you can 1) Assign an email account to your opt-in, 2) customize the design of your opt-in, and 3) adjust the location of the opt-in on your website.\n\nSetup\n\nWithin the Setup tab of the opt-in creation process, you can give your opt-in a name (for future reference) and assign an email account to the opt-in form.

For a comprehensive look at all of Bloom’s display settings, please refer to our in-depth locations tutorial.\n\nBelow Post\n\nThis is perhaps the most simple and classic opt-in form. When this form is enabled, it places an opt-in box at the bottom of your posts and pages. If a visitor has enjoyed your post and read the entire thing, they will be greeted with a chance to subscribe when they are finished. This is a great way to capture your more attentive readers. These opt-ins can be placed site-wide, or they can be targeted to specific posts or post types.\n\nBuilding your opt-in is broken into three steps. During these three steps you can 1) Assign an email account to your opt-in, 2) customize the design of your opt-in, and 3) adjust the location of the opt-in on your website.\n\nSetup\n\nWithin the Setup tab of the opt-in creation process, you can give your opt-in a name (for future reference) and assign an email account to the opt-in form.

You can choose to display your form on specific posts, pages or categories, or exclude specific posts or pages. For a comprehensive look at all of Bloom’s display settings, please refer to our in-depth locations tutorial.\n\nInline\n\nThe inline opt-in allows you to place an opt-in form anywhere on your website manually using a shortcode. Unlike some of the other opt-in types, which are automatically displayed in certain locations, the inline opt-in form generates a shortcode that you can copy and paste inside the WordPress post editor, allowing to place the form anywhere inside of a post or page.\n\nSetup\n\nWithin the Setup tab of the opt-in creation process, you can give your opt-in a name (for future reference) and assign an email account to the opt-in form. Before you can start collecting email addresses, you first need to connect Bloom to your email marketing service, such as MailChimp or Constant Contact.

For an comprehensive look at the Bloom design settings, please refer to our in-depth design tutorial.\n\nGenerate Shortcode\n\nAfter you have configured your locked content opt-in, you will be presented with a “generate shortcode” button. This button will display the shortcode that you can use to place your locked content opt-in form anywhere on your website. You can also access a list of all of your shortcodes from within the Bloom Shortcode button within the WordPress post editor, or by clicking the shortcode icon within the opt-in management tab in your Bloom settings panel.\n\nLocked Content\n\nLocked content is a great way to get new subscribers by requiring them to subscribe to your list before they get access to a free resource. After you finish creating your locked content opt-in, you will be give a shortcode that you can use to wrap the content that you would like to lock within any given post or page. For example, you could lock a link that gives down-loadable access to your eBook. Or you could write a great post, and lock the second half of the post for only your subscribers to access.\n\nBuilding your opt-in is broken into three steps. During these three steps you can 1) Assign an email account to your opt-in, 2) customize the design of your opt-in, and 3) copy and paste the shortcode into your post or page.\n\nSetup\n\nWithin the Setup tab of the opt-in creation process, you can give your opt-in a name (for future reference) and assign an email account to the opt-in form.

You can also access a list of all of your shortcodes from within the Bloom Shortcode button within the WordPress post editor, or by clicking the shortcode icon within the opt-in management tab in your Bloom settings panel.\n\nWidget\n\nWhen you create a widget opt-in, Bloom will turn your newly created opt-in form into a widget that can be placed inside any widget-ready area on your website, such as your footer or sidebar. Simply place the “Bloom” widget into your widget area and select the opt-in widget that you would like to display from the dropdown menu.\n\nBuilding your opt-in is broken into three steps.

After you have created a form and chosen a base template, you will be taken to the Design tab where you can continue to modify various aspects of your design, as outlined below.\n\nTitle and Message\n\nHere you can adjust the text content that appears within your opt-in.\n\nOptin Title\n\nThis is the header that will appear at the top of your form in large text.\n\nOptin Message\n\nThis text will appear below your header, and will use a smaller font size.\n\nThe title and message fields can be used to describe your newsletter or special offer. They can also be left blank if you don’t want to include any text in your opt-in. Both the title and message can be modified using the post editor, giving you the ability to adjust font color, weight and orientation.\n\nImage Settings\n\nHere you can add an image to your opt-in, as well as adjust where that image appears within the opt-in box.\n\nImage Orientation\n\nThis setting affects where the image appears within your opt-in form. You can choose to have the image appear above or below, or to the left or right of your title and message.\n\nImage URL\n\nThis is the URL to the image that you would like to use within your opt-in box. You can input a custom URL to a static online resource, or you can click the “Upload Image” button to upload your own image to use in the form.\n\nImage Load-In Animation\n\nImages can be assigned a load-in animation. When the image is first loaded, this animation will occur. It can be a nice subtle touch that catches your visitor’s eye and encourages them to read your message and subscribe to your list.\n\nHide Image On Mobile\n\nIf you are worried about the size of your opt-in form on mobile, you can choose to disable the image when browsing your website on mobile devices. This will hide the image on mobile and give more room for your title, message and input fields.\n\nHere is an example of two opt-in forms, both of which have images enabled. One has the image placed on the left, while the second has the image placed below the text.\n\nOpt-in Styling\n\nThese design settings affect the entire opt-in form, and constitute a set of general styles for your form.\n\nBackground Color\n\nThe will change the background color of your opt-in.\n\nHeader Font\n\nHere you can change the font that is used for your opt-in title.\n\nBody Font\n\nHere you can adjust the font that is used for your opt-in message.\n\nText Color\n\nThis will change the color of both your opt-in header and body. You can choose between “light” and “dark,” depending on the background color you have chosen. If you have chosen a dark background color, then make sure your text is set to “light” so that it will be visible. If you background is a light color, make sure you text color is set to dark.\n\nCorner Style\n\nHere you can choose a corner style for your op-tin. Selecting rounded corners will apply rounded corners to the outer edges of the opt-in box.\n\nBorder Orientation\n\nHere you can add a border to your opt-in. This border can be applied to all 4 edges, or single edges.\n\nBorder Color\n\nIf you have opted to have a border on your opt-in, then this border color options will appear. Here you can select a color to be used for your opt-in border.\n\nHere is an example of two opt-ins that have had their styling adjusting. The one on the left has had its background color changed to dark blue with a light text color, while the one on right has a white background color with dark text. The opt-in form on the left has no border, while the one on the right has a full border.\n\nBorder Style\n\nIf you have opted to have a border, then you can adjust the border style here. In addition to the color setting in the previous section, you can also adjust the shape of the border.\n\nSolid\n\nThis is the most basic border style, and it creates a solid thin border around the edge of your opt-in.\n\nDashed\n\nThe dashed border creates an inset dashed line around the outer edge of your opt-in.\n\nDouble Stroke\n\nThe double stroke is similar to the Solid border, except it adds an additional solid inlay, creating the double bordered appearance.\n\nInlay\n\nThe inlay border creates a solid line border, however unlike the “solid” border, this inlay border is placed inside of the opt-in instead of on the outside edge.\n\nLetter\n\nThis creates a more playful border, imitating a classic snail-mail letter.\n\nForm Setup\n\nThese styles apply to the form and the input fields within the form. You can adjust their colors, as well as where the form appears within the opt-in box.\n\nForm Orientation\n\nThis adjusts where the form fields appear within your opt-in box. You can choose to have the form appear above, below or to the left or right of your opt-in title and message.\n\nEmail Text\n\nThis adjusts the placeholder words used within the email input form.\n\nButton Text\n\nHere you can adjust the text that appears within the submission button.\n\nButton Text Color\n\nHere you can adjust the color of the text used within the submission button.\n\nHere is an example of two different forms that have had their form setup settings adjusted. The form on the left has their form position set to bottom, while the one on the right has its form set to left.\n\nForm Styling\n\nThese settings apply to the actual form inside of the opt-in box.\n\nForm Field Orientation\n\nThis adjusts how the input fields appear within the form itself. You can choose to have your input fields displayed “inline” in a single row, or you can choose to have the fields stacked up on top of each other.\n\nForm Field Corner Style\n\nHere you can adjust the corner style of the fields, choosing between rounded or squared.\n\nForm Text Color\n\nHere you can adjust the color of the text that appears within the form input fields. If you are using a light background color, try use dark form field text so that it is readable.\n\nForm Background Color\n\nThis setting allow you to change to background color of the form. This, in combination with your opt-in background color, constitute the two main colors in your opt-in box.\n\nForm Button Color\n\nYou can adjust the color of your submission button here.\n\nHere is an example of two different forms that have had their settings adjusted. One has stacked forms, while the other has inline forms. Both have had the opt-in form background color adjusted, and the orange form has had its button color changed to white.\n\nForm Edge Style\n\nIn each opt-in box, there is an edge that separates the form from the text content. Here you can apply different styles to that edge, giving your opt-in box a unique feel.\n\nFooter Text, Success Message and Custom CSS\n\nThese settings give you extra control over the messages that appear during form submission, as well as give you the ability to add custom CSS tweaks to individual forms.\n\nForm Footer Text\n\nThis message will appear below the form input fields. A common use might be to link to a privacy policy, or ensure your users that you will not spam or share their information.\n\nSuccess Message\n\nThis is the message that appears after a visitor has successfully subscribed to your email list.\n\nCustom CSS\n\nHere you can add custom CSS that will apply only to the form you are building."

Next we will go over each of the different account types and their verification steps in detail:\n\nActiveCampaign\n\nWhen you select ActiveCampaign from the email provider dropdown menu, you will notice that some new fields appear:\n\nAccount Name\n\nThis can be anything you like, and is merely a reference for you to remember the account by.\n\nForm ID\n\nForm ID’s are optional, but they can used to pull settings from a form created within your AcitveCampaign account in order to enable double opt-in confirmation.\n\nAPI Key\n\nThe API Key is a special code that is given to you by ActiveCampaign that you can use to authenticate your account. This code can be found within your ActiveCampaign.com account dashboard.\n\nAPI URL\n\nThe API URL is a special URL that is assigned to your account by ActiveCampaign. This code can be found just below the API Key in your ActiveCampaign account dashboard.\n\nActiveCampaign requires an API Key and API URL in order to integrate with Bloom. You can find both the key and url in the API tab of your account settings page. To access your account settings, click on your profile image located on the far-right side of the main navigation toolbar and then click My Settings.\n\nCopy and paste the API Key and API URL into the appropriate fields on the Bloom account creation page. Next click “Authorize.” If your information is correct, your account will be verified and your email lists will appear below the API Settings.\nClick “Save & Exit” to finalize the process and add the account to Bloom. Once added, the account and its associated lists will appear in the E-mail Accounts tab of your Bloom settings panel. You can manage or delete this account at any time from within that tab.\n\nYou also have the option to use the optional “Form ID” field while authorizing your account. This should be used if you need to enable double opt-in confirmation. To create a new form within your ActiveCampaign account, log in and click on the “Apps” link. Next click the “Add Form” link to create a new form.\n\nThere is no need to adjust the form settings, since Bloom only supports the Name and Email fields. Instead, we need to locate the Form ID so that it can be added to your Bloom integration settings. ActiveCampaign doesn’t list this ID unfortunately, but luckily you can find it my looking at the URL in the browser’s address bar. While on the form creation page, look at your URL. It might look something like this: https://elegantthemes.activehosted.com/admin/main.php?action=form_edit&id=31. You should see a number attached to the end of the URL. That’s your form ID! Copy and paste that number into the “Form ID” field in Bloom and click “Authorize.” Now that you have connected Bloom to a specific form, it will use the standard ActiveCampaign work flow, including double opt-in confirmation.\n\nAweber\n\nWhen you select Aweber from the email provider dropdown menu, you will notice that a new tab is opened and some new fields appear:\n\nAccount Name\n\nThis can be anything you like, and is merely a reference for you to remember the account by.\n\nAuthorization Code\n\nThis is the code that Aweber gives you to authenticate your account with Bloom. You can generate this code in the new tab that was opened upon selecting Aweber. If no new tab was opened, be sure to disable any popup blockers you are using and then try refreshing the page.\n\n \n\nInside the new tab that was opened when you selected Aweber, you will be prompted to log in to your Aweber account. Input your username and password and click the “Allow Access” button. This will generate your authorization code.

    "html": "Bloom Plugin Documentation\nENTER SEARCH TERM\nDIVI\nEXTRA\nBLOOM\nMONARCH\nDIVI BUILDER\nDEVELOPERS\nBACK TO BLOOM PLUGIN DOCUMENTATION\nA Basic Overview Of The Bloom Plugin\n\nLearn the basics of the plugin in this complete video overview. Newcomers, start here!\n\nGetting Started\n\nBloom is an email opt-in plugin that was built to help you grow your email list. Bloom works by adding email opt-in forms to your website, each of which can connect to your email marketing or email newsletter software. When someone signs up using the Bloom opt-in form, they get added to your email list. Bloom works with tons of different email marketing software, and allowing you to create different types of opt-in forms that appear on different areas of your website and in different forms (such as pop-ups, fly-ins, or normal inline forms).\n\nAdd New Accounts\n\nBefore you can create a functioning opt-in form on your website using Bloom, you first need to connect Bloom to your email marketing software. Bloom works with several different systems, such as MailChimp, Constant Contact, MadMinim, iContact, InfusioSoft, Feedblitz, Aweber, Campaign Monitor, GetResponse, SendInBlue, MailPoet and Ontraport.\n\nThe first thing you want to do when using Bloom is connect one of these accounts. Click on the Tools > Bloom Settings link in your WordPress Dashboard to access the Bloom settings, and then click the accounts icon to open up the accounts tab. To add a new account, click the “Add Account” button. Here you can choose between the various different account types that Bloom supports. After an account is selected, you will be prompted to verify the account so that Bloom can connect with the system’s API. Each account may have a different method for verification, but in most cases you will be prompted to add your unique API key or AppID, which can be located within your email marketing software’s online account. For a complete step by step instructions on how to set up each different account type, please refer to our accounts tutorial. Our accounts tutorial explains exactly how to connect Bloom to each of the different systems that it supports.\n\nOnce you have added an account, it’s time to create your first op-tin form.\n\nCreating An Opt-In Form\n\nTo create an opt-in form, click on the Bloom > Email Optins link in your WordPress Dashboard, or click on the “Home” icon within the Bloom settings page to open up the main settings tab. Here you can manage the opt-ins that you have created in the past, as well as create new opt-ins. To create your first opt-in form, click the “New Optin” button. This will reveal the 6 opt-in types that Bloom supports.\n\n\nBloom allows you to create 6 different kinds of opt-in forms. There is not limit to how many forms you can create, and these forms can be displayed on unique areas of your website.\n\nPop-Up\n\nThe pop-up opt-in creates a lightbox pop-up on your page that contains your opt-in form. These pop-ups can be triggered using different Bloom triggers, giving you additional control over when users are presented with the pop-up. For more information about the pop-up optin, be sure to read our in-depth pop-up tutorial.\n\nFly-In\n\nThe fly-in is similar to the pop-up, but is a bit smaller and more subtle. Instead of creating a full-screen lightbox pop-up, the fly-in creates a smaller form that slides up from the bottom corner of the page. Just like the pop-up, these fly-ins can be triggered based on different user interactions using the Bloom triggers. For more information about how to use triggers effectively, but sure to check out our triggers tutorial. For a complete in-depth look at the fly-in optin, be sure to read our fly-in tutorial.\n\nBelow Post\n\nThis is perhaps the most common opt-in type. This creates an opt-in form that is automatically added to the bottom of your posts or pages. When a visitor finishes reading your post, they are presented with an opt-in form that allows them to subscribe to your blog updates. For more information about the below post opt-in, be sure to read our in-depth below post tutorial.\n\nInline\n\nThe inline opt-in allows you to add an opt-in form anywhere inside your posts and pages. The opt-in form automatically generates a shortcode that can be pasted inside your posts and pages to display the form anywhere on your website. For more information about using this opt-in, be sure to check out our in-depth inline tutorial.\n\nLocked Content\n\nLocked content is a great way to build your email list by requiring visitors to sign up before they get access to content on your website. You can lock content within a post, such as a link to download free resources. Once the visitor subscribes, they are granted access to the content hidden behind the form. Locked content opt-ins automatically generated a shortcode that you can place within your posts, wrapped around the content that you would like “lock.” Fore more information about this opt-in type, be sure to check out our in-depth locked content tutorial\n\nWidget\n\nThe widget opt-in automatically generates an opt-in in the form of a widget. Once generated, the widget will appear in your Widgets tab in the WordPress Dashboard, allowing you to add the form to any widgetzed area on your website (such as your website’s sidebar or footer). For more information about this opt-in type, be sure to read our in-depth widget tutorial.\n\nOnce you select your opt-in type, you will be taken to the opt-in creation screen where you can adjust the various opt-in settings. These settings are broken into three categories: Setup, Design and Display Settings/\n\nOpt-In Setup\n\nThe first page of the opt-in creation form is the Setup tab. Here you can adjust the name of your opt-in form, which is simply a way for you to remember the form by. It will be reference on the homepage tab and in your stats. You can also add a new opt-in account on this page if you have not already done so via the Accounts tab. If you have already created an account, then you can select that account here. Once you have selected an account, you will be given a lists associated email lists for that account. Select the list from the dropdown menu that you would like to use, and then proceed to the next page. Once your opt-in form goes live, subscribers will be added to the list/account that you selected here.\n\nOpt-In Design\n\nThe next step is to design your opt-in form. Once you proceed to the design tab, you will first be presented with a list of pre-made templates. Think of these as starting points. We have put a lot of work into creating over 100 design variations that we think look great. Browse through the thumbnails and select a variation that looks good to you. Don’t worry, you will still get to customize everything on the next page. Once you have selected a template starting point, click the next button to bring up the design customization settings.\n\nThese settings allow you to adjust every aspect of your opt-in form’s appearance. You can do simple things like change the title and description and image, or more advanced things like adjust the form’s background color, text color, orientation, image, border style, edge style and more. Using these different design settings in combination, you can build just about anything. You can also preview your customized form at any time by clicking the “Preview” button on the right hand side of the page. For more information about each design setting, as well as how to use these design settings effectively, be sure to read our in-depth design settings tutorial. Once you have finished designing your opt-in, click the “Next” button to proceed to the display settings.\n\nOpt-In Display\n\nThe opt-in display settings control how, where, and when your opt-in forms appear. You can choose to display your opt-in form on specific post types or categories. You can also target individual posts and pages, or exclude individual posts and pages. (Note: These settings do not exist for the Inline or Locked Content opt-in forms. These forms are displayed using shortcodes, and therefore these settings do not apply. If you are created an Inline or Locked Content form, you will be presented with a “Generate Shortcode” button. Simply copy and paste that shortcode into any post or page to display the opt-in form.)\n\nFor example, if you would like your opt-in form to to be displayed an all of your posts, but not any of your pages, you would select “Display On: Posts,” leaving the rest of the sections unchecked. If you would like your opt-in form to only appear on a single page, leave all areas under “Display On” unchecked, and then use the “Display On These Pages” section to target a specific page. If you would like you opt-in form to be displayed on your entire website, except for a single post or page, then you can select Display On: Everything,” and then exclude a single page using the “Do Not Display On These Posts” setting. Using these different settings, you can choose exactly where your opt-in form is displayed.\n\nIf you are creating a fly-in or pop-up opt-in, you will also be presented with various triggers. These triggers control not where your opt-in is displayed, but rather how and when your opt-in is displayed. For example, you can choose to trigger your opt-in form only after a visitor has finished reading your post, or only after a visitor has purchased one of your products. For more information about triggers, be sure to check out our in-depth triggers tutorial. For a complete look at all of the opt-in display settings, but sure to read our in-depth display settings tutorial.\n\nAfter you have finished creating your opt-in, click the “Save and Exit” button. This will bring you back to the home page of the Bloom settings panel. You will see your newly-created opt-in has been added to the page. You can modify, delete, de-activate or create split tests for this opt-in using the various settings icons.\n\nManaging Your Opt-Ins\n\nOnce you have created opt-in forms, you will notice that each form appears on the home page of the Bloom settings panel. Each of these opt-ins can be easily managed from this page. You can do various things with each opt-in using the setting icons that appear to the right of the opt-in name.\n\nGenerate Shortcode\n\nThe shortcode icons will appear for all locked content and inline opt-ins. Clicking this icon will display the shortcode needed for that specific form. Copy and past the shortcode into and post or page to display the opt-in.\nSplit Test – Split testing is a great way to optimize your opt-is. Initiating a split test allows you to create multiple variations of the same opt-in form, and then test those variations against each other to figure out which one has the highest conversion rate. Each variation that you create will be displayed to different visitors, and their stats will be kept separate. You can try creating different headlines, adjusting different colors, changing the images and so on to see how the changes affect user engagement. Each variation will show its conversion rate, making it easy to see which one is most effective. After you are satisfied with the results, you can end the split test and pick the most effective variation. For detained information about creating split tests, be sure to read our in-depth split testing tutorial.\n\nDisable\n\nYou can disable an opt-in form at any time without deleting it. Once displayed the form will not be displayed on your website, and will be moved down the page into the inactive opt-ins list. You can save this form for later and re-activate it at a later time.\n\nDuplicate\n\nYou can duplicate a form at any time. If you have spent a lot of time designing a form, and you would like to create a new variation based off that design, or if you would like to create a different opt-in type using the same design settings, you can simply duplicate the opt-in. When you first click the duplicate icon, you will be given the choice between which type of opt-in you would like to create. Even when duplicating, you can change the opt-in type while retaining your design settings.\nDelete – If you no longer want to use an opt-in, it can be permanently deleted.\nModify – You can adjust the settings of an opt-in at any time. Clicking the modify icon will bring you back to the opt-in creation screen where you can adjust the opt-in settings using the Setup, Design and Display tabs.\n\nBloom Statistics\n\nOnce you have created your opt-ins, the next step is to understand their effectiveness. Using the Bloom stats page, you can get a great idea about how well each of your opt-in forms are performing, as well as how fast your email list is growing as a whole.\n\nThe Bloom stats page has a lot of great information, such as overall growth stats, a detailed overview of each opt-in form’s performance, a historical graph about your list growth, as well as information about your highest performing pages.\nThis has been a basic overview of Bloom, and we have only touched on the general concept behind creating opt-in forms. For each section above, we have deatiled tutorials that go in-depth into each setting and how they work. Be sure to browser though the rest of our tutorials found within the Bloom Documentation page."
