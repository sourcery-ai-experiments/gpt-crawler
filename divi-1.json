Once you choose an option you can also adjust the duration, delay, opacity, and speed of the animation and whether you want it to continually repeat or just happen once.\n\nAdvanced Settings\n\nThis is where the advanced customization settings are for this module.\n\nCSS ID & Classes\n\nThis is where you can assign a specific CSS ID or class to this module. You can add multiple CSS Classes, but only one CSS ID. This is helpful if you are writing custom code in the page’s settings, Divi’s Custom CSS block in the Theme Options, or in a child theme style.css file.\n\nCustom CSS\n\nYou can also apply custom CSS to this module by pasting CSS properties it in this tab. When you click on the Custom CSS tab, you’ll see individual sections where you can add CSS rules to specific elements in the module.\n\nConditions\n\nThis tab allows you to choose when to display this module based on a set of conditions, like what time a user is visiting the page if they’ve already purchased from your company before, what browser they are using, what operating system they’re using, and more. You can add one condition or multiple conditions.\n\nVisibility\n\nThis defines the visibility of the module. You can choose to disable it (hide it from view) when the display window is a Phone, Tablet, or Desktop by clicking the corresponding checkbox. You can also determine how you want overflow content to be displayed if the content overflows the element that it is in. You can choose visible, scroll, hidden, or auto for both horizontal and vertical content. By default, “auto” is selected.\n\nTransitions\n\nThis controls the transition duration of the hover animation as well as the delay, and speed curve.\n\nPosition\n\nThis defines the position of the module as well as the offset origin, vertical and horizontal offsets, and the z-index of the module. The available positions are default (which is automatically selected), relative, absolute, and fixed. Defining the z-index allows you to specify the stack order of elements. Elements with a higher z-index number overlap elements with a lower z-index.\n\nScroll Effects\n\nThis defines how the module behaves upon scroll. You can make the module sticky (to top, bottom, or top and bottom), and choose if the module transforms upon scroll. You can also enable vertical motion on this module which allows you to adjust the speed at which this element scrolls (making it faster or slower) without affecting the surrounding elements. The Motion Trigger Effect allows you to choose when the scroll effect you just applied is triggered: when the top of the element is in view, the middle, or the bottom.\n\nMore Resources for the Divi Woo Product Rating Module\nHow to Install WooCommerce & Set Up Your Shop\nHow to Configure WooCommerce Settings\n5 eCommerce Personalization Ideas for WooCommerce\nWooCommerce Performance Optimization: 14 Tips & Best Practices\nA Simple Guide to WooCommerce’s Default Pages\nUpdating WooCommerce: Best Practices to Follow Every Time\nContinue Learning\nLearn The Divi Basics\nBrowse Divi Documentation\nDivi WooCommerce Modules Documentation\nStay up to date with all of our latest Divi Woo Product Rating tutorials by checking out our #WooProductRating page."

This will allow you to utilize the power of Divi to add, remove, and style the WooCommerce Elements that make up a product page layout to create completely custom product pages from scratch. No more having to resort to external CSS or modifying woocommerce page templates with custom code.\n\nWooCommerce Modules aren’t limited to product pages either. You can add Woo Modules anywhere on your site to showcase related products dynamically, create custom add to cart buttons for a particular product, create a completely custom product galleries, and much much more.\n\nIf that wasn’t enough, WooCommerce data is also available via Divi’s dynamic content feature that is built in to all Divi Modules. That means you can easily pull in woocommerce elements and product information to any module in Divi. For example, if you don’t want to use the Woo Tabs module to display your product’s additional information, you can add it to a Divi toggle module with dynamic content.\n\nHow WooCommerce Modules Work\n\nWooCommerce Modules work in much the same way as dynamic content works already within the Divi Builder. Each WooCommerce Module requires you to select a product to generate dynamic content associated with that product. The dynamic content is pulled from the database and includes the information that you entered when setting up your product in woocommerce. Once a product is selected, you can use the Divi Builder settings to style the dynamic WooCommerce product content like you would any regular Divi module.\n\nAccessing WooCommerce Modules from the Divi Builder\n\nWooCommerce Modules are accessible from within the Divi Builder just like regular Divi Modules.\n\nOnce the Divi Theme has been installed on your website, you will notice a Use Divi Builder button above the post editor every time you are building a new product or page. Clicking this button will enable the Divi Builder, giving you access to all of the Divi Builder’s modules including WooCommerce Modules. If you are enabling the Divi Builder on a WooCommerce Product page, Woo Modules will automatically replace the Woo Elements that were active on the page before enabling Divi. You can also click the Build On The Front End button to launch the builder in Visual Mode. You can also click the Enable Visual Builder button when browsing your website on the front end if you are logged in to your WordPress Dashboard.\n\nOnce you have entered the Divi Builder, you can click the gray plus button to add a new module to your page. Locate the Woo modules within the list of modules and click on one to add it to your page.\n\nThe module list is searchable, which means you can also type “woo” to see all Woo Modules or type “Woo Title” to quickly pull up the Woo Title module!\n\nOnce the module has been added, you will be greeted with the module’s list of options just like a normal Divi module. These options are separated into three main groups: Content, Design and Advanced.\n\nUsing WooCommerce Modules on Product Pages\n\nDivi’s Woo Modules will work seamlessly with a WooCommerce Product Page. Below is an overview of how to use Woo Modules on a product page in Divi.\n\nBy default, Divi will use the default WooCommerce Product Page template which isn’t editable using the Divi Builder.\n\nHere is what the default product page looks like when editing it on the backend.\n\nThe only thing you need to do to enable Woo Modules on your page is to enable the Divi Builder on the Product Page by clicking the “Use the Divi Builder” button.\n\nOnce you enable the Divi Builder on a Product Page for a normal product, Divi will automatically convert the product page elements into a collection of WooCommerce modules that mimic the default Divi product page design. For each one of the Woo Elements that are relevant to your product, Divi has a corresponding WooCommerce Module that allows you to deploy and design that Woo Element with the Power of the Divi Builder. For example, the product title is replaced with a new Woo Title module that has all the design options available to customize the title with Divi.\n\nHere is what it looks like when you enable the Divi Builder on a Product page.\n\nThe user is then free to customize all of the WooCommerce elements (like product images, price, description, etc.) using the Divi builder. This will allow you to create completely custom product pages.\n\nIt is important to remember that every Woo Module is dynamic which means it is dependant on existing woocommerce data that you have already entered when building your products. So you will need to make sure the product has the information needed to display the module. For example, if you haven’t included any upsell products for a particular product, you wouldn’t be able to add or customize the woo upsell module on that particular product page because there is nothing to display.\n\nDivi Page Settings for Product Pages\n\nOnce the Divi Builder has been deployed on a product page, the Divi Page Settings will contain slightly different options. The two main options to take note of, especially when working with Woo Modules, are Page Layout and Product Content.\n\nPage Layout\n\nUse this option to change the product page layout.\nThe Left Sidebar and Right Sidebar options will display the default Divi Theme sidebar.\n\nIf you want to hide the sidebar, you can select the No Sidebar or Fullwidth option.\n\nOne thing you may consider doing is selecting a creating a custom sidebar using the Divi Builder with a Fullwidth Page layout.\n\nProduct Content\n\nThe Product Content settings allows you to choose between two options:\n\nDefault\nBuild from scratch\n\nThe default option will enable the old way the Divi Builder worked with WooCommerce Product Pages. Basically the Divi Builder will allow you to add content only in the description area of the default WooCommerce Page Layout.\n\nThe Build from Scratch option is what enables the functionality of Woo Modules to override the default WooCommerce Product Page Layout. There really is no reason to switch from the Build From Scratch option unless you need to revert back to the old way of doing things.\n\nUsing Woo Modules on Normal Pages and Posts\n\nDivi’s WooCommerce Modules can be used on any normal page or post throughout your website (not just WooCommerce Product Pages).\n\nFor example, you can easily add a Woo Add To Cart button for a specific product in your store to a custom landing page you created for the product.\n\nSimply add a the Woo Add to Cart module to the page like you would any other Divi Module.\n\nThen make sure you select the product you want to link to the module.\n\nIn this case, I want to select a specific product. Therefore I would need to search the dropdown list of products within the module to find a specific product in the WooCommerce database.\n\nThis would of course be the product I want featured on the landing page. The module will then fetch the product data dynamically and, in this case, add the product to the cart when clicking the button.\n\nYou can also combine multiple WooCommerce Modules together for completely custom layouts for your product information. For example, you may want to feature a product using multiple Woo Modules that are all linked to the same product so that the information updates dynamically.\n\nHere is an example of a landing page that uses 6 Woo Modules that are all featuring information for the same product dynamically.\n\nAnd since each Woo Module is styled using Divi’s powerful built-in design settings, you can get a great looking featured product section for your landing page.\n\nWoo Modules with Other WooCommerce Pages\n\nThe woocommerce modules will also work on other WooCommerce Pages as well. These include the Shop, Checkout, and Cart pages. For example, you could feature special products on the WooCommerce Account page so that only users with an account can see them.\n\nAnd don’t forget to think outside the box. You can definitely use Divi modules to create your own custom version of a shop page.\n\nUnderstanding Each Woo Module and Their Settings\nUnderstanding Woo Module Settings\n\nWoo Module Settings have the same structure and UI as a regular Divi module, complete with three tabs – Content, Design, and Advanced.\n\nContent\n\nThe content options will vary depending on the WooCommerce Module. However, since each WooCommerce Module is built with the same structure as a normal Divi module, the layout and functionality of the Woo Modules will be familiar and intuitive. For the most part, each Woo Module will be pulling content from a particular product. So instead of having a text box for entering static text, you will see a dropdown menu to select the product you want to pull data from.\n\nProduct Selection\n\nThe Content tab will hold helpful options that allow you to choose the product associated with the module. For example, you can keep the default selection, “this product”, on the Woo Title module to display the title of the product on that current product page.\n\nThis is the default choice since you will normally want to display the information for the product associated with that product page.\n\nHowever, you could also choose to display the “Latest Product” which would display the module content for the latest product that was added to your store.\n\nOr, you could select an individual product from the various products that have been created in WooCommerce.\n\nNotice the UI of the product selection popup box. Since you will have many products to choose from in your WC product database, Divi has made finding these products easy by including a search bar at the top and next/previous navigation at the bottom.\n\nCustom Text Content\n\nFor the most part, every Woo Module is relative to a particular product dynamically. This means that the content generated onto the page comes from the information added to your product on the backend in WooCommerce. So selecting a product is all you really need to do in most Woo Modules. However, some Woo Modules will have an option to add custom text content relevant to the module. A good example of this is the Woo Breadcrumbs Module which allows you to add custom text for the home link as well as a custom separator character.\n\nShow/Hide Elements\n\nSome Woo Modules have multiple elements that can be displayed within one module. If this is the case, the Woo Module will allow you to show/hide those specific elements that pertain a WooCommerce module. For example, you in the Woo Tabs module, you can choose to include the description, additional information, and/or reviews in the woocommerce tabs element.\n\nEach Woo Module will also have the content options groups common to most Divi Modules including options for Link, Background, and Admin Label.\n\nDesign\n\nEach WooCommerce Module will have the same powerful design options that are common to all Divi Modules. These include but aren’t limited to the following groups:\n\nText\nSizing\nSpacing\nBorder\nBox Shadow\nFilters\nTransform\nAnimation\n\nWoo Modules will also have design settings specific to that particular Woo module. For example, the Woo Tabs Module has design options for body text and tab text since you would need to style those specific elements.\n\nMore information about the design settings for each Woo Module can be found later in this documentation below.\n\nAdvanced\n\nYou will also have the advanced options common to Divi Modules including:\n\nCSS ID and Classes\nCustom CSS\nVisibility\nTransitions\n\nA Breakdown of Each Woo Module and Their Unique Settings\n\nThere are a total of 16 Woo Modules that each have their own unique settings. Here is the list of those modules.

This means that every Divi Module has the capability of pulling in dynamic content from the woocommerce data stored in your wordpress database. This opens the door for limitless design combinations using regular Divi Modules to style WooCommerce content.\n\nUse Case Tutorial: Building a Product Page With Divi’s Woo Modules\n\nFor this tutorial, we are going to build a simple product page and style it using Divi’s new Woo Modules.\n\nTo get started, we will need to have the Divi Theme (most recent version) installed and active as well as the WooCommerce plugin. If it is the first time setting up WooCommerce, you will need to run through the basic setup wizard to get your store ready. Once done, you are ready to add your new products. You will need at least 3 or 4 products created in order for some modules to display information. For example, the Woo Recent Products module won’t show recent products if there are none. And if you want to showcase upsells with the Woo Upsell module, you will need to add upsell products to a particular product/page for those to show up.\n\nWe can also import WooCommerce sample data to speed up the process if we want to test out the woo modules.\n\nCreating a Product\n\nTo create a new product, go to the WordPress dashboard and navigate to Products > Add New.\n\nThen enter the product information you want displayed on the product page.\n\nFor the Product Data, Select a Simple Product from the dropdown.\n\nThen add the following info:\n\nGeneral\n\nRegular Price: 20\nSale Price: 15\n\nThis info will be displayed by the Woo Price Module.\n\nInventory\n\nSKU: sku-123-1\nSelect Enable stock management at product level\nStock Quantity: 10\n\nThis info will be displayed by the Woo Meta Module along with the Product Categories and Tags.\n\nLinked Products\n\nUpsells: [add three products to serve as mock upsell products]\n\nThis info will be displayed by the Woo Upsell Module.\n\nAttributes\nAdd a custom attribute named “size” with the following values:\n\nLarge\nMedium\nSmall\n\nThen make sure to click the checkbox to make the attribute visible on the product page.\n\nThis info will be displayed by the Woo Additional Information Module and also included in the Woo Tabs module if Additional Information is selected to be displayed.\n\nActivating the Divi Builder on the Product Page\n\nAfter the Product Information has been entered, click to use the Divi Builder.\n\nThis will automatically convert the product page layout into a separate Divi Elements, with each WooCommerce Element converted to a customizable Woo Module. The Divi Builder will populate the area where the long description content used to be. The new location of the long description content will be located at the bottom of the product page.\n\nNOTE: You can always update the product information after deploying the Divi Builder. It will work the same way. In other words, you don’t have to update all of the product information before you deploy the Divi Builder if you don’t want to.\n\nNext, click the button to build on the front end.\n\nDesigning the Woo Modules\n\nNow we are ready to start design each of the Woo Modules to create a custom design of the product page.\n\nWoo Breadcrumb Module Styling\n\nLet’s start at the top of the page with the Woo Breadcrumb module.

Open the Woo Review Module settings and update the following:\n\nStar Rating Text Color: #d039a0\nStar Rating Text Size: 18px\nText Text Color: #31d190\n\nAfter the product rating is styled, open the Woo Price Module settings and update the following:\n\nPrice Font Weight: Ultra Bold\nPrice Text Color: #31d190\n\nWoo Description Styling\n\nNext, update the Woo description module settings as follows:\n\nBackground Color: #f8f8f8\nText Line Height: 1.8em\nMargin: -5% Left\nPadding: 5% top, 5% bottom, 5% left, 5% right\nBox Shadow: See screenshot\n\nWoo Add To Cart Styling\n\nOpen the Woo Add To Cart module settings and update the following:\n\nText Text Color: #d039a0\nFields Text Color: #333333\nFields Font Weight: Bold\n\nThe update the button style as follows:\n\nButton Text Size: 30px\nButton Text Color: #ffffff\nButton Background Color: #31d190\nButton Font Weight: Semi Bold\n\nWoo Meta Module Styling\n\nNext, open the Woo Meta Module settings and update the following:\n\nMeta Font Weight: Semi Bold\nMeta Text Color: #333333\nMeta Text Size: 16px\nMeta Line Height: 1.8em\nLink Font Style: Underline\n\nWoo Tabs Module Settings\n\nOpen the Woo Tabs Module Settings and change the background color as follows:\n\nBackground Color: #f8f8f8\n\nThen update the rest of the design settings as follows:\n\nActive Tab Background Color:\nInactive Tab Background Color: #333333\nActive Tab Text Color: #ffffff\nTab Text Color: #ffffff\nTab Font Weight: Bold\nTab Text Size: 26px (desktop), 18.8px (tablet)\nMax Width: 780px\nModule Alignment: Center\nBorder Width: 0px\nBox Shadow: see screenshot\n\nWoo Upsell Module Settings\n\nThe Woo Upsell Module will display the products added to the Linked Product tab under Product Data when building the product.

You can use this module on a product page template or anywhere on your website.\n\nThis module pulls the stock number from the Inventory section in a product listing.\n\nInstall Divi & WooCommerce\n\nBefore you can add the Divi Woo Product Stock Module to your website, you’ll need to have the Divi theme and WooCommerce installed on your WordPress website. Learn how to install the Divi theme on your WordPress website here and how to install WooCommerce here. For additional information on the Divi Builder itself, its interface, usage philosophy and best practices, please refer to our Getting Started With The Divi Builder guide.\n\nAdd the Divi Product Stock Module\n\nTo load the Divi Woo Product Stock Module click the gray “+” icon to bring up the module library. Click on “Woo Modules” and then click “Woo Product Stock” to add it to your page. Note, the module library is also searchable! Use the search bar at the top of the module library to type in the name of the module you are looking for.\n\nAll Divi Woo Product Stock Module Settings Explained\n\nOnce added, the module settings automatically pop up. This is where all of the content and design styles for this module are configured. These settings are organized into three groups via the tabs at the top of the module: Content, Design, and Advanced.\n\nContent Settings\n\nInside this tab, you’ll find the content options available for this module.\n\nContent\n\nThe first settings group is also called Content, where you can control what type of content is displayed and how.\n\nProduct– This setting allows you to specify which product you want the module to relate to when it shows the product’s stock number. By default, it’s set to “This Product”. For our purposes, we’ll leave this setting set to “This Product” so that it dynamically displays the correct stock number depending on what product is being viewed.\n\nBackground\n\nThis is where you can add a background color, gradient, image, video, pattern, or mask to this module.\n\nHow to Add a Background Color\n\nTo add a background color to the entire module, click the first tab, the paint bucket.

    "html": "Divi Theme Documentation\nENTER SEARCH TERM\nDIVI\nEXTRA\nBLOOM\nMONARCH\nDIVI BUILDER\nDEVELOPERS\nBACK TO DIVI THEME DOCUMENTATION\nThe Divi Theme Builder\n\nUsing the Theme Builder to customize your header, footer and post templates.\n\nIntroduction to the Theme Builder\n\nThe Divi Theme Builder is an interface within Divi that allows you to use the Divi Builder to construct theme templates and assign those custom templates to pages or posts across your theme (including custom post types like Divi Projects and WooCommerce Products and Pages). With the Theme Builder, you have complete control over every single element of your website. And because you have the power to use or exclude templates on any page or post throughout your site, there is really no longer any need to manually edit a theme template file ever again.\n\nIn short, the Divi Theme Builder takes the power of the Divi Builder and extends it to all areas of the Divi Theme, allowing you to build custom headers, footers, category pages, product templates, blog post templates, 404 pages and more.\n\nHere are just a few things you can do with the Theme Builder:\n\nDesign a global header/menu for you entire site from scratch using the Divi Builder.\nDesign a global footer for your entire site from scratch using the Divi Builder.\nBuild a custom 404 page template.\nBuild a custom post template layout for all blog posts using the Divi Builder.\nBuild a custom product page template for all products.\nBuild a custom template for archive pages.\nBuild a custom template for all posts (or products) with a certain category.\nDesign complete theme builder packs (sort of like child themes) that you can export and import into other websites.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCustomizing Templates with the Divi Theme Builder\nDefault Website Template\nBuilding a Global Header\nBuilding a Global Body\nBuilding a Global Footer\nCustom Templates\nAdding a New Template\nManaging Template Assignments\nHow to Handle Global Items on New Templates\nCustom Template Settings\nBuilding a Custom or Global Header from Scratch\nBuilding a Custom or Global Footer from Scratch\nSaving Changes with the Theme Builder\nUsing Dynamic Content within the Theme Builder\nBuilding a Site-Wide Blog Post Template\nBuilding a Site-Wide Product Page\nBuilding a Category Page Template for Blog Posts\nBuilding a 404 Page Template\nBuilding a Search Results Page Template\nPortability Options for Theme Builder Templates\n\nAccessing the Divi Theme Builder\n\nThe Divi Theme Builder can be accessed on the backend within your WordPress dashboard under the Divi category of menu items.\n\nFrom the WordPress dashboard, navigate to Divi > Theme Builder.\n\nThis will bring you to the main Divi Theme Builder interface where you will manage all of your templates.\n\nCustomizing Templates with the Divi Theme Builder\n\nDefault Website Template\n\nBy default, there is a single template item called Default Website Template, which cannot be deleted, but it can be modified. This is the standard theme template, and if left unedited the three areas will use the standard Divi styles. If the Header Area of the Default Website Template is edited, the theme header is replaced across the entire site with the customized Divi Builder content. Same goes for the Body and Footer areas.\n\nDefault Website Template Global Areas\n\nThe default website template is made up of three areas: Global Header, Global Body, and Global Footer.\n\nTo start the process of creating a new template content area, all you need to do is click on one of the respective empty areas.\n\nBuilding a Global Header\n\nIf you would like to add and build a new global header for your website, click the “Add Global Header” area and then select the option “Build Global Header”.\n\nMuch like you would when designing a page in Divi, you are prompted to choose how you would like to start building the layout. For example, you could jump start the design with a premade layout or a header layout you previously designed by selecting the option “Choose a Premade Layout”. However if you want to build the header from scratch, select “Build From Scratch”.\n\nOnce you have selected to build the layout from scratch, you will be brought to the Template Layout Editor. This is where you will use the Divi Builder to design your header layout just like you would design a normal page or post with the Divi Builder.\n\nKeep in mind that whatever you see in this template layout editor will be what shows on the header of your page. And if this is a global header, it will show throughout your entire site by default, replacing the standard Divi header.\n\nOnce you have finished designing your header, make sure to save the layout before you exit the template layout editor.\n\nNow you should see a green Global Header populating the Global Header space of the default website template. The green color is to remind you that it is a global.\n\nYour website will now have a new global header that replaces the standard Divi header.\n\nBuilding a Global Body\n\nIn most cases, you will not want to design a global body area for your default theme template because you will most likely want to have more control over the body on a page by page basis.\n\nFor example, you may want to forego creating a global body area for your default website template (which will be applied to all pages/posts by default), but you may want to create a new template with a custom template body area for all of your blog posts. That way you don’t have to worry about the design of each new post. You only need to add new body content.\n\nTo add a Global Body to your default website template, simply click the “Add Global Body” area and then select the option “Build Global Body”.\n\nThis will bring you to the Template Layout Editor where you can design the Global body area of your website.\n\nIt is important to include the post content module whenever you design the body area of your template. The post content module is what allows Divi to populate the template with the actual page or post content.\n\nThe post content module conveniently displays mock content to make it easy to add styling to the content in anticipation of the actual content for all pages and posts.\n\nThis post content module is essentially a placeholder for the content that is added to the content of a page in Divi. If you are not using Divi Builder on a page, the post content module will display the content within the WYSIWYG editor of a page or post on the backend.\n\nHere is an example of how that content would appear in the Global Body area of the template.\n\nIf you decide to use the Divi Builder to edit a page or post. The area available for the Divi Builder content will be contained within the designated area of the post content module in the body of the template.\n\nThat is why in most cases I wouldn’t suggest having a global body area for your website unless you have a specific reason. You might find creating a Global body will put unnecessary limitations on your ability to design page content in Divi.\n\nIf you do decide to go with a global body area for your default website template, I suggest making sure your post content module spans the fullwidth of the layout so that you aren’t limited in any way by spacing when designing pages with the Divi Builder.\n\nBuilding a Global Footer\n\nThe Divi Theme Builder allows you to replace the standard Divi footer (and footer bar) with a new custom footer that you can design completely from scratch using the Divi Builder.\n\nTo build a global footer for your website, simply click the “Add Global Footer” area and select “Build Global Footer”.\n\nThen use the power of the Divi Builder to design the footer within the Template Layout Editor. Don’t forget to save the layout.\n\nNOTE: You can also choose to add one of our premade layouts to the footer template editor to jumpstart the design of your footer. You can do this at any time by clicking the Add from Library plus icon in the settings menu at the bottom of the editor.\n\nOnce you have a Global Header, Body, and Footer in place, a sample page would look something like this.\n\nGlobal Body Not Necessary\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Global Body isn’t necessary. You can easily delete the Global Body by clicking the trash icon.\n\nWithout the Global Body, you have complete control over the design of your page using the Divi Builder.\n\nOnce you have finished designing your page, the Global Header and Global Footer will still remain while the page content is displayed beautifully as expected.\n\nCustom Templates\n\nThe default website template controls the default template for the entire site. However, custom templates allow you to override the default template by giving a custom template to any page or post on your website. In other words, custom templates allow you to create templates for pages or posts that you don’t want to inherit the default template.\n\nAdding a New Template\n\nTo create a new template, simply click the “Add New Template” box with the gray plus icon.\n\nThis will bring up the Template Settings modal that prompts you to manage the template assignments. In other words, you will need to designate on what pages or posts you want to assign the template. More on this below.\n\nManaging Template Assignments\nUse On vs. Exclude From\n\nThe template assignments can be selected under the “Use on” tab and the “Exclude From” tab. It is up to you whether or not you want to base your assignments on the “Use on” logic or the “Exclude From” logic. But feel free to use a combination of both if needed.\n\nFor example, you can choose to use it on all pages and posts, but also choose to exclude a specific page or post.\n\nNOTE: If an include selection conflicts with an exclude selection, the exclude selection always overrides the include. For example, if you choose to “Include on Homepage” and “Exclude from Homepage”, this template will be excluded from the Homepage.\n\nPick from any theme template.\n\nYou will also find that there are templates for every page, post, and/or archive. You can even assign templates to WooCommerce Pages and Products if you have WooCommerce installed on your site.\n\nMacro Assignments and Micro Assignments\n\nTemplates can be assigned on a macro level and/or micro level. For example, you may choose to assign the template to all pages throughout your site (macro level), or you may choose to assign the template to one specific post (micro level). Or both! You can even select multiple assignments, giving you complete control over where you would like your template assigned throughout you website.\n\nConflicting Assignments\n\nIf the user assigns a template to a page that is already assigned to another template, the newly saved template will take precedence and the previous assignment on the other template will be removed. A warning message will appear notifying you of this before saving the template.\n\nRenaming Custom Templates\n\nOnce all assignments have been selected, you will see a new template name that has been generated based on your selection(s). When hovering over the template card title area, a tooltip appears that shows the list of everything that the template is used on or excluded from. To rename the template, you can click on the template name to edit the title inline.\n\nUnassigned Template Warning\n\nIf you do not select a template assignment, you will see warning text in place of the template name that reads “Unassigned”.\n\nCustom Template Areas\n\nJust like the default website template (or Global template), a custom template will also have the following areas: Header, Body, and Footer.\n\nIf the default website template has global template layouts added to any of the three areas, those global layouts will automatically be added to the new template.\n\nHow to Handle Global Items on New Templates\n\nHowever, you don’t have to keep that Global layout on your new template. You can use the Template area options to delete the layout and build a new one from scratch or disable global and tweak the layout for the specific needs of the layout.\n\nFor example, if you have a Global Header on the default website template, your new template will inherit that Global Header. You can choose to do one of the following:\n\nYou can  use the Global Header on your new template.\n\nYou can disable Global so that you can tweak the design for the custom template.\n\nYou can delete the Global Header and build the Custom header from scratch for the template or add one from the Library.\n\nYou can also choose to leave the Custom Header area empty which will inherit the standard Divi theme header.\nAdding a Template Area from Library\n\nWhen adding a custom template area to your new template, you may choose to add a layout from your Divi library. This functionality mimics the process of adding a new layout to your page when using the Divi Builder. To add a layout to the template area from the library, click the template area and select Add from Library. The add from library popup will appear where you can choose any premade, saved, or existing page layouts. Once the layout has been added to the template area, you can select the gear icon to edit the layout using the Divi Builder within the Template Layout Editor.\n\nDrag and Drop Template “Areas”\n\nTemplate areas can be dragged and dropped to other template content areas. This is a quick and easy way to duplicate and place a template area in one drag and drop action. Dragging doesn’t remove it from the area its being dragged FROM— it only populates or replaces the area it’s dragged TO. Think of it as duplication rather than cut and paste.\n\nTemplate Area Visibility Options: Hiding/Showing Header, Body, and Footer areas.\n\nIn addition to being able to customize each area of a template, you can also toggle an area’s visibility to either show or hide it on the Front End by clicking the “eye” icon next to each area. For example, you could hide the Header Area and Footer Area of your 404 Page.\n\nNOTE: Hiding a template area doesn’t return the area to the default, it completely hides the area altogether on the front end.\n\nCustom Template Settings\nTemplate Settings Menu\n\nWhen hovering over a template within the theme builder, a template settings menu will appear at the top left of the template box. This menu is very similar to the menus you see when hovering over a section, row, or module within the Divi Builder.\n\nThe menu includes icons for the following functions:\n\nTemplate Settings – This is  where you can manage the template assignments\nDuplicate Template – This will duplicate the template in order to jumpstart another custom template. Duplicating a Template triggers the exact same thing that clicking the Add New Template card would do. The difference is that after defining the template settings, the generated template uses the same Header Area, Body Area, and Footer Area as the duplicated template.\nDelete Template – This will delete the template altogether. Any pages, posts, or archives that were assigned the deleted template will revert back to the default website template and/or the standard Divi theme layout for that page (if no default template is created).\nExport Template – You can click the export template icon to export a .json file of that specific template. Once you click the export template icon, enter a name for the export file and click the “Export Divi Theme Builder Template” button.\n\nMore Settings Options – The more settings icon opens a convenient list of all available template settings all in one place.\n\nBuilding a Custom Header\n\nBuilding a custom header will involve the same process as building a global header. The only difference is that a custom header is not global so it only gets displayed on post are pages that have been assigned to the template including the custom header. The header is where you will need to include your primary menu for your website, but you may also add countless elements and designs to your header as well.\n\nFor more info, check out this complete post on how to create a custom global header using Divi’s Theme Builder.\n\nBuilding a Custom Body\n\nBuilding a custom body area for your template involves the same process as building a global body and it can be a great way to add design and/or content to the body of a lot of pages or posts at once. And if you use dynamic content, you can really streamline the design and functionality of your blog posts or WooCommerce Products.\n\nBuilding a Custom Footer\n\nBuilding a custom footer involves the same process as building a global footer. It is important to remember that any custom footer added to a template will completely override Divi’s standard footer including the bottom footer bar.\n\nFor a comprehensive tutorial on how to build a custom footer from scratch, check out our post on how to create a custom footer with Divi’s Theme Builder.\n\nSaving Changes with the Theme Builder\nSaving and Cancelling Template Layouts\n\nWhen you are finished building your template, it is important that you save Template Settings changes. To do this you must click the Save button at the bottom of the modal. If you wish to cancel the changes made to the layout, simply click the X icon in the upper right.\n\nNote: If you click the X icon during a creation flow (without saving), the template layout will not be created or saved.\n\nSaving Theme Builder Changes\n\nJust like with Divi Theme Options, you must save your changes to the Theme Builder in order for those changes to take effect. If you refresh the page or close the window, changes will be cancelled/lost.\n\nUsing Dynamic Content within the Theme Builder\n\nDynamic content (i.e. Title, Featured Image, Post Content, etc.) can be included in your Global or Custom Template layouts. This is a powerful tool that allows you to streamline the design and functionality of website, especially for blog posts and/or WooCommerce Products.\n\nBuilding a Site-Wide Blog Post Template\n\nBlog posts are a great example of where a custom template with dynamic content is needed. This will allow you to design a blog post template that will be applied to all blog posts site wide using the Divi Builder and dynamic content. Once done, all you would need to do is update the actual body content for all future posts. The new post content will inherit the design of the custom template!\n\nHere is a quick example of how to do this:\n\nFirst, create a new template and assign the template to All Posts. Then add a custom body to the template.\n\nUsing the Template Layout Editor, design the entire layout using the Divi Builder combined with Divi’s built-in dynamic content modules and options.\n\nFor example, you could use the Post Title Module to display the title of the post dynamically.\n\nOr use a text module that pulls in the Post Publish Date.\n\nMost importantly, you must include the Post Content module when building any custom body layout for your template. The Post Content module includes the area for page or post content to be displayed within the Body Area of the template.\n\nHere is an illustration of an entire layout for a blog post template using dynamic content:\n\nOnce the template is created, you can easily create a new blog post using the default WordPress post editor and have that blog post inherit the design of the blog post template you created using the Divi Theme Builder.\n\nYou can also use the Divi Builder on blog posts with this custom template as well. It will work the same way. Whatever you build with the Divi Builder for your post will show inside the area designated by the Post Content Module on the template layout.\n\nBuilding a Site-Wide Product Page\n\nDynamic content doesn’t just apply to blog post templates. You can also use Divi’s built-in WooCommerce (or Woo) Modules to build a custom site-wide Product Page Template.\n\nTo do this, simply create a new template and assign the template to “All Products”. Then add a custom body to the template and click to build the body layout using the template editor.\n\nThen use the Divi Builder and the Woo Modules to design the Product page template.\n\nNow whenever, you create a new product on the backend using the standard product page editor, the product will automatically inherit the design of the assigned body template.\n\nBuilding a Category Page Template for Blog Posts\n\nThe Theme Builder also makes it easy to design complete Category Page templates. The key to creating a template for a category page is to create a custom body area and use the Blog Module to display the posts for the current page. This is easily done by a simple click when adding a blog module to the category page template layout.\n\nIf fact you can use a combination of blog modules with post offsets for unique category page layouts.\n\nFor a complete walk through, check out our post on how to build a category page template for your blog using the Divi Theme Builder.\n\nBuilding a 404 Page Template\n\nThe Theme Builder also makes it easy to design a 404 Page template for your Divi website. For a complete walk through, check out our post on how to create a 404 page template using the Divi Theme Builder.\n\nBuilding a Search Results Page Template\n\nThe Theme Builder also makes it easy to design a Search Results Page template for your Divi website. Like category page templates, the key to creating a template for search results is to create a custom body area and use the Blog Module to display the posts for the current page. This is easily done by a simple click when adding a blog module to the category page template layout.\n\nFor a complete walk through, check out our post on how to build a Search Results page template for your website using the Divi Theme Builder.\n\nPortability Options for Theme Builder Templates\nExporting and Importing Templates\n\nUsing the Theme Builder Portability options, you can export all or some of the theme templates in one file. These export files will include all library layouts that are associated with every template and all template assignment data.\n\nTo access the Theme Builder Portability option, click the portability icon on the right of the purple bar at the top of the Theme Builder interface.\n\nThe portability modal will popup with the export tab open by default. Give the export file a name, update the export option (if needed), and click to export the file. If you leave the export option to export all templates, all the theme templates will be exported in the file.\n\nIf you deselect the option to “Export All Templates”, you will see a list of options including specific template you can choose to include in the export file.\n\nTo import a theme builder template json file to your website, you will need to deploy the portability modal and select the import tab. Select the file you’d like to import, update the override options (if needed), and click to import the file.\n\nIMPORTANT: Importing imports everything, even templates that are assigned to pages and posts that don’t exist in the current WP install. All conflicts are resolved by allowing the imported templates to override the existing templates on the website. This means that the Default Template is overridden, and all page or post assignments of the imported templates take precedence. For example, if you import a template that is assigned to the 404 page, it will remove the 404 page from the current template that is assigned to the 404 page.\n\nImport & Export Entire Theme Builder Packs\n\nTheme Builder exports are what we’re calling “Theme Builder Packs”. Think of them like Divi Layout Packs, except for your overall website structure instead of individual page designs. Theme Builder packs remove the need for child themes in many cases and allow you to create pre-built theme templates that can be used on any website.\n\nFor more, check out the complete post on how to use Divi’s Theme Builder portability features."

    "html": "Divi Builder Plugin Documentation\nENTER SEARCH TERM\nDIVI\nEXTRA\nBLOOM\nMONARCH\nDIVI BUILDER\nDEVELOPERS\nBACK TO DIVI BUILDER PLUGIN DOCUMENTATION\nUsing Divi Position Options\n\nDivi’s Position Options make it possible to move page elements independent of their parent container’s limits.\n\nDivi Position Options give you granular control over the position of every element on your page. Position options allow you to move around elements unconstrained from their parent container’s limits. You can design fixed headers and banners, dynamic image collages, and interesting overlapping effects all with Divi’s Position options.\n\nIn this doc, we’ll cover:\nHow To Access Divi Position Options\nHow Position Options Works\nDefault (Static)\nRelative\nAbsolute\nFixed\nUse Draggable Anchors To Reposition Elements On The Page\nTips & Best Practices for Using Divi Position Options\nRelative Length Units Respond Differently\nKeep Important Elements Front And Center As You Scroll\nCreate Custom Fixed Headers In The Theme Builder\nBuild Floating Banners, Buttons & Opt-In Forms\nStack Elements To Create Fun Overlapping Effects\nContinue Learning\nHow To Access Divi Position Options\n\nEvery Divi section, row, and module has a Position settings group under Advanced > Position.\n\nBy default, modules have the default/static position and rows and sections have the relative position by default.\n\nHow Position Options Works\n\nWithin the Position settings group, you’re able to assign a position to the element, including Default, Relative, Absolute, and Fixed.\n\nDefault (Static)\n\nThe default position is the static position. Statically positioned elements stay within the normal flow or order of the elements on the page. They are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties like other positioned elements which is why no offset values are available for elements in the default/static position.\n\nz-Index \n\nThis controls the element position on the Z axis. Elements with a higher z-index number will sit atop elements with lower z-index values.\n\nRelative\n\nRelatively positioned elements can change position without affecting the element’s relationship to the elements around it. The element’s position is relative to itself. That means you can assign top, right, bottom, and left offset properties to move the element around without shifting the surrounding elements.\n\nOffest Origin\n\nThis determines which corner this element is offset from. The vertical and horizontal offset adjustments will be affected based on the element’s offset origin.\n\nVertical Offset\n\nHere you can adjust the element’s position upwards or downwards from its starting location, which may differ based on its offset origin.\n\nHorizontal Offset\n\nHere you can adjust the element’s position left or right from its starting location, which may differ based on its offset origin.\n\nZ-Index\n\nThis controls the element position on the Z axis. Elements with a higher z-index number will sit atop elements with lower z-index values.\n\nAbsolute\n\nThe absolute position breaks the element free from its static position and instead allows the element to be moved around relative to its parent container. Absolutely positioned elements act like they are floating on the page. They are not restricted by their parent container limits and are positioned relative to the nearest positioned parent container. When an element has an absolute position it’s removed from its parent container and the parent container will “collapse” as if there is nothing inside it.\n\nLocation\n\nHere you can adjust the element’s starting location within its parent container. You can further adjust the element’s position using the offset controls.\n\nVertical Offset\n\nHere you can adjust the element’s position upwards or downwards from its starting location, which may differ based on its offset origin.\n\nHorizontal Offset\n\nHere you can adjust the element’s position left or right from its starting location, which may differ based on its offset origin.\n\nZ-Index\n\nThis controls the element position on the Z axis. Elements with a higher z-index number will sit atop elements with lower z-index values.\n\nFixed\n\nElements with a fixed position stay in one position on the web page and are relative to the browser window or viewport, not to a parent container. This position can be used to create “sticky” elements such as fixed headers or a floating banner that stay visible as you scroll down the page. Fixed position elements break out of the normal flow of the page and have no actual space created within the page.\n\nLocation\n\nHere you can adjust the element’s starting location within its parent container. You can further adjust the element’s position using the offset controls.\n\nVertical Offset\n\nHere you can adjust the element’s position upwards or downwards from its starting location, which may differ based on its offset origin.\n\nHorizontal Offset\n\nHere you can adjust the element’s position left or right from its starting location, which may differ based on its offset origin.\n\nZ-Index\n\nThis controls the element position on the Z axis. Elements with a higher z-index number will sit atop elements with lower z-index values. Because fixed elements will often hover behind or in front of other elements on the page, Z Index will help order fixed elements above others.\n\nUse Draggable Anchors To Reposition Elements On The Page\n\nWhen you change an element’s position to Relative, Absolute or Fixed, a new draggable anchor will appear when you hover over the element. This allows you to drag modules, rows and sections right on the page to change their position. As you reposition the element, its X and Y Offset is adjusted within the module settings. As with all Divi settings, the X and Y Offset controls can be adjusted on desktop, tablet and smartphone independently, allowing you to use position options to create responsive designs.\n\nTips & Best Practices For Using Divi Position Options\n\nWhen using Divi Position options, keep these tips and best practices in mind.\n\nRelative Length Units Respond Differently\n\nIf we are using relative length units (like % or vw) for responsive design, these will work differently with relative position and transform translate.\n\nA Divi module with a relative position and a horizontal offset of 50% will move the module horizontally the amount equal to 50% of the width of the parent container (or column).\n\nKeep Important Elements Front And Center As You Scroll\n\nUsing fixed positions allows you to create floating elements, such as fixed headers or floating banners. Fixed elements can be positioned anywhere within the browser viewport and will remain fixed to that location as you scroll down the page. You can make any element fixed and some common uses include: Fixed headers, floating opt-in forms and lead generation forms, sticky buttons, important notices and more.\n\nCreate Custom Fixed Headers In The Theme Builder\n\nOne of the best uses of the new fixed position options is the creation of fixed headers in the Divi Theme Builder. You can create fixed menu modules or you can build an entirely custom header and make the whole section sticky.\n\nBuild Floating Banners, Buttons & Opt-In Forms\n\nAnything can utilize the new fixed position options, not just headers. You can create fixed opt-in forms, lead generation forms or floating call-to-actions. If there is something important that you want to remaining accessible for your visitors, you can fix it to their browser viewport so that it’s always a click away.\n\nStack Elements To Create Fun Overlapping Effects\n\nWhen you change an element’s position to Relative or Absolute, it allows that element to be moved around the page freely without disrupting the elements around it. You can even stack modules on top of each other to create overlapping effects and image collages.\n\nContinue Learning\nUnderstanding & Using the Relative Position in Divi\nA Guide to Understanding & Using the Fixed Position in Divi\nA Guide to Understanding & Using Divi’s Absolute Position\nHow to Use Divi’s Position Options to Create Image Bundles\nHow to Create a Fixed Header with Divi’s Position Options\nHow to Create an Interactive Image Collage Using Divi’s Position Options\nHow to Build a Responsive Fixed Sidebar with Smooth Scrolling Anchor Links with Divi\nHow to Create a Fixed Footer Bar for Your Divi Theme\nHow to Create Mobile Sticky Footer Bars in Divi"

If you have spent a ton of time building an awesome page using the builder, and you think that you might want to build something similar in the future, then you can save your creation as a template for future use. When the saved layout is loaded on a blank page, all of the section, rows and modules that you created previously will appear. You can also load saved layouts onto a page that already has builder content. For example, if you have a repeating element on all of your pages (such as a call to action near the footer of your page), you could save a layout with that CTA already built and then add to all of your existing pages, and use it as a starting point for all future pages.\n\nSaving A Layout\n\nOnce you have created a layout, you can save it for later use by click the “Save Layout” button at the bottom of the builder interface. Once you click the save layout icon, a popup will prompt you to name and save your layout. Type in your desired name, which will be used to identify the layout when loading it in the future, and click the save button. That’s it! Your layout has now been saved.\n\nLoading A Saved Layout\n\nOnce you have saved a layout, you can load it at any time by clicking on it in the load from library popup. Loading a layout will populate the page that you are editing with the sections, rows and modules that you saved in the layout. When you load a saved layout, it will delete whatever content is currently on your page and replace it with the save layout unless you uncheck the “replace the existing content with loaded layout” option before loading."

    "html": "Divi Theme Documentation\nENTER SEARCH TERM\nDIVI\nEXTRA\nBLOOM\nMONARCH\nDIVI BUILDER\nDEVELOPERS\nBACK TO DIVI THEME DOCUMENTATION\nDivi Global Presets\n\nLearn how to create Divi Presets and apply them to modules across your entire website.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAn Overview of Divi’s Global Presets Feature\nUsing Global Presets in Divi\nThe Global Preset Dropdown Menu\nGlobal Preset Item Menu\nAdding New Presets\nUpdating Existing Presets\nOther Settings ( or Right-Click) Options\nConditional Logic within Global Presets\nGlobal History States\nImporting Elements with Global Presets\n\nAn Overview of Divi’s Global Presets Feature\nA Powerful Replacement for Global Defaults\n\nGlobal presets is a powerful evolution of global defaults, taking Divi’s global settings and styles to a whole new level. Instead of allowing one global default for an element, Global Presets allows multiple defaults called “presets” to be used for any element in Divi. For example, let’s say you have a site with three main button designs used throughout. You can give each of those three button designs their own global preset (ie. “button preset 1 “, “button preset 2”, “button preset 3”). Now every time you create a new button, you can choose from one of those global presets.\n\nFurthermore, when you update the design of one preset, it updates every instance of that preset site-wide. Global presets speed up the design process both on a local and global scale.\n\nThe Preset Settings Dropdown Menu\n\nGlobal Presets exist within the settings modal of any Divi element. To access the global presets for a specific Divi element, open the settings and click the preset dropdown menu at the top of the modal under the heading.\n\nWithin the dropdown, you will have the option to create a new preset or update the current default preset.\n\nLocal Side vs Global Preset Side\n\nWhen updating the global presets for an element in Divi, you have the option of deploying the Global Preset Settings modal for that element. This Global Preset Setting Modal will have a gray header to make it easy to determine that you are editing global preset options, rather than options that only apply to the element locally.\n\nThe global preset dropdown menu and options are identical in both the local settings modal and the global presets settings modal. This will make it easy to update global presets no matter what side you are currently working from.\n\nUsing Global Presets in Divi\nThe Global Preset Dropdown Menu\n\nBy default, the Global Preset Dropdown Menu will include only the default preset which will, of course, already be selected.\n\nList of Presets\n\nOnce more presets are added, the dropdown menu will list the available global presets for that element. The default global preset will remain listed at the top of the dropdown along with the name of the preset it is based on.\n\n“Star” and “Checkmark” Icons\n\nNext to certain presets in the list, you will notice a star icon and a check icon. The star icon identifies the preset that is being used as the default preset. The green checkmark icon identifies the active preset (or the preset currently being used by the element).\n\nButtons for Creating New Presets\n\nAlso included in the presets dropdown are two main buttons. Click the “Create New Preset From Current Styles” button if you want to jumpstart the preset with the designs currently active on the element. Or, click the “Add New Preset” button to add a new preset from scratch.\n\nGlobal Preset Item Menu\n\nWhen hovering over an individual global preset within the dropdown, the item will turn blue and a menu with additional options will appear.\n\nThis menu item include the following options:\n\nEdit\nSettings\nUpdate Preset with current styles\nDuplicate\nDelete\nAssign as default\n\nEdit Preset Styles\n\nThe Edit icon will deploy the global preset side of the element (with a nice flip animation). There you can update the design of that particular global preset.\n\nPreset Settings\n\nThe gear icon will open the Preset Settings where you can edit the name of the preset or assign the preset to default.\n\nUpdate Preset With Current Styles\n\nThe update icon allows you to update the global preset with the current styles of the element. This is a quick way to apply the design you are working on to an existing preset. And since this will have an effect on all elements using this global preset site-wide, there is a helpful “Are You Sure?” notification that will popup before applying the update.\n\nDuplicate Preset\n\nThe duplicate icon will clone the preset and open the preset settings of the duplicate so that you can give it a proper name or assign it as the default. This is a great option for creating a new preset without having to start the design from scratch.\n\nDelete Preset\n\nThe delete icon will delete the preset. The “Are You Sure?” notification will remind you that you are deleting a preset that affects the entire site. And, if the deleted preset happens to be the one used as the default, a new preset will take its place as the default preset for that element.\n\nAssign Preset as Default\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the star icon indicates the default preset. Clicking on the star icon within the preset’s menu will assign that preset as the default.\n\nAdding New Presets\n\nDivi gives you a few options for adding a new global preset. These include creating a new preset from scratch, creating a new preset using the current styles of the element, or duplicating an existing preset.\n\nFrom Scratch\n\nTo create a new preset from scratch, select the Add New Preset button from the preset dropdown. Update the preset settings for the new preset (preset name and/or assign as default). Then use the new preset’s menu to make further changes like editing the preset’s styles or updating the preset with the current styles of the element.\n\nFrom Current Style\n\nIf you have an element that is already styled, you can choose to make that element a new global preset by clicking the button labeled “Create New Preset From Current Styles.” This is more convenient when working with existing designs and you want to jumpstart a new preset design.\n\nDuplicating Another Preset\n\nAs mentioned earlier, you can use the duplicate icon to clone an existing preset which will give you a jump start on designing a new one.\n\nUpdating Existing Presets\n\nThere are multiple methods for updating the design of an existing global preset in Divi. This gives the user more power to update the design in a way that makes the most sense to them.\n\nEditing a Preset’s Settings\n\nThe most direct way to update an existing preset is to click the edit icon on the preset’s menu. This will flip the element into its global preset modal where you can update the settings for that specific global preset.\n\nUpdate Preset With Current Styles\n\nAs mentioned earlier, you can update the settings of an existing preset using the update icon. The update icon allows you to update the global preset with the current styles of the element. This a quick way to apply the design you are working on to an existing preset.\n\nOther Settings ( or Right-Click) Options\nEdit Preset Style\n\nIn addition to the global preset menu items, you can also use the “Other Settings” or “right-click” menu to edit an existing preset style. Once you open the menu, click the “Edit Preset Style” option. This will open the global preset modal settings for the preset assigned to that element (same as clicking the edit icon on the preset item menu).\n\nApply Styles to Current Preset\n\nThe “Other Settings” menu also includes the option “Apply Styles to Active Preset.” This is basically the same as the “Update preset with current styles” option available in the preset item menu. However, this option may be more convenient if you don’t want to open the settings of a particular element to apply the change.\n\nApplying Option Group to Current Preset\n\nUse the “Other Settings” menu for an option group/toggle to apply the styles of that particular option group to the active preset.\n\nApplying Single Style Option to Current Preset\n\nAlso, you can use the “Other Settings” menu to apply a single option to the active preset. For example, you may need to adjust the text size for a particular preset. To do this, open the “Other Settings” menu next to the option, and select “Apply Style to Active Preset.”\n\nChoosing Different Presets\n\nOnce you have multiple presets available for an element, you can easily choose a different preset for that element by clicking the preset within the list.\n\nConditional Logic within Global Presets\n\nNormally, when updating the settings of an element, certain options are only available based on conditional logic. For example, icon styles are only available when a user selects to use an icon instead of an image for the blurb module. Having this functionality cleans things up by not including options that don’t apply to the design.\n\nHowever, when editing the global presets for an element, the conditional logic (which normally hides or shows options based on the logic) is ignored. This allows users to design global presets for all options that may or may not be used when adding the element to the site.\n\nAs you can see in the illustration below, the icon styles are available for the blurb preset even though an image is being used.\n\nGlobal History States\n\nMake a mistake with presets? Don’t worry. You can control history states for site-wide changes with Global History States. To access the editing history modal, click the clock icon in the settings menu. Then select the Global History States tab within the History modal. There you will be able to select different site-wide states to undo mistakes. A new state will be added to the list each time you save and confirm a global preset change to a module, row, or section. All you need to do is select the state from the list to revert back to previous states.\n\nImporting Elements with Global Presets\n\nWhen you import an element with global presets to the Divi library, you will have the option to include or exclude the global presets. To do this, navigate to Divi > Divi Library. Then click the Import & Export button. In the portability popup, select the import tab. Then select the file to import, select “Import Presets.” Then click the import button.\n\nThe “Imported” Suffix\n\nWhen you export or import an element with global presets, the imported elements global presets will automatically be renamed with the suffix “imported.”"

    "html": "Divi Builder Plugin Documentation\nENTER SEARCH TERM\nDIVI\nEXTRA\nBLOOM\nMONARCH\nDIVI BUILDER\nDEVELOPERS\nBACK TO DIVI BUILDER PLUGIN DOCUMENTATION\nUsing Divi Visibility Options\n\nThe Divi Visibility Options give you control over when elements are visible or hidden.\n\nThe Divi Visibility Options give you control over when elements are visible or hidden. This is helpful when you want to show or hide certain content based on what device your visitor is using. Within the Divi Visibility Options, you have the power to show or hide content based on viewport device size. You also have the option to control how you display overflow content. Inside the Divi Visibility Options, you’ll find two different ways to help you gain control over how your design looks and works across all screen sizes.\n\nHow To Access Visibility Options\n\nVisibility options are available in all sections, rows, columns, and modules. There are several ways to access the Divi Visibility Options. Let’s take a look at the options.\n\nWithin the Element’s Settings\n\nOpen up the element’s settings and navigate to Advanced > Visibility. Here, you’ll have the option to disable that element on Phone, Tablet, or Desktop by clicking the corresponding checkmarks.\n\nRight-Click\n\nYou can also quickly access the Divi visibility options by right-clicking on the design element. Continue by clicking on Design and selecting which devices you want the element to be hidden on.\n\nDisabled Elements Display At 50% Opacity\n\nWhen you choose to disable an element, that element will display at 50% opacity in the Visual Builder when you view it on the specified viewport. For example, if you choose to hide an element on a Tablet size device, that element will be at 50% opacity on a tablet preview, but at 100% opacity on a desktop preview.\n\nHow the Divi Visibility Options Work\n\nThe Divi Visibility options include hiding elements on device viewport sizes, but also the option to hide or show overflow content. Let’s take a look at both of these settings.\n\nDisabling an Element on a Device\n\nWith the Divi Visibility Options, you can choose to hide elements on a specific device. This is helpful when a design element looks great on a desktop but not so great on mobile devices. In this case, you can use the Divi Visibility Options to hide that element on phone and tablet devices.\n\nTo disable an element per device, simply click the checkbox next to the device you want the element disabled on.\n\nDevice Viewport Sizes\n\nDivi determines device viewport sizes (the width of the device) as follows:\n\nDesktop: 981px or bigger\nTablet: 980px and not smaller than 768px\nPhone: 767px or less\n\nSetting the Content Overflow of Elements\n\nIn CSS, everything is in a box. When content goes outside of that box it’s called overflow. There are two types of overflow: vertical (the y axis) and horizontal (the x axis).  Within the Divi Visibility Options, you have the choice of how you display overflow content. Setting the overflow property determines what happens to the overflow content (whether it’s hidden or a scroll bar appears, etc). Take a look at the visual aid below for a demonstration of the overflow property options: default, visible, scroll, hidden, and auto.\n\nHorizontal Overflow\n\nHorizontal overflow is when the content exceeds the x-axis of its parent element (aka the content is too wide for the container it’s in). This can occur when the parent element has a specified width or max-weidth that is too small to contain all of the content.\n\nSetting an element’s horizontal overflow determines what should happen if the content overflows an element’s container on the X axis (the horizontal axis).\n\nDefault and Visible means the overflow content is not clipped, it will render outside of the element’s container.\nScroll means a scroll bar will appear for the overflow content.\nHidden means the overflow content is clipped and invisible.\nAuto means if overflow content is clipped a scrollbar should appear to see the rest of the content.\n\nFor Example: The example below shows text content that is too wide for the parent element with a max-width of 600px. Below are two examples of horizontal overflow: hidden and scroll.\n\nVertical Overflow\n\nVertical overflow is when the content exceeds the y-axis of its parent element (aka the content is too tall for the container it’s in). This can occur when the parent element has a specified height or max-height that is too small to contain all of the content.\n\nSetting an element’s vertical overflow determines what should happen if the content overflows an element’s container on the Y axis (the vertical axis).\n\nDefault and Visible means the overflow content is not clipped, it will render outside of the element’s container.\nScroll means a scroll bar will appear for the overflow content.\nHidden means the overflow content is clipped and invisible.\nAuto means if overflow content is clipped a scrollbar should appear to see the rest of the content.\n\nFor Example: The illustration below shows a text module with a height of 150px and a vertical overflow set to scroll. Here you can see that the content is too long for the box, so a scroll bar appears in order to show the rest of the content.\n\nTips & Best Practices for Using Divi’s Visibility Options\nSimplify Mobile Design\n\nWhat looks great on desktops doesn’t always look great on mobile. Elements can become smushed, too small, and not render well. Simplifying your design for mobile devices is easy with the Divi Visibility Options.\n\nCheck out the example below. Here we have a section designed with two images and a body of text beneath it. On mobile, stacking two images on one another is not necessary and takes up too much visual space on small mobile devices. Disabling one image from showing on mobile devices delivers a simplified version of your design that looks great for mobile.\n\nContinue Learning\nHow to Reveal Images Using Horizontal Hover Grids & Hidden Overflow with Divi\nHow to Create a Scroll Container for Your Divi Comments Module\n3 Helpful Ways to Use Overflow Options in Divi\nHow to Reveal Images Using Horizontal Hover Grids & Hidden Overflow with Divi"

A good way to think about Mega Menus is that they are drop down menus within drop down menus. So instead of your normal dropdown menu which shows a submenu when hovering over your main parent links in your navigation bar, a megamenu allows you to have additional parent links and submenus within the dropdown menu.\n\nHow To Add A Mega Menu To Your Navigation Bar\n\nLog in to your WordPress dashboard and go to Appearances > Menus.\n\nCreate a menu with four parent links with each of the parent links having their own submenu links. In the example below I’m adding three submenu items under each of the four parent menu links.\n\nCreate an additional link to serve as your megamenu link. For the example below I’m calling this link “Features”. Then drag the four parent menu links (each with their submenu links) over under the Features link.\n\nNow in order to make your Megamenu you have to add a special CSS class to the main top tier link called “Features”. You can do that by clicking the screen options link of the top your page and making sure the CSS class option is checked.\n\nFinally, you need to add a css class to the “Features” link you just created. Click the arrow on the right of the “Features” menu item to toggle the additional configuration options. Find the text box labeled CSS Classes and enter the class “mega-menu”.\n\nNow when you reload your page you can see that all those previous menus have been placed in the one giant menu under this one link, the Mega Menu."

    "title": "The Divi Color Management System | Elegant Themes Documentation",
    "url": "https://www.elegantthemes.com/documentation/divi/color-management-system/",
    "html": "Divi Theme Documentation\nENTER SEARCH TERM\nDIVI\nEXTRA\nBLOOM\nMONARCH\nDIVI BUILDER\nDEVELOPERS\nBACK TO DIVI THEME DOCUMENTATION\nThe Divi Color Management System\n\nHow to use Divi’s sophisticated color options.\n\nDivi’s color management system has evolved over the years to become one of the most robust color systems in the WordPress universe. Divi’s magic color system combined with the ability to edit and create saved, global, and recent color palettes based on user interaction is truly unparalleled.\n\nUnderstanding Divi’s Color Management System\n\nThe Divi color manager has three color palettes that are always at your disposal no matter where you’re accessing color options throughout Divi’s visual builder: Saved colors, Global colors, and Recent colors.\n\nSaved Colors\n\nSaving colors can be accomplished by setting a default color palette in Divi’s theme options. To set your colors, navigate to Divi > Theme Options > General > Color Pickers Default Palette.\n\nOnce colors are saved, they are accessible to you anywhere within the Visual Builder’s color options under the saved tab.\n\nYou can also edit your Saved color palette directly in the Visual Builder. First, click the gear icon next to the color palette options.\n\nTo edit a color, click on the edit icon to changed the color.\n\nWhen you’re finished editing the color or colors in the palette, click the Finish Editing Saved Colors link to save your changes.\n\nGlobal Colors\n\nWhen accessing color options in the Visual Builder, the color palette next to Saved is called Global. Global colors in Divi are designed to give you the ability to assign and edit colors across your entire site with ease. When you change a global color, any element across your entire website using that global color will change too. This makes it possible to make sweeping yet consistent design choices from anywhere you can access color options in Divi.\n\nBuilding a (Dynamic) Global Color Palette\n\nBeing able to build a dynamic global palette is an excellent feature of the Divi Color Management System. Global colors can be accessed by clicking on the global tab in your module’s color settings. Assigning a global color to elements is an easy way to keep colors consistent, and to make changes to your design if you decide to go with a different color scheme. To assign a global color to any element, click into the module and head over to the design tab. Bring up the element’s color settings by clicking on the global tab.\n\nYou can create a global color by clicking on the + icon located just above the global color tab.\n\nThe Divi color picker will appear allowing you to either enter a hex code for your new global color, or by clicking into the color picker to choose one. Once you make a color selection, simply click the green check button next to the color’s hex code to save it.\n\nYou can add as many global colors as you would like. Once saved, global colors are located under the color picker. They are identified by the white triangle in the lower right corner of the color swatch.\n\nYou can then choose any global color and assign it to your element. Once a global color is applied, you can easily change it to another color of your choice. As previously mentioned, elements with global colors applied will change dynamically when a global color is edited.\n\nRecent Colors\n\nThe third color palette that is always available in the Divi Color Management System is your recent color palette. To access it simply click on any color option within a module, column, row, or section and click on the recent tab. There you will find colors recently used during the design process.\n\nMagic Color Suggestions\n\nThere is a fourth and final essential feature to Divi’s Color Management System: Magic Color Suggestions.\n\nUsing Divi’s proprietary algorithm, recent and saved colors are magically transformed into dynamic color palette extensions full of harmonious colors. This one-of-a-kind color system enhances the design process and enables creativity by providing color suggestions based on the colors you’re already using.\n\nEach color row is unique and based on either a recent or saved color. The possibilities are endless and can be used for many different situations such as developing a new color palette or editing an existing one.\n\nAccessing the magic color system is easy. Simply expand the color palette by clicking on the ellipses or 3-dot menu under the eyedropper containing the active color.\n\nOnce expanded, each color is displayed in its own row, and are based on similar or compatible colors. Each row is unique, and provides quick access to nearly unlimited color suggestions for your design.\n\nUsing Divi’s Color Management System\n\nDivi’s Color Management System allows users to update the default palette with colors that you can update anywhere in the Visual Builder. This is a great feature during the design process, especially if you change your mind on your color palette. Unlike the default palette, there’s no need to leave the Visual Builder to make changes. You can select, edit, and apply color changes on the fly.\n\nHow to Change Static Colors to Global Colors\n\nWith Divi’s magic color management system and global color options, it’s easy to build a dynamic color palette to create a beautiful design for your website. Once you’ve chosen a palette, static colors can be converted to global ones. For example, this can be done with any of Divi’s layout pack designs.\n\nTo convert a static color to a global color, select any module, column, row, or section on the page. Select the global color tab next to saved and recent colors. To set a color as global, right click and choose convert to global.\n\nAlternatively, you can click the global tab, then the + icon located next to the last global color listed. Simply click the green check button next to the hex code to save it. This will add the currently enabled color swatch as a global color.\n\nHow to Find and Replace Colors\n\nOnce your global palette is set, Divi users can find any instance of a global color and replace it across the page. This saves time and allows you to test out different color options for your website. To find a color to be replaced, you can use Divi’s handy find and replace tool.\n\nFor example, you can change the background color of your buttons in a section. To enable find and replace, right click on the background color option and click find and replace.\n\nA dialog box will appear allowing you to find the background color, and allow you to select either a saved, global, or recent color. Under within, select whether you’d like to replace the color in the section, row, column, or element settings. For this example, we’ll choose all button settings. Next, choose whether you’d like to change the color throughout the section, row, or column. We’ll choose this section. Next, click the global tab and select a color. Finally, tick the replace all box, then click replace.\n\nHow to Edit Saved and Global Colors\n\nDuring the design process, there may be instances where you want to change saved or global colors. Editing colors is a simple process. To edit a saved color, navigate to Divi > Theme Options > Color Pickers Default Palette. Click on the color to edit the hex code. Finally, click save changes.\n\nWe’d like to note that you can edit the saved color at the module level, but this will not change the saved color globally.\n\nTo edit a global color, simply click into the background options for any element with color options. Click on the global tab, then select the color you’d like to change. Once the color is active, click the eyedropper to edit the color’s settings. Enter a new hex code or click within the Divi color picker, then click the check mark to save it.\n\nA popup will appear asking you to confirm your changes. It should be noted that once you change a global color, it will change all instances of the color across your entire website. Click yes to proceed.\n\nHow to Add Global Colors to Gradients\n\nAnother great feature of using global colors in Divi is the ability to assign them to background gradients. To apply global colors to gradient color stops, simply click the background options, then background gradient. Click the + to add a gradient.\n\nNext, click on the first color stop to add a global color. Click the global tab to select your color.\n\nTo set the second color in the gradient, click the second color stop. Select the color for the stop.\n\nFrom there, you can set the gradient type, direction, and other options for your gradient. To learn more about gradient options, view our documentation on background options in Divi.\n\nHow to Rebrand a Premade Layout With the Divi Color Management System\n\nAs previously mentioned, the Divi Color Management System can be used to edit colors on Divi layout packs. Users can update colors to reflect a new global palette of their choosing. Let’s walk through the steps of updating the static colors in the Chocolatier Divi layout pack to global colors.\n\nStart off by loading the landing page design from the Chocolatier Divi layout pack into your website, then publish the page.\n\nClick on the button in the header section of the page, then navigate to the design tab. Scroll down to the button background section. With the current color selected, click on the global tab, then click the + icon. Finally, click the green check to save your changes.\n\nNext, you’ll use find & replace to edit all instances of that static color used in your site. Click on any section in your webpage and select an instance of the color. This time, right click and select find & replace.\n\nLeave the find the button text color as is, then select all modules under within. Select this section under throughout, then select your newly created global color under the global tab. Next, tick the replace all box. Finally, click replace to convert all instances of the color to your global one.\n\nTips and Best Practices for Divi Color Management\n\nNow that we’ve explained how Divi’s Color Management System works and how to use it, let’s discuss some best practices to implement when working within it.\n\nCreate Your Saved Color Palette First\n\nWhenever you are creating a new website or redesigning an existing one, it’s useful to know what the standardized building blocks of that site will be. We encourage everyone to begin by creating a style guide using Divi itself.\n\nPerhaps the first (and one of the most important) aspects of this style guide is determining your color palette. Once that color palette is created, be sure to save it as your default palette as we’ve shown you above.\n\nYou can then use these colors when designing the rest of the elements (including elements with color variations) of your style guide. Once these elements are created they too can be saved, to the Divi Library, where you can quickly and easily access them wherever you are working on your site.\n\nConvert Static Colors to Global Colors Where Applicable\n\nWhen using the same color from section to section and page to page, in each instance it’s a good idea to assign the global version of that color to those elements. That way, if for some reason down the road you want to change that color you will only have to do it once instead of every instance where the color is used across your entire website. This is a huge timesaver and one of the best features of the Divi Color Management System.\n\nEmbrace Color Palette Limits (Keep Things Simple)\n\nDivi’s Color Pickers Default Palette uses a maximum of 8 colors. This isn’t done by accident. It’s good design practice to limit the number of colors that are used in any design. This is important to achieve harmony in color combinations, which is the backbone of color theory. Visual balance is essential in any website’s design and is harder to achieve if too many colors are used. After all, you don’t want to overwhelm your site’s visitors. Keep your design simple by choosing 3 colors for your design, then focus on using hues of those colors to achieve a visually stunning color palette.\n\nContinue Learning\n\nFor more information on the Divi Color Management System and how to use it to create stunning designs in your websites, check out a few related posts:\n\nHow to Apply Color Palettes to Your Divi Website\nManage Your Entire Website’s Color Scheme From Inside The Visual Builder\nDivi Feature Sneak Peek: A Powerful New Color Manager"

    "html": "Divi Builder Plugin Documentation\nENTER SEARCH TERM\nDIVI\nEXTRA\nBLOOM\nMONARCH\nDIVI BUILDER\nDEVELOPERS\nBACK TO DIVI BUILDER PLUGIN DOCUMENTATION\nHow To Create A New Project In Divi\n\nDivi separates portfolio items into a separate custom post type called Projects.\n\nDivi makes building a project fun and easy. A ‘Projects’ menu item has been added right inside of your Admin Panel so you can create projects as if you were creating a Post or Page. You also have the option to use the basic project structure, or to use the builder to create truly amazing project layouts.\n\nCreating Your Project\n\nTitle\n\nStart off by defining your project title.\n\nPage Layout\n\nYou can choose from three project page layouts—this can be unique to each project if desired. The three layouts include a left sidebar, a right sidebar, or a full width option.\n\nCategories\n\nProject categories are separate from post categories so that you can have full control over what appears inside of your portfolios. Within the Project Builder you can add a new category or choose from existing ones.\n\nTag\n\nUse project tags to define the Skills that were used on the project. These will display on the the project page in a Skills list. Each skill, or tag, can be clicked on to view all projects that include that skill.\n\nFeatured Image\n\nSelect a featured image by choosing/installing an image via the WordPress Media Library. This will be the image that gets displayed as a thumbnail in your portfolio.\n\nThe thumbnail will be based off of the aspect ratio of your featured image, so we recommend that all of your project featured images are the same aspect ratio if you are using a grid layout.\n\nContent: Basic\n\nThe basic project layout will place your featured image at the top of the page above any content that you place in the text editor.\n\nIn the example below you can see that we have the title of our project with our project categorie(s) just to the right. Below that our featured image displays full width above the content that we entered. The tags that were defined show up as skills and the post date appears below that.\n\nContent: Extended\n\nIf you want to create extended project posts, you can click the ‘Use page Builder’ button at the top of the Project Builder and you will be presented with the Divi Builder.\n\nNext, click Use Visual Builder to jump into Divi’s Visual Builder mode.\n\nIn this mode, you have just as much creative freedom as you do when making any other page with the Divi Builder. See The Builder Overview.\n\nNOTE: If you choose to use the builder, you are starting from a blank canvas. So all of the elements from the basic project layout is removed (i.e. Title, Categories, Featured Image, Skills, and Date). However, you will still want to fill out this information for your project thumbnails in your portfolios."

    "html": "Divi Theme Documentation\nENTER SEARCH TERM\nDIVI\nEXTRA\nBLOOM\nMONARCH\nDIVI BUILDER\nDEVELOPERS\nBACK TO DIVI THEME DOCUMENTATION\nHow To Create One-Page Websites With Divi\n\nDivi makes it easy to create beautiful one-page websites.\n\nDivi’s Single Page Sidebar Navigation Makes It Easy\n\nWhen you create a new page, you can easily enable Divi’s Single Page navigation option, giving your visitors a visual and clickable representation of their progress on the page. You can also use custom anchor links and Section ID’s to create one-page menus for the complete One-Page package.\n\nVIEW A LIVE DEMO OF THIS FEATURE\n\nEnabling Single Page Navigation\n\nEnabling Single Page Navigation is easy, and it can be done on a per-page basis. Whenever you create or edit a page, look for the “Divi Settings” box to the right of your text editor. Within this box you will see the Dot Navigation option. Select “On” from the dropdown menu, and then save the page. You will now notice that a floating navigation bar has been added to the right side of your page. The Dot Navigation bar automatically adds a clickable link to each section on your page. When you add a new section, a new circle link (or dot) will be added automatically to your floating side nav. Users can click the dots to skip to different sections on the page. It also makes it easier to identify where the visitor is on the page, making long-format pages easier to understand and navigate.\n\nCreate Custom Menu Links For One-Page Websites\n\nIn addition to side navigation, it’s also possible to transform your main header navigation into one-page navigation. If you are creating a one-page website, then you don’t want your menu links to point to separate pages. Instead, these links can point to relevant sections on the same page. When clicked, they can take you to the relevant section on the page using a smooth scrolling effect. This can be accomplished using custom ID’s. Any element on the page that is built with the builder can be assigned an ID. You can assign an ID to a section by clicking on the section settings icon, and looking for the “CSS ID” setting. Once an ID has been assigned, you can then link to it from the navigation menu. For example, let’s say you have a section called “About Us” and you want it to link to the part of your page that describes your company. Edit the section that contains your About Us content, and enter “aboutus” into the “CSS ID” field and click “Save.” Now that an ID has been assigned, we can point a link to it.\n\nPointing A Menu Link To An ID\n\nTo create a custom menu link, you will need to add a new link to your menu using the “Appearances > Menus” tab in your WordPress Dashboard. If you are unfamiliar with the Menus system, check out this great tutorial. Once you have created a new menu and assigned it to the Main Navigation location, you can start adding links to your header. In this case, we will be creating a custom link by clicking the “Link” tab on the left hand side of the page. Once clicked, you will be given two fields (URL and Link Text). For the “Link Text,” simply enter the text that you would like to show up in your menu (For example, “About Us”). For the URL, we need to link to the ID that we assigned to our section earlier. In this case, we added the id “aboutus” but you can add any ID name that you like. Since we used the ID “aboutus,” we can link to that ID by creating a URL pointing to “/#aboutus”. You can use this same method to create as many custom links as you want. Simply enter a URL of “/#” followed by the ID that you want to target."

    "html": "Divi Builder Plugin Documentation\nENTER SEARCH TERM\nDIVI\nEXTRA\nBLOOM\nMONARCH\nDIVI BUILDER\nDEVELOPERS\nBACK TO DIVI BUILDER PLUGIN DOCUMENTATION\nHow To Use Divi Leads\n\nSplit test your pages, gain valuable stats & insights and increase conversion rates.\n\nWhat Is Divi Leads?\n\nDivi Leads is an incredibly useful Split Testing and Conversion Optimization system backed by powerful stats and insights that helps you unlock your website’s hidden potential. Through simple testing, you can make meaningful design decisions that help boost user engagement and sales. Split Testing is something that everyone should be doing!\n\nWhat’s Split Testing All About?\n\nThe idea behind split testing is simple: You make a change on your page (such as changing text content, size, color, or positioning) and then test that change against the original version to see which variation produces the best results. Let’s consider a classic sales page. At the top we have our sales pitch in the form of a headline (using the Fullwidth Header Module), followed by a list of customer testimonials (using the Testimonials Module), followed by a sales button (using the Call To Action Module). The Goal of the page is to get as many people to click your sales button and buy your product as possible. But how do you know if your sales page is truly effective? How might different value propositions in the headline affect bounce rate? How might different testimonials affect a visitor’s willingness to buy? How might your sales button’s size, color and position on the page affect a visitor’s propensity to click? Each of these items can be turned into a split testing subject to find out exactly how they affect the conversion rate to our desired goal.\n\nSplit tests consist of two main elements: The Subject, and the Goal. The subject is the item that you are testing, and the goal is how you attribute success on your page. In the example above, we could use the Fullwidth Header Module as our test Subject and the Button Module as our Goal. Next you can configure different variations of your headline to figure out how each versions affects relevant user engagement statistics. A more effective headline will lead to higher user engagement, lower bounce rate, and these engaged users will ultimate click your sales button more often. Since we have selected the Call To Action Module as our Goal, Divi Leads will track clicks on the CTA button (in addition to other basic stats). Each version of your test subject will be shown to different visitors and over time a differences in conversion rates will become apparent. Using these stats, you can make an informed decision as to which headline is most successful. This test will show us how different versions of our header affect click-through rates to our button, and we can make an informed decision as to which version is superior.Similar split tests can be performed for each item on your page, increasing the overall conversion rate of your page by leaps and bounds!\n\nStarting Your First Test\n\nTo begin a split test, open the Divi Builder Page Settings and turn on the Split Testing feature. After clicking “Save,” you will be prompted to configure your test. During this process you will be asked to do two things: 1) Choose your split testing subject, and 2) Choose your split testing goal. The subject is the item that you would like to test. This item will be duplicated so that you can configure different variations, each of which will be shown to different visitors. The goal is what you want your visitors to do on your page. Depending on the goal you choose, Divi Leads will track relevant stats. For example, if you are testing a landing page and your goal is to gain leads using the Email Optin Module, then you can select the Email Optin Module on your page as your goal. Divi Leads will then track how each of your subject variations affects email optin conversion rates. If the goal of your page is to sell items through your WooCommerce store, then you can select the eCommerce Module as your goal. In this case, Divi Leads will track sales. If you have a simple page with a standard call to action button that you would like users to click, then you can assign the relevant Call To Action or Button module as your goal and Divi Leads will track click-through rates. Any module, row or section can be assigned as a goal. You can even assign your test subject as the goal.\n\nPicking Your Test Subject\n\nThe first things Divi Leads will ask you to do is pick your test subject.Anything on your page can be tested. In Divi, your test subject can be any Module, Row or Section. Once your test subject has been chosen and your split test has begun, your test subject will be duplicated and you can begin configuring the alternate variation. In doing so, you can make and test any number of changes, including different content, design and positioning. You can make any number of variations by simply duplicating the test subject. For example, you could test 10 different headlines at once by testing your fullwidth header module, duplicating the test subject and configuring all 10 variations.Select your split testing subject by clicking on it with your mouse.\n\nSelecting Your Goal\n\nNext up, Divi Leads will ask you to select your goal.Anything on your page can be used as a goal. In Divi, your goal can be any Module, Row or Section. Depending on the item you choose as your goal, Divi Leads will track relevant user engagement statistics. Over time, you will be able to see how each version of your test subject affects the conversion rate to your specified goal. For example, if you have chosen your Fullwidth Header as your test subject and your Call To Action module as your goal, Divi Leads will display different version of your Fullwidth Header to different visitors and track how often each of those visitors clicks your Call To Action module. Over time, it may become apparent that one version of your Fullwidth Header increases click-through rates. Select your goal by clicking on it with your mouse\n\nViewing Test Results\n\nOnce you have configured your split test, you will need to wait for traffic stats to be collected. Divi Leads will show each variation of your test subject to different visitors and collect insights for each. You can view your current test results by clicking on the stats icon at the top of the Divi Builder.\n\nDepending on the goal you choose, Divi Leads will track different stats:\n\nClicks\n\nThis shows you how often your goal has been clicked. Clickthrough rate is calculated by: Clicks / Impressions.\n\nSales\n\nThis shows you how often a WooCommerce product has been purchased. Sales rate is calculated by Sales / Impressions.\n\nConversions\n\nThis shows you how often a form has been submitted (such as a Contact Form or Email Optin Form). Conversion rate is calculated by Conversions / Impression.\n\nBounce Rate\n\nThis shows you how often visitors stay on your page, and how often they bounce. A visitor is considered to have “bounced” when they land on your page and then leave right away without consuming any of your content. Bounce rate is calculated by Bounces / Impressions. Lower bounce rates are superior to high bounce rates.\n\nReads\n\nThis shows you how often visitors read your goal. For example if you set a Text Module at the bottom of your page as your goal, the reading rate will tell you how many visitors actually scrolled down your page and read that text module. Reading rate is calculated by Reads / Impressions.\n\nGoal Engagement\n\nThis stat is a little different, as it does not take into consideration the test subject at all. The sole purpose of this stat is to determine how effect your Goal is, independent of all other factors. Engagement rate is calculated by Goal Reads / Goal Impressions. For example, a successful test subject may by thwarted by a Goal that is entirely unappealing and ignored.\n\nEnding A Split Test\n\nOnce your test has gathered enough statistics and you have decided which variation of your test subject is most effective, you can end the test and pick the version that you would like to keep.To end a test, simply right click on the test subject and choose “End Split Test,” or disable Split Testing inside the Divi Builder Page Settings.Once your have chosen to end your test, Divi Leads will prompt you to select the winner of the test. Simply click on the test subject that you would like to keep with your mouse. Divi Leads will delete the remaining test subjects and the test will be completed.\n\nAdditional Options\n\nOnce Split Testing has been enabled for the current page, a few conditional options will appear inside the Divi Builder Page Settings popup. These settings are:\n\nBounce Rate Limit\n\nThis rate affects what is/isn’t considered a bounced visitor. Bounced visitors determine the page’s bounce rate, which is a great metric for determining overall visitor engagement levels. When a visitor lands on your page and leaves right away, that visitor is considered a “bounce” and your bounce rate increass. The lower your bounce rate, the better. The bounce rate limit determines what is considered to be a bounced visitor. By default, any visitor who lands on your page and leaves within 5 seconds is considered a bounce. However, you can change this value using the Bounce Rate Limit setting.\n\nStats Refresh Interval\n\nWhen a split testing is running, Divi Leads tracks relevant user engagement stats to be displayed in the statistics window. By default, these stats update once per hour and are cached in the WP database. However, if you would like to reduce the server resource used by Divi Leads then you can reduce this frequency to once per day.\n\nShortcode Tracking\n\nShortcode tracking is used to track off-page goals. Place the Divi Leads shortcode tracker on any page on your website and Divi Leads will track visits to that page as a separate conversion metric. For more details, please continue reading.\n\nShortcode Tracking For Off-Page Goals\n\nShortcode tracking can be used to track off-page goals. These are goals that exist outside the current page being tested.For example, let’s say you are testing your software company’s lead generation page. You have created a new test with a Fullwidth Header Module as your subject and an Email Optin Module as your goal. The goal of this page is to collect emails to be imported into your CRM system. Once imported into the CRM system, an email marketing automation campaign is launched, the goal of which is to encourage the person to purchase your software product through a separate page. After the sale is completed, customers are referred to a Thank You/Confirmation page on your website.This series of events is what is known as a “sales funnel.” In this case, the initial split test is focused on on-page metrics for the first page in our funnel. Using the shortocde tracker, however, you can also track how many people complete the entire sales funnel and ultimately purchase your product. Simply copy and past the tracking shortcode into the page content of the final Thank You page, and Divi will track that metric.Using this same logic, the shortcode tracker can be used to track any number of things. It can be used to track sales in third party ecommerce plugins, leads generated by third party opt-in system, or anything else for that matter!"

    "html": "Divi Theme Documentation\nENTER SEARCH TERM\nDIVI\nEXTRA\nBLOOM\nMONARCH\nDIVI BUILDER\nDEVELOPERS\nBACK TO DIVI THEME DOCUMENTATION\nHow To Use Divi Blog Post Formats\n\nDivi comes with post format support for video, audio, links and quotes.\n\nCustomizing the design of blog posts is a great way to make your content and web page stand out. The recommended way to do this within Divi is by creating a blog post template in the Theme Builder and assigning that template to all posts. However, there is another way to customize blog post formats if you’d like to use Gutenberg.\n\nWhen you customize a blog post format with Gutenberg, please note that you won’t be able to style these blog post formats with Divi or assign a Theme Builder template to them. To customize blog post formats within Gutenberg you’ll need to have purchased a child theme that comes with styled post formats, create your own, or style them with custom CSS in Divi’s general settings.\n\nIn this doc, we’ll go over the 6 post format types that Divi supports and how to use them.\n\nDivi Supports Six Post Formats\n\nPost format is an optional value that can be assigned to WordPress blog posts that allow developers to design specific templates for each post format. Not all themes or plugins support custom post formats and it’s not required for theme developers to support all post formats. That’s why we recommend creating a blog post template in the Divi Theme Builder. However, Divi does come with post format support for standard, video, audio, links, gallery, and quotes. Each of these formats structures your post differently, putting more focus on the type of content that the format represents.\n\nHow to Select a Post Format\n\nTo select a post format, first, add a new post then click “Use Default Editor”.\n\nOnce the post loads with the default editor, you’ll see an option appear in the sidebar that says “Post Format”. Click the dropdown menu to select your post type.\n\nUsing the Standard Post Format\n\nStandard is the default post format in WordPress. You can use this post format for articles, blog posts, case studies, etc. Standard posts can also include other content types like links, images, galleries, and quotes.\n\nUsing the Video Post Format\n\nWhen selecting the Video post format, the first video link in the post will be placed as a video at the top of your post. It also replaces the default post thumbnail with a video embed.\n\nAfter selecting the Video post format, you’ll need to copy and paste a video link from YouTube or Vimeo into the blog post or upload a video directly to your website via the WordPress media library. This will automatically position the first video link used in your post as the format video and feature it at the top of the post.\n\nUsing the Audio Post Format\n\nSelecting the Audio post format will display an audio player on your post. It will also replace the standard Thumbnail image on index pages with your audio player. The audio player will play the first audio file that you embed into your post. To add an audio file to your post, use the “Add Media” button to upload your audio file. Once you upload a file, the theme will automatically use it for the post you are currently editing. The audio file must be uploaded while editing the post.\n\nUsing the Quote Post Format\n\nThe Quote post format displays a stylized blockquote at the top of your post that is pulled from the first blockquote you have in the blog post. The stylized blockquote will also replace the standard thumbnail image on all index pages. To make a piece of text a quote, simply highlight the text and press the blockquote button to turn it into a quote.\n\nUsing the Gallery Post Format\n\nThe Gallery post format displays a gallery of images at the top of your post. It will also replace the standard Thumbnail image on all index pages with an image gallery slider. Once selected, the Gallery post format will use the first gallery that you added to your post.\n\nTo add a gallery to your blog post, click the black plus button on a new line to bring up the Gutenberg content blocks library and select “gallery”. Click the “upload” button to upload new photos or click “Media Library” to choose photos from your media library.\n\nUsing the Link Post Format\n\nThe Link post format displays a stylized link at the top of the post. Once selected, the link post format will use the first link in your post as the main URL link. This is the link that will be displayed at the top of the post and it will also replace the standard Thumbnail image on all index pages.  To add a link to your post, you can use the “link” button in the WordPress post editor.\n\nStyle Divi’s Post Formats\n\nThere are three main ways to style post formats.\n\nCode Custom Post Types\n\nTo edit the design of the default blog post formats, or to create new ones, you’ll need to know a little code and have a child theme installed.\n\nTo learn how to customize post formats with code, check out these resources:\n\nHow To Create WordPress Post Formats\nHow to Add Custom Templates and Design to Divi’s Blog Post Formats (Part 1 of 3)\nHow to Add Custom Templates and Design to Divi’s Blog Post Formats (Part 2 of 3)\nHow to Add Custom Templates and Design to Divi’s Blog Post Formats (Part 3 of 3)\nPurchase a Child Theme\n\nAlternatively, you could purchase a Divi child theme that comes with pre-designed post formats.\n\nStyle Post Formats With CSS\n\nAnother way to style blog post formats is to use custom CSS. You’ll need to know your way around the console and have knowledge of basic CSS but there are plenty of ways to target certain elements by using the inspection tool. To learn how to do this, check out this blog post.\n\nMore Resources\nCreating Stunning Event Custom Post Type Templates with Divi\nHow To Create WordPress Post Formats\nHow to Add Custom Templates and Design to Divi’s Blog Post Formats (Part 1 of 3)\nHow to Add Custom Templates and Design to Divi’s Blog Post Formats (Part 2 of 3)\nHow to Add Custom Templates and Design to Divi’s Blog Post Formats (Part 3 of 3)"

This will launch the customizer. Next look for the “General Settings” panel. Click the panel to open up the relevant settings and begin customizing. Within the General Settings panel you will notice three sections: Layout Settings, Typography and Background.\n\nLayout Settings\n\nThe layouts panel is where you can adjust various sizing and spacing options for your website. Here you can increase or reduce spacing between columns, rows and sections, and adjust the size of your sidebar. You can also enable “Boxed Layout” mode from within this panel.\n\nENABLE BOXED LAYOUT\n\nHere you can change your site into a box layout which frames the content of your site and exposes a background that can be customized.\n\nWEBSITE CONTENT WIDTH\n\nThis is where you can set the max width of your content section. Since your content is on a responsive layout, it will adjust to smaller sizes but will not expand any wider than the max width set here.\nThe default is set to 1080px. This is a good width for most standard laptops and desktops.\n\nWEBSITE GUTTER WIDTH\n\nGutter width corresponds to the amount of horizontal space (margin) between the columns in each row.\n\nOptional values for gutter width range from 1 to 4.\n\n1 represents zero margin between columns.\n2 represents a 3% right margin between columns.\n3 represents a 5.5% right margin between columns.\n4 represents a 8% right margin between columns.\n\nUSE CUSTOM SIDEBAR WIDTH\n\nThis sets the default sidebar width for your theme. This applies to all pages on your theme that have a sidebar and are not built using the Divi Builder.\n\nSECTION AND ROW HEIGHT\n\nThese options adjust the amount of vertical spacing (top and bottom padding) for each section and row.\n\nTHEME ACCENT COLOR\n\nBefore you start changing the colors for your other elements, you should change this first. Once you change it, save & publish your settings and refresh your page. Now the updated Theme Accent Color should have populated other elements automatically.\n\nTypography\n\nThe typography panel is where you can adjust the default appearance of the text across your entire website. You can adjust the size of your body font and header fonts, which will be reflected across all areas of the site proportionally. You can adjust their colors as well as line height, letter spacing and font styles. Finally, you can also choose between dozens of fonts to be applied to each.\n\nBODY TEXT SIZE\n\nThis changes the default body text for your theme. The default size is 14px.\n\nBODY LINE HEIGHT\n\nThe line height of each individual line of text.\n\nHEADER TEXT SIZE\n\nDivi allows you to set your default Header text size here. This effects elements of Divi like the Fullwidth Header Module titles.\n\nHEADER LETTER SPACING\n\nLetter spacing adjusts the horizontal space between letters. The Header Letter Spacing value affects all of the header levels (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6), blockquotes, and slide titles.\n\nHEADER LINE HEIGHT\n\nJust like for the letter spacing value, the header line height value affects all of the header levels (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6), blockquotes, and slide titles. Because of the larger font size, 1em is the default settings.\n\nHEADER FONT STYLE\n\nUse these options to change the font style of your headers.\n\nHEADER AND BODY FONT\n\nThe default font in Divi is Open Sans , but the Divi Theme Customizer has almost a hundred fonts to choose from! Take advantage of these built-in fonts and test which ones work best for your theme.\n\nBODY LINK COLOR\n\nThe body link color is inherited by your theme accent color. But you can always change it here.\n\nBODY TEXT COLOR\n\nHere you can change the color of your body text.\n\nHEADER TEXT COLOR\n\nHere you can change the color of your headers.\n\nBackground\n\nThe background panel allows you to adjust the background color of your theme, as well as upload a custom background image and adjust its positioning on the page.

This panel allows you to customize that menu bar and the text within it, adjusting the background color, text color and text styles.\n\nFixed Navigation\n\nThe fixed navigation bar refers to the navigation bar as it becomes fixed to the top of your screen when you scroll. You will notice that as you scroll down your page, your menu bar remains fixed to the top of the screen and shrinks to provide more readable space on the screen. All of this is customizable from within the Fixed Navigation panel. You can adjust the height of the menu if you think it shrinks too small, and you can adjust the colors of the menu and the menu links independently from the menu’s non-fixed state.\n\n\nHeader Elements\n\nHeader elements are various optional things that appear in your navigation bar, each of which can be toggled on and off here, such as your social follow icons, the search icon, phone number and email address."

If there is something bothering you about the appearance of a particular module, and you would like to adjust the appearance of that module on your entire site, The Module Customizer is you new best friend. The access the Module Customizer, click the Divi > Module Customizer link in your WordPress Dashboard. When you open the customizer, you will notice individual panels for each of the Divi Modules. To adjust the appearance of a module, open the panel to reveal the available settings.\n\nUsing The Customizer Controls\n\nMost of the module customizer controls are limited to font sizes, style and custom spacing. For additional control, you can use the module’s Design Settings. For small adjustments, however, the Module Customizer is perfect. When you adjust the appearance of a module within the Module Customizer, it will affect all of the modules of that type on your website, which can save you precious time when configuring new modules for each page.\n\nIf, for example, you find that the Fullwidth Slider module is too large for your taste, and you would like all of your sliders to be a little smaller, you can adjust the size of the module’s padding using the Module Customizer. Open the Fullwidth Slider panel within the Module Customizer and use the slider controls for “padding” to decreased the overall size of the slider. If there is a slider active on the page you are viewing, you will get a live preview of your adjustments."

You can add a single global module to multiple pages. If you change the global module on one page, it gets updated instantly on all of the other pages it has been added to as well. A simple use-case for this would be a Call To Action Module that appears at the bottom of many or all of the pages on your website. If a single module is repeated on multiple pages, it’s very useful to make this module Global. This way, you don’t have to edit every single page when you want to make a change to it.Global elements open up so many possibilities, especially when you consider that you can selectively sync individual settings for each module. For example, you could create a global Header Module that appears at the top of all of your pages, and choose to only sync certain options in the Design and Advanced Tabs. This will allow you to apply custom styling to the entire series of pages using this global header module, but still allow you to add unique title text content to each module within the modules “Content” tab (which has not been synced). If you ever want to adjust the look and feel of these global header modules, you only have to edit the options you chose to be synced once. Entire sections can also be made into global sections. This is a perfect way to create a custom footer for your entire site, and have that footer section mirrored across all of your pages. If you ever want to change your global footer section, you only have to edit it once and the changes get applied everywhere the section has been used.\n\nCreating A New Global Library Item\n\nMaking a library item global is simple. When saving your library item, check the “Save As Global” option. Any item that is saved with this option selected becomes a global item.\n\nGlobal items within the page builder are easily identified by their green color. If you are editing a module, row or section that is green, or if the current modal settings window that you have open is green, then you know that you are currently editing a global item. It’s important to know when a global item is being edited, because any change you make will be mirrored across every page that item has been placed on.\n\nGlobal Modules & Selective Sync\n\nAs mentioned previously, you can selective sync any of the module settings options when saving a global library item. For example, if you create a new global module and choose to only sync the “Background Color” option, then only the “Background Color” for that module will be mirrored. What does this mean exactly and why is it useful?\n\nLet’s say you have a Fullwidth Header module at the top of all of your pages. This is quite common. Each header module has a different title in the “Content” tab to represent the current page. You have also edited the options in the “Design” tab to give your header a unique look by adjusting the title font color to blue, title font style to Bold & All Caps, and title font size to 40px. You want all of you header modules on each page to use this unique style, but you need each page to have unique titles. In this case, you can create a Global Fullwidth Header module and choose to selectively sync only those options (font color, font style, and font size).\n\nNow whenever you add this global module to a new page, these options will be synced, but all of your other options will remain unique for the current module.\n\nIf you ever want to change the style of the headers on all your pages, you can modify the synced options for the header text style shared by these global modules and the changes will be reflected on every single page that global header has been used! Wow, that saves you an incredible amount of time.\n\nThis same theory could be applied to the options in the “Advanced” tab as well. Let’s say that you have created a Slider Module and applied a unique animation to the slider’s button. You want to use this new unique animation on all of the Slider Modules on your website. In this case, you can create a new Global Slider Module and selectively sync the Custom CSS for the Slide Button (which includes your custom CSS animation).\n\nAdd this slider to your page and you can adjust all of the other options freely, while keeping your unique Custom CSS option synced across the entire series of modules. If you ever want to adjust the Custom CSS option for this series of global modules, you only have to do it once. Editing the Custom CSS option in one module updates for all implementations of this Global Slider Module.\n\nWhenever you edit a global module, you can easily identify which options are currently being synced by the green sync icon located on the left of each option. Options that have the green sync icon are options that are currently being synced within the global module. Options edited with green sync icons are shared by all instances of the global item. To un-sync an option, simply click the green sync icon and you will see the icon turn red. Options that have the red sync icon are NOT currently being synced within the global module."

Everything inside of Divi can be exported from one website and then imported into a new website. Divi exports are also a great way to back up parts of your website, save your favorite presets for new client builds, or share your custom Divi layouts and settings with your peers. This includes Theme Options, Theme Customizer Settings, Divi Roles, and most importantly Divi Layout and Divi Library collections. Each system works exactly the same and you will notice the Divi portability icon throughout the theme. When you export a Divi Layout or Divi Library item, it can then be shared and used on any Divi website. Everything, including images, custom CSS and Advanced Design Settings are contained in a single JSON file. When you import the file to a new website, your uploaded Divi Layouts will be ready to use!\n\nExporting Divi Library Items\n\nThe Divi Library is a powerful tool for web designers, as it allows you to build and categorize custom designs that you can use to jump-start your future projects. Using the portability system, these custom designs can now be easily transfered between websites and shared with your peers. To export Divi Library items, you will first need to navigate to the Divi > Divi Library page in your WordPress Dashboard. Here you will see a list of all of your Divi Library items, along with an “Import & Export” button at the top of the screen. Clicking this button will launch the portability popup.\n\nFrom within this popup, while inside the “Export” tab, you can click the “Export Divi Builder Layouts” button to begin exporting your entire Divi Library. You can also choose a name for your export file. Exporting large library collections, especially those that contain high resolution photos, can take some time. It’s recommend to export your library into moderately-sized collections.\n\nIf you have a very large library, you may want to pick and choose individual items to export instead of exporting everything at once. Divi allows you to select individual items to export. To do this, close the portability popup and, within your list of library items, select the items that you would like to export.\n\nClick the “Import & Export” once again to launch the portability popup. Before exporting, select the “Only export selected items” check box. Now Divi will only export the items that you have previously selected from your Divi Library.\n\nAfter the export process has completed, your browser will automatically download a .JSON file. This file can be used to import your exported items onto a new website using the “Import” tab inside the portability popup.\n\nImporting Divi Library Items\n\nOnce you have exported a Divi Library collection, you can import it onto a new website. You will be using the same portability popup to do this. First things first, navigate to your Divi > Divi Library page and then click the “Import & Export” button. This time you will need to click the “Import” tab to reveal the import options.\n\nOnce inside the Import tab, click the “Choose File” button and locate the .JSON file that you previously exported. Once you have selected the file, click the “Import Divi Builder Layouts” button to begin importing. Once the import process has completed, you will notice that the Divi Library items have been added to your library and included images have been imported into your WordPress Media Library.\n\nExporting Individual Divi Layouts\n\nIndividual Divi Builder Layouts can also be exported. The process works exactly the same as exporting library items, the only difference is that individual items can be exported and imported directly from and onto the post you are currently editing within the Divi Builder.When using the Divi Builder, look for the Divi portability icon. Clicking this icon will launch the portability system, and you can export your current Divi Layout.\n\nImporting Individual Divi Layouts\n\nOnce you have exported your Divi Layout and downloaded the .JSON file, this file can be imported onto a new page. Imported layouts will replace your current page content with the exported content. To import a Divi Builder Layout, click the portability icon within the Divi Builder to launch the portability system. Navigate to the Import tab. Click the “Choose File” button and locate your previously-exported Divi Builder layout and click the “Import Divi Builder Layouts button.””\n\nImporting and Exporting Divi Roles Settings\n\nIf you would like to export the Role Settings for your site, first navigate to the Divi > Role Editor page in your WordPress Dashboard. Once you have saved your role settings how you want them, click the portability icon above the Role Settings. This will launch the portability system where you can export your current Role settings. Alternatively, if you have a previously-exported Role Settings .JSON file, you can choose to import those settings here.\n\nThe ability to import and export Divi Role Settings comes in handy when you have certain settings that you want to duplicate for other websites. With a few clicks, you can have your role settings in place.\n\nImporting and Exporting Divi Theme Options\n\nIf you would like to export Divi Theme Options, first navigate to the Divi > Theme Options page in your WordPress Dashboard. Once you have saved your Theme Options how you want them, click the portability icon. This will launch the portability system where you can export your current Divi Theme Options. Alternatively, if you have a previously-exported Theme Options .JSON file, you can choose to import those options here.\n\nImporting and Exporting Divi Theme Customizer Settings\n\nImporting and exporting Divi Theme Customizer Settings is an easy way to jumpstart your next project. Getting the theme customizer settings just right can take time. Why not export these settings to speed up your next project?\n\nIf you would like to export Divi Theme Customizer Settings, first navigate to the Divi > Theme Customizer page in your WordPress Dashboard. Once you have saved your Divi Theme Customizer Settings how you want them, click the portability icon at the top of the customizer. This will launch the portability system where you can export your current Divi Theme Options.

    "html": "Divi Builder Plugin Documentation\nENTER SEARCH TERM\nDIVI\nEXTRA\nBLOOM\nMONARCH\nDIVI BUILDER\nDEVELOPERS\nBACK TO DIVI BUILDER PLUGIN DOCUMENTATION\nAn Overview Of Divi Sections\n\nSections are the builder’s largest building blocks, and can be used in various ways.\n\nSections are the biggest building block in the Divi builder. You can think of them as horizontal stacking blocks that can group your content into visually distinguishable areas. In Divi, everything you build starts with a section. This content wrapper has various settings that can be used to do some really awesome things.\n\nHow To Add A Section To Your Page\n\nBefore you can add a section module to your page, you will first need to jump into the Divi Builder. Once the Divi Theme has been installed on your website, you will notice a Use Divi Builder button above the post editor every time you are building a new page. Clicking this button will enable the Divi Builder, giving you access to all of the Divi Builder’s modules. Next, click the Use Visual Builder button to launch the builder in Visual Mode. You can also click the Use Visual Builder button when browsing your website on the front end if you are logged in to your WordPress Dashboard.\n\nOnce you have entered the Visual Builder, you can click the blue plus button to add a new section to your page. You will be greeted with a popup that allows you to add any of Divi’s three section types. These types include: Standard, Specialty and Fullwidth.\n\nOnce the section has been added, you will be greeted with the section’s list of options. These options are separated into three main groups: Content, Design and Advanced.\n\nSection Content Options\n\nWithin the content tab you will find all of the section’s content elements. For sections, these content elements are limited to background elements such as background images and videos.\n\nBackground Image\n\nIf defined, this image will be used as the background for this module. To remove a background image, simply delete the URL from the settings field.\n\nBackground Color\n\nIf defined, this image will be used as the background for this module. To remove a background image, simply delete the URL from the settings field.\n\nBackground Video MP4\n\nAll videos should be uploaded in both .MP4 .WEBM formats to ensure maximum compatibility in all browsers. Upload the .MP4 version here. Video backgrounds are disabled from mobile devices. Instead, your background image will be used. For this reason, you should define both a background image and a background video to ensure best results. Important Note: In order for the MP4 video format to work in all browsers, your server must have the correct MIME types designated. You can learn more about using .htaccess to define MIME types here. If you notice your videos are not playing in certain browsers, then this is likely the reason.\n\nBackground Video WEBM\n\nAll videos should be uploaded in both .MP4 .WEBM formats to ensure maximum compatibility in all browsers. Upload the .WEBM version here. Video backgrounds are disabled from mobile devices. Instead, your background image will be used. For this reason, you should define both a background image and a background video to ensure best results. Important Note: In order for the WEBM video format to work in all browsers, your server must have the correct MIME types designated. You can learn more about using .htaccess to define MIME types here. If you notice your videos are not playing in certain browsers, then this is likely the reason.\n\nBackground Video Width\n\nIn order for videos to be sized correctly, you must input the exact width (in pixels) of your video here.\n\nBackground Video Height\n\nIn order for videos to be sized correctly, you must input the exact height (in pixels) of your video here.\n\nAdmin Label\n\nIn this dropdown you can add an admin label that will appear in the back end builder as well as the visual builder’s skeleton view.\n\nSection Design Options\n\nWithin the design tab you will find all of the section’s styling options, such as sizing and spacing. This is the tab you will use to change how your section looks. Every Divi section type has a long list of design settings that you can use to change just about anything.\n\nShow Inner Shadow\n\nHere you can select whether or not your section has an inner shadow. This can look great when you have colored backgrounds or background images.\n\nUse Parallax Effect\n\nIf enabled, your background image will stay fixed as your scroll, creating a fun parallax-like effect. You can also choose between two parallax methods: CSS and True Parallax.\n\nCustom Padding\n\nHere you can adjust the padding of the section to specific values, or leave blank to use the default padding.\n\nSection Advanced Options\n\nWithin the advanced tab, you will find options that more experienced web designers might find useful, such as custom CSS and HTML attributes. Here you can apply custom CSS to your section. You can also apply custom CSS classes and IDs to the section, which can be used to customize the section within your child theme’s style.css file.\n\nCSS ID\n\nEnter an optional CSS ID to be used for this section. An ID can be used to create custom CSS styling, or to create links to particular sections of your page.\n\nCSS Class\n\nEnter optional CSS classes to be used for this section. A CSS class can be used to create custom CSS styling. You can add multiple classes, separated with a space. These classes can be used in your Divi Child Theme or within the Custom CSS that you add to your page or your website using the Divi Theme Options or Divi Builder Page Settings.\n\nCustom CSS\n\nCustom CSS can be applied to the section here. Within the Custom CSS section, you will find a text field where you can add custom CSS directly to each element. CSS input into these settings are already wrapped within style tags, so you need only enter CSS rules separated by semicolons.\n\nVisibility\n\nThis option lets you control which devices your section appears on. You can choose to disable your section on tablets, smart phones or desktop computers individually. This is useful if you want to use different sections on different devices, or if you want to simplify the mobile design by eliminating certain sections from the page.\n\nUsing Fullwidth Sections\n\nFullwidth sections give you access to a new set of Fullwidth Modules. These modules act a little differently because they take advantage of the full width of the browser. Fullwidth modules can only be placed within Fullwidth sections.\n\nOnce you add a new fullwidth section to your page, you can click the “Add Modules” button within the section to add a fullwidth module. Unlike normal section, there is no concept of rows or columns, since the fullwidth modules always takes advantage of 100% of the screen. Fullwidth modules are a great way to add a visual break to the page!\n\nA great example of a fullwidth module is the fullwidth slider. This fullwidth slider works just like a normal slider, except that it expands to 100% width. Displaying a slider at such a scale can be quite stunning, just check our the divi demo for an example.\n\nUsing Specialty Sections\n\nSpecialty sections were created to allow for more advanced column structures. Unlike normal sections, when you use a specialty section, you can add complex column variations next to full-spanning vertical sidebars, without adding unwanted breaks to the page. These types of layouts are not possible using normal sections.\n\nOnce you add a specialty section to the page, you will notice that one area has an “add module” button, while the other has an “insert row” button. The “insert module” area represents your vertical sidebar. You can add as many modules here, in a single row, and they will span the vertical width of the section, adjacent to the column structure you build next to it. Clicking “insert row” will allow you to insert additional rows to the left/right of your sidebar. In a way, this can be thought of as adding rows within rows!\n\nThe result is the ability to create just about any column structure that you could dream of, and no matter what structure you choose, we have made sure that the combination will look great! Here is an example of a page layout created using specialty sections. As you can see, the effect is a dual-sidebar layout, with two vertical-spanning rows on the left/right of a complex column structure in the middle."

Everything you need to create awesome Divi Layouts and take full advantage of each module can be found in the Content tab. However, if you want even more control over the appearance of the module then you can venture into the Design tab. If you are a developer and you want to use your own CSS instead of using the design controls in the Design tab, then you can venture further into the Advanced tab. When combined, there is nothing that can’t be customized.\n\nDesign Settings\n\nThe Design settings vary from module to module. For each, we have added all the possible design settings that you could ever want into the Design tab. Due to the sheer breadth of design settings available for certain modules, we have separated them into labeled dropdowns that toggle each group of design settings. There is also a convenient Search Options box above all options to make finding a specific design option that much easier.\n\nTo locate and use the Design Settings, simply edit an existing module, row or section (or create a new one) to open up the settings popup. Next click on the Design tab to reveal the design options.\n\nFrom within this tab you can do just about anything. Settings will vary depending on the type of module you are editing. Typically you will find options to adjust typography (such as text size, letter spacing, line height, etc), spacing adjustments (such as custom padding and margin values), color options (such as text color, overlay color, column background colors) as well as a slew of unique settings for certain elements. Utilizing these design options can create some truly unique.\n\nAdvanced Settings\n\nIn the Design tab, we have created so many options that you can do just about anything that can be done with CSS (without touching a line of code). If you are a developer, however, you might prefer to write your own code instead of using our custom design controls. In this case you can use the Advanced tab, which can be found right next to the Design tab in the modal settings window for modules, rows and sections.\n\nIn this tab you can add a custom CSS ID or CSS Class in order to target and apply your own CSS from your child theme’s style.css file.\n\nIf you want to remove the need and the hassle of creating Child Themes, you can easily target CSS to individual modules on individual pages by utilizing the options in the Custom CSS dropdown. Here we have broken down all of the structural elements of the module, and given you text area fields where you can type in your own CSS. Using this panel you can apply CSS to individual parts of the module. For example, you could apply custom CSS directly to a Blurb Icon, or create your own :after pseudo element right from the Divi Builder.\n\nAnd finally, in the visibility dropdown, you are able to adjust the visibility of your module on phones, tablets, and desktops."

Much like modules, rows have various settings that can be accessed by clicking the settings icon on the top left of the row. In this tutorial we will be going over just a few of the features and how they can be used to create some very unique layouts. Rows settings in particular can be used to greatly increase the variety of layouts built with the Divi Builder since they create the structure that your modules are housed in.\n\nThe Content Settings\nBackground Color\n\nBackground images can be applied to an entire row. By default, rows have a transparent background color.\n\nBackground Image\n\nBackground images can be applied to the an entire row.\n\nBackground Video MP4\n\nBackground videos can be applied to rows. If you would like to apply a background video, you must upload both an MP4 and WEBM video and input the videos here.\n\nBackground Video Webm\n\nBackground videos can be applied to rows. If you would like to apply a background video, you must upload both an MP4 and WEBM video and input the videos here.\n\nBackground Video Width\n\nAfter your videos have been uploaded, you must input the width of your video here. It must be equal to the actual width of the video, otherwise the background position will be incorrect.\n\nBackground Video Height\n\nAfter your videos have been uploaded, you must input the height of your video here. It must be equal to the actual height of the video, otherwise the background position will be incorrect.\n\nPause Video\n\nIf you would like videos to be paused when clicked, enable this option.\n\nColumn Background Color\n\nFor each column in a row, you can assign a unique background color.\n\nColumn Background Image\n\nFor each column in a row, you can assign a unique background image.\n\nAdmin Label\n\nThis will change the label of the module in the builder for easy identification. When using WireFrame view in the Visual Builder, these labels will appear within the module block in the Divi Builder interface.\n\nThe Design Settings\nUse Parallax Effect\n\nIf you would like to use a parallax affect for your row background image, you can enabled here and then choose your desired parallax method.\n\nColumn Parallax Effect\n\nHere you can choose whether or not to use parallax effect for the background image of a specific column in your row.\n\nMake This Row Fullwidth\n\nIf this option is enabled, the row will extend the full width of the browser window (similar to a full width section). This is a great way to create cool fullwidth column layouts.\n\nUse Custom Width\n\nYou can also assign a custom width to a row. For example if you would like to add some variation to the flow of the page and make a certain row larger than the rest, you can input a custom width value here\n\nUse Custom Gutter Width\n\nGutter width adjusts the distance between columns. There are 4 gutter width sizes, ranging from none to large. Setting the gutter width to 1 will result in no space between columns. When combined with the Fullwidth Row option, this can create effects similar to the FullWidth Portfolio module.\n\nEqualize Column Heights\n\nThis is a great option, especially useful when you have applied background colors to individual columns. Enabling this option will force all columns in the row to have the same height value.\n\nCustom Padding\n\nIf you would like to adjust the padding of the row, you can do so here.\n\nCustom Margin\n\nIf you would like to adjust the margin of the row, you can do so here.\n\nColumn Custom Padding\n\nIf you would like to adjust the padding of a specific column in your row, you can do so here.\n\nColumn Custom Margin\n\nIf you would like to adjust the margin of a specific column in your row, you can do so here.\n\nThe Advanced Settings\nCSS ID\n\nYou can assign an CSS ID to the row if you would like to target it in your stylesheet or with anchor links.\n\nCSS CLASS\n\nYou can assign an CSS Class to the row if you would like to target it in your stylesheet.\n\nColumn CSS ID\n\nYou can assign an CSS ID to a specific column in your row if you would like to target it in your stylesheet or with anchor links.\n\nColumn CSS CLASS\n\nYou can assign an CSS Class to a specific column in your row if you would like to target it in your stylesheet.\n\nBefore\n\nInput CSS here to be applied :before the main row div.\n\nMain Element\n\nInput CSS here to be applied to the main row div.\n\nAfter\n\nInput CSS here to be applied :after the main row div.\n\nColumn Before\n\nInput CSS here to be applied :before the specified column div.\n\nColumn Main Element\n\nInput CSS here to be applied to the specified column div.\n\nColumn After\n\nInput CSS here to be applied :after the specified column div.\n\nVisibility\n\nThis option lets you control which devices your row module appears on. You can choose to disable your module on tablets, smart phones or desktop computers individually. This is useful if you want to use different modules on different devices, or if you want to simplify the mobile design by eliminating certain elements from the page.\n\nLet’s Give Some Settings A Test Drive\n\nNow that we have gone over all of the settings, let’s test out a few in combination to show you what’s possible when each setting is used creatively. In this example I will be touching on the Fullwidth Row setting as an introduction. The option to make a row “Fullwidth” is one of the most versatile options in the set. This will extend the width of the row to the edge of the browser, similar to a Fullwidth Section. Unlike a Fullwidth Section, however, FullWidth Rows can have column structures and they can house any module! In the example below I have created a 4 column row and added a square image to each column. Next I enabled the “Make Row Fullwidth” to extend the row to the edges of the browser window.\n\nNext I reduced the “Gutter Width” size to “1” to remove the spacing between columns in the row.\n\nFinally I removed the padding above and below the row by changing “Custom Padding” top and bottom values to “0.”\n\n\nThe result is a complete transformation of the row, turning our normal 4 column row of images into a full-width and full-bleed image gallery that looks stunning against the green section below it. This same effect can be created using custom column background colors and text-based modules as well. The possibilities are endless!"

These actions include: Undo, Redo, Save to Library, Disable, Lock, and Copy & Paste. You may be familiar with many of these functions already as they’re fairly common. Which is why we’ve added them to the Right Click controls for your convenience! This way you don’t have to dig into the module settings to access commonly-used features. Some of the functions, however, are unique to Right Click, and are only available when right clicking. These include: Copy, Paste, and Lock.\n\nUndo & Redo\n\nAny action you take within the Divi Builder can be undone, and any undo can also be re-done. Undo & Redo controls (which are also available using the editing history button found in the main page controls that hover at the bottom of the enabled visual builder interface) can also be accessed when right clicking.\n\nSave To Library\n\nThe option to save an element to the Divi Library has been added to Divi’s right click controls for convenience. Using this feature you can save items to the library without having to open up the relevant settings box.\n\nDisable\n\nAny Module, Row or Section can be disabled. Once an item is disabled, it will appear to fade into the background. This reduced opacity is meant to indicate that the element is disabled but still allow you to see and edit it while the Divi Builder is activated. When this action has been saved and the visual builder has been exited the disabled element will disappear altogether.\n\nDisabling is a great way to remove things from view without actually deleting them in the builder. They can then be re-enabled in the future.\n\nLock\n\nLocking is a function that is only available via Divi’s right click controls. Once an item has been locked, it cannot be moved, edited or deleted until it has been unlocked. Only users with the Administrator role have the ability to lock and unlock items. This means you can assign your clients a lesser role, such as Editor, and they won’t be able to edit any item that has been locked. This is a great way to control what your clients can and cannot edit. Often times you might want to lock everything except for text modules, for example, which would allow your client to edit their content, but would not allow them to adjust the settings of more advanced modules.\n\nCopy & Paste\n\nWith Divi’s right-click controls you can copy any module, row, or section from one area and then paste it into another area. You can even copy and paste just the style of an element and copy it onto another element of the same type. For example, if you have four blurbs in a row you could style one the way you want and then simply copy and paste that blurb’s style onto the others. These copy and paste features will save you loads of time and boring repetition!"

That means you have access to hundreds of high-quality and professionally designed website layouts for FREE, included with your Elegant Themes membership. New layout packs are added weekly! Let’s take a look at how to access, load, and customize pre-made layout packs with Divi.\n\nHow To Access Divi Premade Layout Packs\n\nIn order to access the Divi Premade Layout Packs you’ll need an Elegant Themes membership. You can browse our layout packs here, however, to install a layout pack you’ll need a WordPress website with Divi installed.Learn how to install the Divi theme on your WordPress website here. Once you have the Divi theme installed and activated, we can begin using the features and functionalities of Divi.\n\nAdd a Page and Load the Divi Builder\n\nTo get started, add a new page to your website. By default, the Standard Gutenberg Editor loads whenever a new post or page is added in WordPress. To load the Divi builder on any post or page, click the purple button underneath the page title that says “Use The Divi Builder”.\n\nOnce clicked, this will reload the page with the Divi Visual Builder. As your page reloads, you’ll notice three options that come up: Build From Scratch, Choose A Premade Layout, and Clone An Existing Page.\n\nBuild From Scratch\n\nThis option loads the Divi Builder with a blank page design. Choose this option if you’d like to start your page design from scratch.\n\nChoose a Premade Layout\n\nThis option allows you to choose from our large library of pre-designed Divi layouts. You can choose from premade layouts by Divi, pre-made layouts you’ve designed and saved to your Divi Library, and existing pages on your website that you can clone.\n\nClone an Existing Page\n\nThis option allows you to copy another page design on your website and use it for the page you’re editing. Select this option if you’d like to load an exact copy of an existing page that you’ve already designed on your website.\n\nSelect, Choose a Premade Layout.\n\nIn the Load From Library popup you will have three tabs available. The Premade Layouts tab is where you will find all of the premade layouts created by the Elegant Themes design team free for you to use. The “Your Saved Layouts” tab is where you can access any layouts you personally have saved to the Divi Library. And the “Your Existing Pages” tab will contain a list of all the pages (including posts and projects) currently on your website where you may choose to clone an existing page to kickstart the design of a new page.\n\nHow to Search For Premade Layout Packs\n\nSearching through premade layout packs is easy. Use the search and filter options on the sidebar to find layout packs.\n\nHow to Load A Premade Layout Pack\n\nOnce you’ve found the layout pack you’d like to use, click on it and then click “Use This Layout” to load the layout onto the page. You can search through the premade layout library at any time by clicking the purple “+” icon on the Divi toolbar to bring up the Divi Library.\n\nCustomization and Flexibility\n\nThe ability to add premade layouts to kickstart the building of a new page opens up a world of flexibility for creating your own unique layouts. Once the layouts are deployed, you can edit them however you would like. For example, if you like a particular layout, but would rather not have a certain section, simply delete it by clicking on the trash can icon for that section and its gone! By replacing each element on the page with your own content you can have a beautiful, custom site in just minutes.\n\nHow to Customize Premade Layout Packs\n\nCustomizing premade layout packs is easy because it’s exactly how you’d customize anything in Divi! Nothing is locked or off-limits and you can customize to your heart’s content. Simply drag and drop elements to rearrange them, or click into an element’s settings to tweak the design.\n\nSave Your Design\n\nBefore exiting the page, make sure to save your design. You can do so by clicking the green “Save” button in the bottom right corner, or by typing CMD + SAVE. If you don’t like the changes you’ve made you type CMD + Z to undo it (or use the editing history button to roll back multiple actions all at once).\n\nContinue Learning\nLearn The Divi Basics\nBrowse More Divi Documentation\nStay up to date with all of our latest Divi Premade Layout Packs tutorials by checking out our #divi-premade-layout-packs page."

It’s great to include it on product pages to help increase sales and conversions. The Divi Woo Related Products module is one of the building block modules for creating customized eCommerce pages in the Theme Builder.\n\nInstall Divi and WooCommerce\n\nBefore we can use the Divi Woo Related Products module you’ll need to have both Divi and WooCommerce installed on your website. Once you have the Divi theme installed and activated, we can begin using the features and functionalities of Divi.\n\nFor additional information on the Divi Builder itself, its interface, usage philosophy and best practices, please refer to our Getting Started With The Divi Builder guide.\n\nHow to Add the Divi Woo Related Products Module To Your Page\n\nIn this doc, we’ll be adding the Divi Woo Related Products Module to the Cart Page. This is a great way to suggest related products to customers as they are viewing their cart.\n\nThe Cart Page is built as a Page Template within the Divi Theme Builder. The Divi Theme Builder allows us to create and design eCommerce page templates easily. To learn more about the Divi Theme Builder click here.\n\nNavigate To The Divi Theme Builder\n\nNavigate to the WordPress Dashboard and go to Divi > Theme Builder on the left sidebar. This takes you to the Theme Builder dashboard where all of the custom templates for your website live.\n\nAdd a New Cart Page Template\n\nFirst, we’ll need to create the Cart Page Template. To do so click “Add New Template”.\n\nOnce you have selected “Create Template” you’ll have two options: Build New Template or Add From Library.\n\nOption 1: Build New Template\n\nIf you’d like to start designing from scratch, select “Build New Template”. When selected, this will load a blank page template with the global header and global footer applied. If you don’t want to use the global header or footer you can disable or delete them.\n\nOption 2: Add From Library\n\nTo import a premade layout pack click “Add From Library”. This will load the Divi Library where you can browse premade layout packs. Learn how to import premade layout packs from the Divi library here.\n\nImport via Portability\n\nThere is one other way to import a pre-made design into the Divi Theme Builder. That is by importing a JSON file using Divi’s portability feature. Learn how to do this here.\n\nAdd Custom Body\nNow that the default template is loaded, click “Add Custom Body”.\n\nThen click “Build Custom Body”.\n\nNow your page should look like this: a blank page template.\n\nHow To Add The Divi Woo Related Products Module\n\nTo add the Divi Woo Related Products module your page needs a section and a row first. New pages and page templates are loaded with a standard section already populated on the page. To add a row click the green “+” button and select the column structure you want.\n\nNext, click the gray “+” icon to load the module library. Click “Woo Modules” to view all the Divi Woo Modules.\n\nThen click “Woo Related Products” to add it to your page.\n\nNote: The module library is also searchable! Use the search bar at the top of the module library to type in the name of the module you are looking for.\n\nAll Divi Woo Related Products Module Settings Explained\n\nOnce the module is added to the page, the module settings window automatically pops up. This is where all of the content and design styles for the module are configured. These settings are organized into three groups via the tabs at the top of the module: Content, Design, and Advanced.\n\nContent Settings\n\nInside this tab, you’ll find all of the content options available for the module.\n\nContent\n\nThe first settings group is also called Content, where you can control what type of content is displayed and how.\n\nProduct– This setting allows you to specify which product you want the module to relate to when it shows related products. By default, it’s set to “This Product”.

By default, all categories are displayed. To select a category, click its corresponding checkbox. When a category or categories are selected, only those will display. For this module, we’ll select “This Product” so that it displays related products to the product currently being viewed by the visitor.\nProduct Offset Number – Here you can choose how many products you would like to skip. They won’t be displayed in the feed. For example, if you have a total of 12 products but only want products 2-12 to display, type “1” in this field.\n\nElements\n\nHere you can choose what product information is displayed.\n\nShow Name – Toggle this option to “yes” or “no” to show or hide the name of the product.\nShow Image – Toggle this option to “yes” or “no” to show or hide the product image.\nShow Price – Toggle this option to “yes” or “no” to show or hide the product price.\nShow Rating – Toggle this option to “yes” or “no” to show or hide the product rating.\nShow Sale Badge – Toggle this option to “yes” or “no” to show or hide the sale badge.\n\nLink\n\nIf you would like to apply a clickable link to the entire module, you can do so here.\n\nModule Link URL – Paste the URL of the link you would like to apply to this module here. This makes the entire module clickable and when clicked it will direct visitors to the URL pasted here.\nModule Link Target – Defining a link target determines whether the link, when clicked, opens in a new tab or in the same window. Choose “In The Same Window” if you want the link to open in the same window and click “In The New Tab” if you would like that link to open in a new tab. By default, “In The Same Window” is selected.\n\nBackground\n\nThis is where you can add a background color, gradient, image, video, pattern, or mask to this module.\n\nHow to Add a Background Color\n\nTo add a background color to the entire module, click the first tab, the paint bucket.

When new versions of our themes or plugins become available, update notifications will appear in the Dashboard > Updates page of your WordPress Dashboard, as well as within the Themes & Plugins manager. It is important to always keep your themes and plugins updated to ensure compatibility with the latest version of WordPress, to keep your website secure, and to take advantage of the latest and greatest features! Before you can update, you must first authenticate your Elegant Themes subscription by inputting your Username and API Key into the Updates tab of your theme or plugin settings. Only members with active Elegant Themes accounts have access to the latest versions of our products. Your Username is the username you use when logging in to ElegantThemes.com, and your API Key can be found by logging into your Elegant Themes account and clicking on the Account > Your API Key link. Once you have authenticated your account, you can click the update link when you receive an update notification to automatically update your theme or plugin.\n\nUpdate Notifications\n\nWhen new updates become available for any of our themes or plugins, a notification will appear in the Dashboard > Updates page of your website’s WordPress Dashboard.\n\nAuthenticating Your Membership\n\nBefore you can update your theme or plugin, you must first authenticate your Elegant Themes subscription. Only members with active accounts have access to product updates. To authenticate your account, you will be asked to input two pieces of information into your theme or plugin settings panel: 1) Your Username and 2) Your API Key. Your username is the same username you use when logging in to your ElegantThemes.com account, and your API Key is a unique identifier used to authenticate your account that is only available to you when logging in. To locate your API Key, log in to the Elegant Themes members area and click on the Account > Your API Key link. Copy the API Key displayed on the page. You will by pasting this key into your Theme or Plugin options page.\n\n\nOnce you have copied your API Key, you will need to use it to authenticate your account by pasting it into your theme or plugin options page. Log in to your website’s WordPress Dashboard and navigate to your theme or plugin options page. For Divi, this can be found by clicking the Divi > Theme Options link.\n\nOnce you have loaded your theme or plugin options page, look for the Updates tab. Click the Updates tab to reveal the Username and API Key fields. Type your username into the Username field and paste the API Key you copied earlier into the API Key field. You should confirm that you have not copied any extra white spaces by mistake. Click save to complete the account authorization.\n\nOnce you have entered your credentials, you are now ready to update your theme. Click on the Dashboard > Updates tab and update your theme or plugin normally using the WordPress update interface. If you do not see any update notifications, or you receive an authentication error when updating, try waiting a bit and then check back later. Sometimes WordPress will cache update notifications and it can take some time for them to appear correctly.\n\nManaging API Keys\n\nAPI keys can be managed with the Elegant Themes member’s area. Here you can add new API Keys as well as deactivate keys that you have generated in the past. If you are using Divi on different client websites, it’s often a good idea to generate a new key for each site. If your relationship with the client is terminated, you can deactivate their API key."

    "html": "Divi Builder Plugin Documentation\nENTER SEARCH TERM\nDIVI\nEXTRA\nBLOOM\nMONARCH\nDIVI BUILDER\nDEVELOPERS\nBACK TO DIVI BUILDER PLUGIN DOCUMENTATION\nUsing Selective Sync In Divi\n\nSelect which part of the global library item you would like to sync.\n\nSync Only Parts Of A Global Library Item\n\nSelective Sync allows you to save individual settings when saving a new global library item. You can choose to selectively sync any or all of the Content, Design, or Advanced tabs. For example, if you save a new module to the library as a global item, you can edit the settings to only sync the Design Settings, then only these settings will be added to the library. This is especially useful if you are delving into the Design or Advanced Tabs, and would like to use your unique styles for multiple modules on your website while at the same time adding unique content in the Content tab for each.\n\nA simple example would be to create a uniquely-styled Header Module that is added to every page on your website. In this example you may want to have a unique combination of Design Settings shared across your entire website, but at the same time you need to be able to add unique title text to each module to represent the current page. In this example, choosing to selectively sync only the Design Settings makes the most sense.\n\nUsing Selective Sync\n\nUsing the Visual Builder, save a new item to your library and check the box to make it a global item. Then click to edit the settings of your module. You will see a small sync icon to the left of all the options within the Content, Design, and Advanced tabs. Click this icon to enable or disable the option to selectively sync any or all of the settings for the current global library item and click save. Only the options that you have selected will be editable within the library. When you add the global library item to your page, only the settings you have checked to be synced will be present.\n\nWhenever you edit a global module, you can easily identify which options are currently being synced by the green color of the sync icon. Icons that are green are options that are currently being synced within the global module. Red means the item isn’t synced. Options edited with the green (enabled) sync icons are shared by all instances of the global item.\n\nThe Power of Selectively Sync\n\nUsing Selective Sync in combination with global modules can be extremely powerful. Let’s dig a little deeper. Let’s say you have a Fullwidth Header module at the top of all of your pages. This is quite common. Each header module has a different title in the “Content” settings to represent the current page. You have also used the “Design” settings to give your header a unique look by adjusting the title font style to Bold & All Caps, and you have increase the Custom Padding on the top and bottom of the header to make the header module larger. You want all of you header modules on each page to use this unique style, but you need each page to have unique titles. In this case, you can create a Global Fullwidth Header module and choose to selectively sync only the options in the “Design” tab. Now whenever you add this global module to a new page, the “Design” settings will be synced, but your “Content” settings will remain unique for the current module.\n\nIf you ever want to change the style of the headers on all your page, you can modify the synced “Design” settings shared by these global modules and the changes will be reflected on every single page that global header has been used! Wow, that saves you an incredible amount of time!\n\nThis same theory could be applied to the “Advanced” tab as well. Let’s say that you have created a Slider Module and used the “Advanced” tab to apply a unique animation to the slider’s button. You want to use this new unique animation on all of the Slider Modules on your website. In this case, you can create a new Global Slider Module and selectively sync the “Advanced” settings which include your custom CSS animation. Add this slider to your page and adjust the “Content” and “Design” settings freely, while keeping your unique Custom CSS synced across the entire series of modules. If you ever want to adjust the “Advanced” settings for this series of global modules, you only have to do it once.

You can define a set of conditions such as user role, date and time, browser, device, post information, website location, and more.\n\nFor example, you can choose to display specific content based on date and time. Or you can choose to display unique content to users when they log in and show unique elements to specific users based on their user role.\n\nThis is a powerful feature within Divi, so in this document, we’ll go over how to access the Divi Condition Options, how to use them, best tips and practices, and more.\n\nLet’s dive in!\n\nHow To Access Condition Options\n\nCondition options are available in all of Divi’s sections, rows, and modules. Simply hover over the element you’re working on, click the gear icon to bring up the settings, and then navigate to Advanced > Conditions.\n\nAdd a Condition\n\nTo add a condition, click the grey + icon that says “Add Condition”. This will bring up all of the condition options that you can apply.\n\nShowing or Hiding Elements\n\nTo show or hide an element, you’ll need to add a condition that will control an element’s visibility. When conditions are met the element will be visible. When conditions are not met the element will be hidden. For example, below a member’s only discount banner will display only if the user is logged into the website.\n\nSetting Multiple Conditions\n\nWithin the Divi Condition Options, you’re able to apply multiple conditions to create advanced rules for an element’s visibility. You can choose to display or hide an element based on whether all or one of the conditions are met.\n\nFor example, you can choose to show a discount code banner IF that user is logged in, has purchased a product before, and is using a browser. You can make all of these three conditions required to be met, or just one condition to be met, in order for the banner to be visible.\n\nUse Case Examples of Condition Options\n\nLet’s take a look at some real-life use examples for condition options.\n\nCreate Personalized Experiences\n\nThe Divi Condition Options gives you the power to tailor personalized user experiences for every visitor that comes to your website.

This retargeting technique can help you close more sales, boost profits, and engage more customers.\n\nOne effective way to retarget customers is to offer return customers a discount or promo code on the items they added to their cart previously. However, the important part is to offer these discounts only to users who have abandoned their carts. Using the Divi Condition Options allows you to show or hide content based on a user’s WooCommerce cart content and page visits. This conditions combination makes it possible to retarget those users who have abandoned their carts with a discount or promo pop-up.

Let’s delve into how to use the system, and cover some best practices to make the most out of your Divi experience.\n\nOverview of Divi Drag and Drop File Upload\n\nBuilding webpages is easy using Divi’s drag and drop feature. You can upload files individually or add multiple files at once. Once the file is dropped into the builder, files convert to modules instantly. This is a huge time saver and is a revolutionary experience for those who are looking to build websites more efficiently. Here is what happens when you drag and drop a file into the Divi Builder when editing your page:\n\nDivi creates a new regular section with a one column row at the bottom of your page layout.\nDivi Creates a new module and fills it with your file content based on the type of file.\nDivi adds the new module inside the one-column row of the section that was created at the bottom of the page.\nFor convenience, the module settings modal will pop up automatically so you can start customizing the design of your content.\n\nSupported File Types for Drag and Drop Uploads\n\nThe Drag and Drop feature supports file types that every developer uses to add content and design to their pages. Here is list of all file types currently supported by the Drag & Drop feature that you can use:\n\nImage Files (jpg, png, tif, gif)\nText Files (txt)\nVideo Files (m4v, mov, webm, wmv, mp4)\nAudio Files (mp3, wav)\nWeb Files (json, html, css)\nFont Files (otf, ttf) (\n\nNow that we understand more of what the Drag and Drop feature is, let’s explore how this convenient feature works for each file type.\n\nThe Drag and Drop Functionality for Each File Type\nImage File Uploads\n\nDivi’s Drag and Drop functionality streamlines the design process of adding new images to your page using the Divi Builder.\n\nWhen using the Drag and Drop feature for images, there are four supported image formats:\n\njpg\npng\ntif\ngif\nSingle Image Drag and Drop Functionality\n\nIf you want to add a single image from your computer to your web page when using the Divi Builder, just drag the image from your computer to the browser screen using the Divi Builder.\n\nDivi will automatically upload the image to your media gallery and apply the image to an image module ready for you to use. For extra convenience, the image gallery settings modal will automatically pop up so you can make any changes to your new image.\n\nMultiple Images Drag and Drop Functionality\n\nIf you want to add multiple images from your computer at once to your Divi Builder page, simply select all the images you want to use on your computer and drag them over into the Divi Builder. Divi will automatically upload all the images, convert them into an image gallery module, and create a new section displaying your new image gallery. You can rename your files before dragging them into your page, in order for them to display custom titles.\n\nText File Uploads\n\nText files (with txt format) import with ease into Divi. To add a TXT file, drag it into the Visual Builder. Divi will add the TXT file into a text module within a new section.\n\nWeb File Uploads: Add Divi Layouts, HTML Code, or CSS\n\nThe drag and drop file upload feature can import several web file types. We’ll show you how to import them into Divi.\n\nWhen using the Drag and Drop feature for web files, there are three supported file formats:\n\nJSON\nCSS\nHTML\nJSON File Uploads: Importing Divi Layouts with Ease\n\nThe JSON file extension is used for dragging complete page layouts or sections into any Divi page. Dragging in a JSON file automatically loads the content into the page. When importing JSON files, you can choose to overwrite the content on an existing page, or start from scratch with a blank page.\n\nCSS File Uploads: Quickly Add Custom CSS Styles to Pages with Drag and Drop\n\nDragging CSS files into the Visual Builder adds custom CSS to your page. Once imported, it’s inserted into the custom CSS section of the page settings. It’s important to note that when adding custom CSS, be sure to add a class to the module or element that you wish to add CSS to. Basically, whatever you name the CSS file, that title will be used to comment out the block of CSS which is a cool feature.\n\nDivi Organizes CSS Code With Each Drop\n\nWhen you drag CSS snippets into your page, they are automatically added into the page CSS. You can view it anytime from the page settings > advanced tab. Divi will organize your css snippet by wrapping it with comments. Comments are used within CSS code to identify or describe the blocks of code. Divi adds the comment before your code starts.\n\nFor instance, let’s say you have a CSS snippet for an audio module on your page. When you drag it into the builder, it gets applied to your page and automatically adds a begin and end comment to the CSS.\n\nHTML File Uploads: Add Custom HTML Code to a Page with Drag and Drop\n\nDivi users can drag and drop HTML directly into their pages. The HTML code is added into a code module in a new section. Adding HTML files to your page can be useful for adding new web design elements to your pages.\n\nFont File Uploads: Add Custom Fonts to Divi with Drag and Drop\n\nImporting new custom fonts to your Divi site is made easy with the drag and drop file upload feature. All you have to do is drag the font file from your computer into the Divi Builder when editing a page. There are two font files supported in the drag and drop file upload system:\n\notf\nttf\n\nTo import a font, drag the font file into your page with the Divi Builder active. Divi will launch the font upload modal with the font name already present. Be sure to confirm the font weights before clicking the upload button.\n\nOnce done, you will have a brand new custom font inside the Divi Builder that you can use when adding new content or modules to the page.\n\nVideo File Uploads: Add Videos to Your Page with Drag and Drop\n\nUsing the Drag and Drop feature for video files, you can easily add videos to your pages using the Divi Builder. The feature supports the following video file formats:\n\nmp4\nwebm\nmov\nwmv\nm4v\n\nDropping any of these video file types into the builder creates a new video module in a new section. In seconds, your video is added to your page and ready for you to design using the Divi Builder. Adding multiple video files at once will create a new module and section for each.\n\nAudio File Uploads: Convert Audio Files to Audio Modules with Drag and Drop\n\nAdding new audio files to your page is only a drag and drop away with this feature. Currently, the following audio file formats are supported:\n\nmp3\nwav\n\nWhen you drag and drop an audio file into the builder, the file is automatically converted to a new Divi Audio Module in a new section at the bottom of the page. With a single drop, you will have your new audio file embedded into a customizable audio player that is fully customizable with Divi’s built-in design options. You can drop in one or more audio files at one time.\n\nExample Use Cases\n\nThere are a number of ways to benefit from Divi’s drag and drop upload file feature. Whether you want to upload multiple images at once, or combine code snippets to save time, there are plenty of uses for it. Let’s take a closer look at a couple of the best ways to use it.\n\nDrag and Drop Multiple Images to Create Photo Galleries with Titles\n\nDivi’s Drag and Drop functionality allows you to drag images to your site with ease. This really comes in handy when building websites with a lot of images. And since most people keep saved images in a folder on their computer, it is extremely convenient to be able to select those images and drag them into your page.\n\nCombine Files and CSS Snippets in One Go\n\nIf you want to make design changes to sections of your page or extend the functionality of a Divi module, you can drag and drop supported file types along with CSS files to be uploaded at once. This is a great way to enhance the amazing capabilities of Divi with custom designs and functionality. This allows developers to add any supported file type and CSS combinations to Divi all in one single action.\n\nThis can be a great way to add custom image gallery grids, advanced HTML videos, audio, and so much more.\n\nCheck out our blog to view some of our amazing CSS tutorials to add features to Divi modules.\n\nBasic CSS That Every WordPress User Needs to Know\nHow to Design CSS Text Backgrounds in Divi Using background-clip\nHow to Create a CSS Grid Layout for Divi Modules\nExploring How to Create and Animate CSS Shapes in Divi\nHow to create custom HTML5 video controls for a video in Divi\nImporting Lordicon Icon JSON Files\n\nLordicon icons are SVG’s that can be imported into your Divi website to create cool animation effects. Animation is an important element to consider because it can help keep your site’s visitors engaged. Lordicon uses JSON files that you can drag and drop into Divi. Check out our in-depth post on Lordicon icons and how to incorporate them into Divi.\n\nTips & Best Practices when Using Divi’s Drag and Drop File Upload Feature\n\nWhen using Divi’s drag and drop file upload feature, there are a few best practices that you should follow. Doing so ensures that you save yourself the time that the feature is intended for. Things like optimizing images, adding titles to images before upload, and using clean codes are just a few ways to make the upload go smoothly.\n\nOptimize Images Before Uploading into Drag and Drop File Upload\n\nIt’s always a good idea to make sure that you use optimized images on your website. Large images increase your page loading time. That can lead to your site’s visitors becoming frustrated. Additionally, images that aren’t optimized will take up a lot of space. Depending on the amount of storage you have on your hosting plan, this could be a huge issue. When using the drag and drop feature to upload multiple images to your website, the idea is to save time. If your images are large, you could have to wait a considerable amount of time to import your images.\n\nRename Image Titles\n\nBefore dragging and dropping multiple images into a page, it’s a good idea to name them prior to dragging and dropping them in. Divi automatically displays the titles of your image files, so you’ll want to avoid titles such as image-1, image-2, etc.\n\nUpload Web Files with Clean Code\n\nIt is important to clean up your HTML or CSS files before importing them into your Divi website. Importing poorly written HTML content can cause your Divi website to break, costing you valuable time. It’s a good idea to test your code and make any changes before you’re ready to drag it into your webpages. You can use code editors to test out your HTML code off-site to make sure it works properly.\n\nUpload CSS with Unique CSS Classes\n\nWhen adding custom CSS to you Divi page, it’s important to use CSS classes that won’t interfere with Divi’s internal components. Be sure to use unique classes like my-custom-blog or cool-blurb to ensure that your code doesn’t overwrite important system css classes.\n\nStyle your File Uploads with Divi Global Presets\n\nDivi’s Global Presets allow you to control the design of your page elements site-wide.\n\nHaving these Global Presets in place will make it easy to apply the same consistent design when using the divi drag and drop file upload feature. For example, if you have a default preset in place for images or image galleries, those styles will be added automatically when you drag and drop new images to your page. In addition, you can apply any saved global preset to the module displaying your new file upload content. This will change the design of the uploaded content to match your site in just a few clicks.\n\nIf you don’t have global presets in place, you can always use Divi’s Find & Replace feature to find instances of color, text, or modules and replace them with saved module settings, headings, or color presets.\n\nUtilize Divi Cloud\n\nWith Divi Cloud, you can save JSON page layouts in the cloud to make them easier to access when reusing them in your Divi pages. Furthermore, Divi Cloud is great for storing all kinds of content. You can save modules, rows, sections, or entire layout packs which makes it fast and easy to import into your newly created Divi pages. Combining drag and drop with Divi Cloud is a fantastic way to save time and implement your favorite code snippets, modules, and pages on other Divi websites.\n\nContinue Learning\n6 Ways You Can Use Divi’s Drag & Drop File Upload Feature to Boost Productivity\nHow to Use Lordicon with WordPress and Divi\n10+ Tutorials to Help You Get Started with Divi Cloud"

    "html": "Divi Builder Plugin Documentation\nENTER SEARCH TERM\nDIVI\nEXTRA\nBLOOM\nMONARCH\nDIVI BUILDER\nDEVELOPERS\nBACK TO DIVI BUILDER PLUGIN DOCUMENTATION\nUsing the Divi Gradient Builder\n\nHow to add and edit gradients throughout your Divi designs.\n\nGradients are a great way to add interest and depth to your webpages. They can be created with two or more colors, various levels of transparency, and combined with pattern effects to create stunning visuals for your website. Let’s take a look at how to use the Divi Gradient Builder and explore all of the options available with it.\n\nAdding a Background Gradient\n\nDivi’s Gradient Builder is part of Divi’s suite of background design options. Adding a gradient to any section, row, column, or module is easy. To demonstrate how to add gradients to a section, we’ll use one of Divi’s layout packs.\n\nTo add a gradient, click on any section in the visual builder to bring up the editing options. Scroll down to locate the background section. Click the Background gradient tab. Then, click the + Add Background Gradient button to add a gradient.\n\nOnce clicked, the default gradient will be applied.\n\nHow to Set Divi Gradient Builder Colors\n\nTo set the colors for a gradient, you’ll need to use the color stops. Start by clicking on the first color stop to add your first color.\n\nColors can be added via the color picker. Then repeat the process to set the second color stop for your gradient.\n\nHow to Use More Than Two Colors\n\nWith the Divi Gradient Builder, you can add more than two color stops to any gradient. You can add as many colors as you would like. To add another color stop, simply click into the gradient slider to add a color.\n\nOnce added, click and hold to slide the color stop anywhere you’d like within the gradient slider. When two or more color stops are used, colors can be adjusted to create more complex gradients. Additionally, you can right click on each color stop to do things like find & replace a color, or to remove it.\n\nHow to Overlap Gradient Stops\n\nYou can choose to overlap any of the color stops in the Divi gradient builder to create cool effects. For example, if you’d like to have a sharp line between your color stops, you can click into or right click on any color stop to slide it over another one. Doing so adds a sharp division of color into the gradient. This can be useful to create a striped background effect for your gradients.\n\nIn this example, three color stops are used. The left most color stop is placed directly over the middle one. This gives the gradient a solid color for the first 33% of the gradient, then uses the second and third color stops to create a smoothly blended gradient effect.\n\nPlacing a Gradient over a Background Image in the Divi Gradient Builder\n\nIn some situations, you may want to place your gradient over a background image. This allows for the background image being used to display underneath the gradient. Simply toggle Place Gradient Above Background Image to yes.\n\nAs seen in the screenshot above, even though the toggle is set to yes, the background image we have applied isn’t showing. This is because you’ll need to adjust the transparency of your color stops. You can choose to adjust the transparency of one or all of your color stops to change the effect. To adjust transparency of the color stop, click a color stop in the gradient slider. Next, adjust the transparency of the stop by adjusting the transparency slider options.\n\nDivi Gradient Builder Types\n\nThere are four gradient types available within the Divi Gradient Builder. Linear, circular, elliptical, and conical. Let’s discuss each type and demonstrate how to configure each.\n\nLinear Gradient\n\nWhen first adding a background gradient, the linear gradient type is selected by default. For the linear option, you can choose the direction for your gradient. 180 degrees is the default position, but this can be adjusted however you wish. For exmample, switching the direction to 90 degrees will display the gradient horizontally. To adjust the direction, you may click and drag the gradient direction slider, or type a specific value into the field.\n\nCircular Gradient\n\nThe circular gradient applies a round gradient effect to your background. You can define the position for your circular gradient using the dropdown menu associated with it. In the screenshot below, we have a top left position applied. However, you can choose from several options including center, top, top right, right, bottom right, bottom, bottom left, and left. Each setting has a unique look, so we encourage you to take time with each position to determine which one works best with your design.\n\nElliptical Gradient\n\nThe elliptical gradient is similar to the circular one in that it provides the same position options. However, instead of applying a circle, it uses more of an egg-shaped gradient to the background.\n\nConical Gradient\n\nThe final choice for gradient type in the Divi Gradient Builder is the conical gradient. Similar to the linear gradient type, the conical selection gives users the ability to define the gradient direction, as well as the gradient position.\n\nRepeating Gradients With the Divi Gradient Builder\n\nWhen repeating gradient is toggled to yes, the gradient that is currently applied will be duplicated. Looks will vary depending on the gradient type you choose. Repeating the gradient applies an interesting design element to your backgrounds. The more color stops you choose, the more drastic the change.\n\nRepeating Patterns and Interesting Effects\n\nSome cool design effects can be achieved by combining gradient type with the gradient repeat option along with gradient units. When certain gradient types are selected, an additional option for gradient unit is displayed. Linear, circular, and elliptical gradient types allow Divi users to create stunning background gradients to add dimension to their designs.\n\nDivi Gradient Builder Units\n\nGradient units are used to specify what the gradient stop numbers on the slide bar indicate. Additionally, they determine how the stops are measured. They affect the pattern created by the repeat options. When implementing gradient units, consider how your design will change based on the unit selected. In our example, we use the percent gradient unit. Our color stops are set to 0, 2, and 10. The opacity on all three stops is set to 70% or .7. We’ve chosen the circular gradient type, set the position to top left, and toggled repeat gradient to yes.\n\nBy applying the settings from the percent unit example, our design changes as we select different units.\n\nBest Practices for Using the Divi Gradient Builder\n\nUsing gradients is an excellent way to add color, depth and eye-catching effects. When used properly, they can improve design and capture your site visitor’s attention. In order to get the most from Divi’s Gradient Builder, we will outline a few best practices to follow.\n\nFocus on Color Families\n\nChoosing the right colors for your gradients is an essential step. After all, you’re probably not creating a website for clowns. Choose hues of one color to create subtle gradients that are pleasing to the eye. Consider using Divi’s Color Management System to achieve visual balance in your designs.\n\nA good example of how to use color families in your gradients can be found in Divi’s Private Investigator layout pack. As you can see, this design does a good job of utilizing colors within the same family to create an eye-catching design with similar colors.\n\nAnalogous Colors Are Your Friend\n\nAnalagous colors live next to one another on the color wheel. Using them is pleasing to the eye and a basic principle of color theory. In fact, brands such as BP, Red Bull, and MasterCard use analagous colors in their branding. As previously mentioned, using Divi’s dynamic magic color system is a great way to choose colors for your gradients. Additionally, Adobe Color is a great source. It can be used to generate color palettes based on analagous, monochromatic, complementary, and other color harmonies. In addition, there are pre-made color themes available. As an added bonus, Adobe Color is free to use.\n\nAnalagous colors doesn’t have to apply to just colors used in elements. You can expand on the use of them by choosing images for your design that incorporate those principles as well. For example, take a look at Divi’s Leather Goods layout pack. The images used in the layouts are a perfect example of picking images that fall within the alalogous color wheel.\n\nVary Gradient Types\n\nTo avoid being monotonous, use different gradient types on your webpages. For example, try not to use the same gradient background on every page. Subtle changes create a more dynamic design that keeps your site’s visitor engaged. If you’re using a linear gradient in your hero section, swap things up a bit by choosing a circular or conical background gradient in another section on the same page.\n\nThe same is true for using gradient backgrounds in elements such as buttons. Try using different gradient backgrounds for your call to actions (CTA) as well as section backgrounds. A great example of this is seen in Divi’s Digital Marketing layout pack.\n\nAvoid Overuse of Colors\n\nWhile color is essential in good design, it’s easy to overdo it. Limit colors to 3-4, and use hues to create balance. Too many colors can confuse or overwhelm visitors. On the other hand, try to incorporate more than two colors in your gradients. Limiting colors in a gradient can cause your gradient to appear muddy and unpleasant. Try using a third color of the same family. This will add depth and an interesting element to your gradient.\n\nLet’s take a look at Divi’s Online Yoga layout pack as an example. While visually stunning, the layout limits color usage to 4 colors. The gradients used in the page contain two muted colors, allowing for the text to pop. There are two additionaly colors used throughout the page to provide pops of color without being overwhelming.\n\nStick to Good UX Principles\n\nLegibility is key. Ensure that regardless of the type of gradient you choose, the content over it is easy to read. Consider stacking text and buttons to one side of the section where the gradient is being used. If using light text, place a darker color underneath.\n\nThe Divi Whiskey Distillery layout pack is a great example of balancing a background gradient with text overlay.

    "html": "Divi Builder Plugin Documentation\nENTER SEARCH TERM\nDIVI\nEXTRA\nBLOOM\nMONARCH\nDIVI BUILDER\nDEVELOPERS\nBACK TO DIVI BUILDER PLUGIN DOCUMENTATION\nUsing the Divi Layers View\n\nDivi’s Layer View provides an efficient way to navigate your page’s elements while designing.\n\nThe Divi layers view adds a very quick and easy way to view, rearrange, edit, and rename your elements. This is especially true when you have elements that have transition effects or negative margins on them that would normally be tricky to click on the traditional way.\n\nThe Power of Divi’s Layers View\n\nDivi’s layers view gives you easy access to any element within your page. It’s small, so you can keep it open in a corner or wherever is convenient for you during the design process. Additionally, the layers view works well to help you access elements in complex designs with overlapping elements or altered transform controls. When the layers view is active, you can click on any section, row, column, or module to edit it with ease.\n\nAccessing the Layers View Panel\n\nThere are two ways to access the Divi layers view panel. The first is to activate the page menu by clicking the purple ellipsis in the bottom center of the screen. Next, click the layers icon to activate the panel.\n\nAdditionally, you can right-click any element on the page to bring up the menu options. From there, click go to layer. When the panel appears, you’ll have access to every section and all elements within the page.\n\nHow To Use Layers View Panel\n\nThe Divi layers view panel interface is easy to navigate, and allows for many actions including expanding and collapsing layers, dragging and dropping, filtering available options, multi-selecting layers, and much more. Let’s examine the interface so you can familiarize yourself with the tools that are available to you.\n\nSearch Layers: You can search elements, named layers, or any element on the page.\nFilter Layers: You can filter by element, module, rows, and more by typing into the filter field.\nOpen/Close All Layers: Click to either open or close all layers at once for easy viewing.\nToggle Layer Section: Click the icon to expand/close a single section.\nEdit: Click the gear icon to edit the element.\nDuplicate Layer: You can duplicate sections, rows, columns, or modules.\nDelete Layer: Deletes the selected layer.\nLayers Menu: Opens the layer’s extended menu. Includes options for saving to library or Divi Cloud, split test, disable, lock, expand section, copy section, copy styles, view modified styles, extend styles, and preset options.\nExpanding and Collapsing Layers\n\nYou can expand and collapse layers with ease. Simply click either the open/close all icon, or individual layers to control the elements contained within each section.\n\nDrag and Drop Layers\n\nWithin the Divi layers view, you can drag and drop elements, rows, or sections to rearrange them on your page. This makes moving items on your page much easier than dragging sections around in the Visual Builder.\n\nDragging a Layer Into Visual Builder\n\nYou can add a layer into your page by dragging many different file types into the Visual Builder from your desktop. Text files, images, custom code, video, and audio import with ease. When your files are imported, Divi will automatically create a section at the bottom of your page and assign it to the appropriate module within a section. To learn more about Divi’s drag and drop file upload, refer to our written documentation.\n\nUsing the Filter Option\n\nThe Divi layers view panel offers the ability to filter contents on your Divi pages. This is useful when needing to locate a specific module or element, especially on pages with lots of content. To use the layers filter option, simply click the + filter button to activate the filter field. You can choose to browse available elements, or type your filter criteria into the field provided. Divi will filter all elements on the page to show only the filtered option you choose.\n\nMulti-Select Layers\n\nWhen you need to select more than one layer in the panel, it’s quite easy. To select more than one option, simply hold shift + option (on a Mac) or shift + Ctrl (on PC), then click to select layers that aren’t listed in order on the page. To select layers in succession, hold shift + command (on a Mac) or shift + alt (on PC), then click to select the layers.\n\nRename Elements\n\nTo rename elements in the Divi layers view, simply click into an element, type in the name of your choosing, then hit enter.\n\nSearch Elements\n\nSearching for elements works similarly to the filtering option. However, to search just type in the element that you wish to search for. Divi will display only those layers containing the searched element. For example, a search for text will reveal all text modules on the page.\n\nDeleting, Duplicating, and Adding New Elements\n\nAs with other functions of the layers view, deleting elements is easy. Simply click the trash icon to delete an element or layer. To duplicate an element, click the duplicate icon. Your new element will appear directly beneath. To add a new element, click the + next to an existing element. Alternatively, you can add an element the old fashioned way, by clicking the + icon in the builder. Either way, your new element will appear in the layers view.\n\nTips & Best Practices for Using Layers View\n\nIn order to make best use of Divi’s layers view, there are a few best practices you should follow.\n\nEditing Overlapping Elements\n\nWhen editing complex layouts with overlapping elements, the layers view panel comes in handy. If you’re a seasoned Divi user, you know it can be frustrating to click on a layer that is set to absolute, or one that has negative margins applied. With layers view, editing those elements is a lot easier. Simply activate the panel to select and edit the layer.\n\nRepositioning Rows and Sections\n\nDragging sections and rows around in the Visual Builder can be tedious, and will sometimes cause undesired results. Using the layers view makes dragging and dropping layers throughout your layout easier. Consider using it to reposition your rows and sections. Doing so saves time and is a great way to have ultimate control over your layout.\n\nNaming Your Elements\n\nMost Divi users know how to use admin labels to name their modules. Since the launch of Divi’s Visual Builder, this is no longer the easiest way to go about it. Now thanks to layers view, you can rename your modules and elements with ease. Additionally, naming your elements is an important way to tell elements apart from each other without having to go directly to the element itself.\n\nIn addition to clicking into your section, row, column, or module to give admin labels a name, you can simply click into the layer’s name to change it. However, you should be careful not to double-click the label. If you do, the corresponding section will open."

    "html": "Divi Builder Plugin Documentation\nENTER SEARCH TERM\nDIVI\nEXTRA\nBLOOM\nMONARCH\nDIVI BUILDER\nDEVELOPERS\nBACK TO DIVI BUILDER PLUGIN DOCUMENTATION\nUsing The Divi Role Editor\n\nLimit what certain WordPress user roles can do within the Divi Builder.\n\nThe Divi Role Editor is a powerful group of settings that allow you to limit the types of actions of users on your website. In this documentation, we’ll go over what the role editor is, how to access it, and how to use it. Let’s dive in!\n\nWhat is the Divi Role Editor?\n\nUsing the Divi Role Editor, you can limit the types of actions that can be taken by WordPress users of different roles. This is a great way to limit the functionality available to your customers or guest authors to ensure that they only have the necessary options available to them.\n\nFor each role, you can disable certain actions within the Divi Builder, which will limit how the builder can be used for users of that role.\n\nThis is the perfect way for WordPress freelancers and smaller web design agencies to hand off websites to their clients, while at the same time limiting what the client can do within Divi. By limiting more advanced features, you can make the Divi Builder easier for them to understand, while at the same time preventing them from accessing features that may be used to ruin your beautiful designs!\n\nDivi Role Editor Case Use Example\n\nHere is a great example. Let’s say you just finished building a new Divi website for your client and you’re ready to hand it off. Everything looks perfect and you want to ensure that your client doesn’t change certain design elements, settings, or functionalities of the website that are important for it to continue working well.\n\nHowever, you want them to be able to make certain updates like for example, the text on their About Us page. This is the perfect opportunity to use the Divi Role Editor.\n\nThe first step is to make their user account have the role of “Editor”. You can do that by going to Users > Edit Users > Role > Editor.\n\nNext, we’ll navigate to the Divi Role Editor and click on the Editor tab. This will allow us to toggle on and off access to certain functionality and settings that Editors can have.\n\nIn this scenario, we only want to let our clients edit the text and images of the About Us page, but not anything to do with advanced settings or the layout of the page. So we’re going to toggle a few things off. You can do things like: disable the Divi Library, disable access to global modules, and disable access to Advanced Design Settings and Custom CSS tabs. You might even remove their ability to delete and move modules, and only allow them to edit existing modules.\n\nTake a look at the image below to see the settings I’ve toggled off.\n\nAs you can see in the image above, I’ve disabled settings like being able to do split testing, upload new fonts, edit global items, access advanced settings, edit the layout of a page, and I’ve also removed access to Portability options. When you’re doing configuring the Editor’s role, your client now has only the tools they need to edit their content without risking messing up the layout or advanced settings by accident.\n\nHow to Access the Divi Role Editor\n\nTo access the Divi Role Editor navigate to your WordPress Dashboard. On the sidebar hover over Divi and click Role Editor.\n\nDivi Role Editor Settings and Options Explained\n\nNow let’s do a deep dive into the Role Editor settings and options within the Divi Role Editor.\n\nDivi Role Editor Dashboard\n\nLet’s take a quick tour of the Role Editor Dashboard.\n\nSave Divi Roles – Click this button to save your changes.\nRole Types – This is the Role Type bar. Click through each tab to configure the settings for each role type.\nPortability – Click this icon to import or export role editor settings.\nUndo – Click this icon to undo recent changes.\nAll Icon – Click this icon to enable or disable all of the options in that Settings Group on or off.\n\nUnderstanding User Roles\n\nWhen you first click into the Role Editor, a dashboard will appear with tabs at the top listing the different types of roles available on your website like Administrator, Editor, Author, Contributor, and Shop Manager. Clicking on each tab will allow you to configure the settings and accessibility of that role. Within each role tab you’ll be able to edit general options, builder interface options, library settings, settings tabs, settings types, modules use, support center, and portability.\n\nAdministrator\n\nGranting administrator access will give someone access to all the administration features within your site. This is a top-level role and should only be granted with care. Typically, all of the options are enabled for the admin so they can have complete access to your website.\n\nEditor\n\nThe Editor role is typically reserved for users who need the ability to write, edit, publish and manage blog posts, including posts created by other users.\n\nAuthor\n\nA user with author access is able to publish and manage their own blog posts. They won’t be able to edit or manage posts made by others.\n\nContributor\n\nUsers with contributor access mean they can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them live. They also cannot access or edit others’ posts.\n\nShop Manager\n\nThe Shop Manager role is a role you can give someone to manage the shop without making them a WordPress admin. They will have WordPress editor capabilities. They’ll have all the rights a customer has and will also be able to manage all settings within WoCommerce like creating and editing products, etc. This also gives them access to all WooCommerce reports.\n\nDivi Theme Privileges\n\nHere you can adjust the highest-level theme settings, which will grant access or limit access to the core Divi functionalities: the Divi Library, Split Testing, Page Options, and Portability.\n\nBuilder Interface\n\nHere you can limit high-level actions within the builder, such as the ability to edit, delete or move items within the builder. A common implementation of these settings may be to enable the editing of items, but disable the ability to move or delete items within the builder. You can also disable access to the Divi Builder altogether.\n\nLibrary Settings\n\nHere you can control the user’s access to the Divi Library. You can also disallow users from editing Global Modules. Since changes made to global modules often have far-reaching implications, it’s sometimes safer not to allow your clients to edit them at all.\n\nSettings Tabs\n\nSettings tabs refer to the three categories of options available within the settings box of every module, row and section. These settings tabs are: General Settings, Advanced Design Settings, and Custom CSS. Generally speaking, everything you need to build an awesome Divi website can be found in the General Settings, but if you want to get a little more advanced then you can move on to the Design Setting and Custom CSS tabs. Often times it’s a good idea to disable these latter tabs for your clients.\n\nSettings Types\n\nIn addition to being able to disable entire settings tabs, you can also control the types of settings available within those tabs. This gives you even more fined tuned control over what your clients can edit. For example, you might want to only allow your clients to control the Text content of modules, but stop them from adjusting colors and layout options.\n\nModule Use\n\nFinally, you can also disable the use of entire modules. When a module is disabled for a user, they will be unable to edit modules of that type or add new modules of that type to the page. For example, you may want to disable every mode except for the Text and Image modules if you really want to keep things streamlined for your clients.\n\nSupport Center\n\nGrant or limit access to the Divi Support Center. You can determine if a role has the ability to contact support, grant remote access to the Element Themes support team, access Divi documentation, put the website in safe mode, and more.\n\nPortability\n\nThis section grants or limits access to the elements a role can export from your website and import to your website.\n\nBest Tips and Practices For Using The Divi Role Editor\n\nWhen using the Divi Role Editor, keep these best practices in mind.\n\nUnderstand User Roles\n\nBefore you go about setting the Divi Role Editor settings, it’s important to understand user roles in WordPress. You don’t want to risk giving one user type too much access to important structural elements and advanced settings on your website when they are just there to write blog posts. Simplifying access to certain user types simplifies things for your client by giving them a less overwhelming CMS to navigate.\n\nTest Out Priviledges\n\nSometimes when we’re setting these rules we’re not aware of the real-life impact they will have. We recommend logging in to your website as different user types to see how these configurations take effect in real-time.\n\nContinue Learning\n\nContinue your journey to mastering Divi by checking out other Divi documentation!\n\nLearn The Divi Basics\nBrowse More Divi Documentation\nMore Resources\n\nWant to learn more?

    "html": "Divi Builder Plugin Documentation\nENTER SEARCH TERM\nDIVI\nEXTRA\nBLOOM\nMONARCH\nDIVI BUILDER\nDEVELOPERS\nBACK TO DIVI BUILDER PLUGIN DOCUMENTATION\nUsing the Divi Multi-Select and Bulk Editing Features\n\nSelect multiple elements at once and make bulk edits with ease.\n\nThe Divi multi-select and bulk editing feature is a powerful tool that enables you to build WordPress websites faster and more efficiently than ever before. Multiple elements can be selected at the same time allowing you to make edits to several modules, rows, or sections at once. You can drag, drop, copy, paste, delete and edit your website’s content making changes fast and easy. You no longer have to spend excessive time editing modules or sections one by one.\n\nThe Power of Divi Multi-Select and Bulk Editing Features\n\nDivi makes editing large amounts of content a breeze with the multi-select and bulk edit feature. For instance, rebranding a website can be a tedious task if you have to edit each module individually just to change a color. For example, you can select multiple modules where background colors are used to change them at once. Another example of how multi-selecting and editing modules can save you time is when you want to add animation or scrolling effects.\n\nSelecting Multiple Modules\n\nWhen using the Divi Visual Builder, hold down the Command (Mac OSX) or Ctrl (PC) key, then click on multiple elements to select them. You can select as many modules as you’d like.\n\nAnother way to multi-select elements is to hold down the Shift key then click to select a number of modules in a column, several rows in a section, or several sections in a page. Once selected, you can bulk edit all of the items simultaneously. Selected items are highlighted with a gray box around them.\n\nBulk Editing Modules\n\nYou can multi-select any number of modules to edit them at once. Simply press and hold the Command (Mac OSX) or Ctrl (PC) key, then select the number of modules you wish to edit. Additionally, you can select modules across rows, or even sections. For example, you can select button modules to change the text color as well as background color.\n\nDivi Multi-Select and Bulk Editing Shared Settings\n\nWhen using the Divi multi-select and bulk editing feature, it’s a good idea to stick with modules that are the same. For example, editing multiple buttons is a great way to edit modules at once. When editing similar modules, all of the design settings will be visible, making it easy to alter any design aspect of the modules.\n\nHowever, if you try to bulk edit different modules, such as images, blurbs, and buttons at the same time, options are limited. You’ll only be able to see options such as filters, spacing, animations, and a few others. You won’t be able to edit colors, text, or backgrounds. This can be confusing and will limit your editing capabilities.\n\nCopy, Paste & Delete with Divi Multi-Select and Bulk Editing\n\nThere will be times when you’ll need to copy and paste modules or elements within your Divi pages at the same time. This is easily done with the multi-select and bulk editing feature. Simply click and hold Command (Mac OSX) or Ctrl (PC) to select your items. Once you’ve made your selections, right-click on any element selected and click copy modules.\n\nTo paste elements that you’ve copied, simply right-click where you’d like your items to be placed, then hover over the add module icon. Next, right-click and select paste modules.\n\nYou can also easily delete multiple elements at once. Just click on the trash icon to erase multiple modules at once.\n\nMove Elements with Multi-Select\n\nDivi makes it easy to multi-select elements and move them around your pages. Simply multi-select your items, then drag them to place them elsewhere on the page.\n\nTips and Best Practices for Divi Multi-Select and Bulk Editing\n\nYou can take advantage of this robust feature of Divi by incorporating a few best practices when building or editing pages within Divi.\n\nAdding Effects Are a Breeze\n\nThe Divi multi-select and bulk editing feature makes it easy to add different effects to several modules at once. It’s a great way to speed up the design process, as well as streamline quality assurance. By using this handy feature, there’s no need to make changes individually when selecting similar modules.\n\nUse Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nHolding down the Command or Ctrl keys is a quick and easy way to get to know your page structure. When you hold down Command or Ctrl, you get an outline of all modules, rows, and sections, giving you a better understanding of how all the elements fit together.\n\nMove Elements From Multiple Sections Into One With Efficiency\n\nMulti-selecting items to move them from multiple sections into one is much faster and easier than the traditional way. You’ll save time (and likely some frustration) when you want to re-organize your page to streamline a design.\n\nUse the Layers View\n\nYou can utilize the Divi multi-select and bulk editing feature to make changes faster and more efficiently, especially when working in complex layouts. For example, elements that use transform controls or negative margins can be tricky to click on. So, the layers view panel comes in handy in those instances. To learn more about Divi’s layers view, refer to our written documentation.\n\nDrag and Drop Elements From Other Pages\n\nConsider using Divi’s multi-select feature when wanting to incorporate elements from other pages. You can open the source page in a new browser window to drag elements from the page into a new page in a separate window. This is a great way to speed up the design process without having to save elements to your library for reuse.\n\nIncorporate Divi Multi-Select and Bulk Editing Early\n\nLastly, incorporate multi-select and bulk-editing into the initial design process. When creating new websites, there can be a lot of trial and error before you get to the final product. Once you settle on a design, you can use multi-select and bulk editing to make those final design choices to make the switch faster and easier.\n\nAdditional Resources For the Divi Multi-Select and Bulk Editing Feature\n\nConsider practicing using Divi’s multi-select and bulk editing feature by following a few design tutorials found on our blog. They incorporate using this feature and will help you get familiar with how it works. This will make you more confident and efficient using Divi.\n\nHow to Add Scroll-Animated Icons to Section Backgrounds in Divi\nHow to Create a WooCommerce Checkout Page Template with Divi\nHow to Create Member-Exclusive Blog Posts with Divi’s Condition Options"

All without having to leave the visual builder!\n\nThanks to the Divi responsive preview system, it’s no longer necessary to use a third party software to test how your webpages will render on smaller screen sizes. Mobile devices are utilized by more than 60% of all internet users, so previewing how your pages will look on smaller screens is an important part of web design. Let’s take a look at how to use the repsponsive preview system by demonstrating its capabilities using the Streamer Divi Layout Pack.\n\nHow To Access the Divi Responsive Preview System\n\nThere are two ways to access Divi’s responsive preview system. The first is by activating it at the page level. This can be accomplished by viewing the page’s back end or on the front end with the Visual Builder. The second way to activate the responsive preview system is at the module, colum, row, or section level. Let’s start off by loading the preview system at the page level.\n\nPage Level Responsive Preview Mode\n\nTo use the reponsive preview system, log in to your Divi website and click Enable Visual Builder.\n\nWith the Visual Builder activated, click the purple ellipsis menu at the bottom center of your screen to activate the page options menu.\n\nNext, click the tablet or phone icon at the bottom left corner of your screen to activate the responsive preview system.\n\nModule Level Responsive Preview Mode\n\nThe Divi responsive preview system can be accessed in any module, column, row, or section throughout the Visual Builder. For example, click into a text module in the Visual Builder. Click on the design tab, then scroll down to view the heading font settings. Hover over heading font to reveal the responsive view menu. Next, click the tablet or phone icon to enable the respective view.\n\nAdjusting the Divi Responsive Preview Modes\n\nThere are multiple presets available within the responsive preview system. The default preview modes are desktop view, tablet view, and mobile view. To access them, click the responsive preview menu in the lower left corner of the Visual Builder.\n\nDivi Responsive Preview on Popular Device Presets\n\nThere are also popular device presets available to you. These presets enable you to preview how your page will display based on a specific device. To access the list of devices, click on the first dropdown menu.\n\nFrom there, you’ll be able to choose from a list that includes several Apple and Android devices.\n\nCustomizing the Divi Responsive Preview Widths\n\nIn addition to default and device preview presets, you can specify a custom width for your preview. Furthermore, Divi has a click and drag resizing function that will allow you to adjust the width of your preview with ease.\n\nDrag To Resize the Divi Responsive Preview\n\nTo resize your preview, simply click and drag from the left hand side of the preview. As you drag the preview area, the width will automatically adjust in the dimension fields.\n\nCustom Size Input\n\nAn additional way to customize your responsive preview is to manually adjust the width and height to a specific dimension. To do this, simply click into the dimension field and type in your desired width. Once you have adjusted the size to your liking, you can click the make default phone view button to make it the default preview width. If you’d like to set dimensions for the tablet preview as well, repeat the steps outlined to create a default view for tablets. Then, click the make default tablet view button to save your preset.\n\nAbove The Fold Indicator\n\nThe Divi responsive preview system has a handy above the fold indicator that enables you to determine how the elements on your page will be visible to your website’s visitors before scrolling. This is useful when you are placing important content at the top of your design. The above the fold indicator will change based on the device preset that you choose.\n\nPortrait & Landscape Modes\n\nAnother excellent feature of the Divi responsive preview system is the ability to view your designs in either portrait or landscape mode. To access this feature, click the icon to the right of the dimension fields. Clicking the icon will switch the page orientation, enabling you to view how your page will look based on how the user is holding the device. The current orientation is indicated by the darker color.\n\nMore Resources\n\nThe Divi responsive preview system enables Divi users to preview their designs on smaller device screens quickly and effortlessly.

Want to adjust the size or spacing of text or an element of your website at the click of a button? The Customizer is where you want to start! To customizer panels can be accessed via the Divi > Theme Customizer and Divi > Module Customizer links in your WordPress Dashboard. The Theme Customizer gives you control over site-wide theme elements, such as your menu & logo size or your body and header text styles. The Module Customizer gives you size & font controls over individual modules. Do you want to reduce the height of all the slider modules on your website? That can be done in just a few seconds via the Module Customizer! Let’s take a closer look.\n\nExploring The Theme Customizer\n\nFirst we will explore the Theme Customizer. There are hundreds of options here, separated into different categories. When you first open up the customizer you will see several panels, such as “Header & Navigation” and “General Settings.” Opening these panels will reveal the options related to those areas of your website. As you adjust the settings within the customizer, you will be given a live preview of their effects. Once you save your changes, the new styles will be reflected on your live website.\n\nYou can do just about anything with the Theme Customizer without ever touching a line of code. For a more detailed look at some of the different customizer options, and some creative ways to use these options together, be sure to watch the instructional video above.\n\nExploring The Module Customizer\n\nThe Module Customizer works just like the Theme Customizer, except it focuses on the customization of individual modules as opposed to general website elements. When you open up the Module Customizer, you will see a separate panel for each of the Divi modules. Opening up these panels will reveal customizer controls that can be used to adjust the spacing and typography of each module on your entire website. For example, if you think that the FullWidth Slider titles are too large, you can simply open up the Fullwidth Slider panel and adjust the Header Size slider. Now whenever you add a new Fullwidth Slider to a page, the customized header size will be reflected. No need to use a Child Theme or adjust the Advanced Module settings for the individual module. The Module Customizer is a collection of global module controls."

Here you can store your favorite layouts, sections, rows or modules for later use. Whenever you save an item to your Divi Library, you can access it easily from within the module window when adding a new layout, module, section or row to the page.\n\nSave yourself hours of design time by creating collections of your favorite module combinations. Did you spend hours customizing the Design and Advanced tabs of a module to create a completely unique look for your new website? Why not save all of those customized modules to your Library so that you can use them in the future without having to re-create them! Once you have created your collection of library items, you will find that starting to build new websites will become infinitely easier. In fact, you may never need to create a Child Theme again! Once you have developed a stellar library of custom modules, rows and sections, you can export these items and import them when creating new websites to speed up your design process.\n\nThe Divi Library is more than just a collection of saved layouts. Each library item can also be made “Global.” Global modules are synced and mirrored wherever they are placed. Whenever a Global module is altered, it updates automatically on all of the pages you have added it to! In this sense, Divi becomes more than just a page builder, it becomes a website builder. For example, you could create a Global section that is added to the footer of every page on your site. Update that Global Section once and have the footer of your entire website updated instantly.Modules in the library can also have their settings selectively synced. For example, if you have customized a module heavily using the Design and Advanced tabs, you can save the module to the library while only saving the settings in these two areas. If his module is made Global, your Design and Advanced settings will be synced, but everything in the Content tab can be different on each page the module is used on.\n\nSaving New Items To The Library\n\nWith Divi’s Visual Builder, whenever you hover over a module, row or section in the Divi Builder, the menu bar includes a button to save the item to the library for later use. Simply click the icon, give your template a name and click “Save to Library”.\n\nOnce it is added to the library, you can access the item at any time via the Divi > Divi Library link in your WordPress Dashboard, and you can add the saved item to a new page via the “Add From Library” tab when adding a new module, row or section to your page.\n\nOnce you click “Save & Add To Library” you will be asked to fill out some information about your new library item. You can give your new item a name to remember it by, choose which settings you would like to save, add your item to a category, as well as make the item a “global library” item. For more information about global items, be sure to read our global modules tutorial. We also have a great tutorial that talks about how to use the selective sync feature. Once you have filled out all of the necessary information, click “Save” to complete the process and add your new item to the library.\n\nCreating & Managing Items In The Library\n\nWhenever you add a new item to your library, this item can be managed and edited from within the Divi > Divi Library page in your WordPress Dashboard. When accessing this page you will get a list of all of your library items. You can sort your list via the controls at the top of the page, and you can edit any of your library items by clicking the “edit” link next to the item in the list. We just went over how to add an item to the library while you are using the Divi Builder. You can also build new items from scratch from inside of the Divi Library. Once you build a new library item, it will be available in the “Add From Library” tab while using the Divi Builder. To create a new item in the library, click the “Add New” button at the top of the screen while inside the Divi > Divi Library page in your WordPress Dashboard.\n\nAdding Library Items To Your Page\n\nOnce an item has been added to your Divi Library, it can be quickly accessed when building new pages. Whenever you add a new Module, Row or Layout to your page, you will notice an “Add From Library” tab. Clicking this tab will reveal all of the items in your library. Click on the item that you would like to add to your page."

    "html": "Divi Theme Documentation\nENTER SEARCH TERM\nDIVI\nEXTRA\nBLOOM\nMONARCH\nDIVI BUILDER\nDEVELOPERS\nBACK TO DIVI THEME DOCUMENTATION\nUsing the Divi Support Center\n\nThe Divi Support Center gives you and our support team the tools they need to fix problems more quickly and efficiently, without disrupting your website.\n\nThe Divi Support Center is designed to bring all of the elements of great support into one interface. Fully automated system status reports, in-depth documentation, safe mode, a debug log, and even seamless remote access for support agents.\n\nHow to Access the Divi Help & Support Center\n\nAccessing the Divi Support Center is a breeze. Simply log in to your Divi website, then navigate to Divi > Support.\n\nWithin the Support Center, there are several options to take advantage of including:\n\nSystem Status\nRemote Access\nDivi Documentation & Help\nSafe Mode\nLogs\n\nLet’s take an in-depth look at how to use each feature of the Support Center.\n\nDivi Support Center: System Status\n\nThe first option in the support center is the System Status section. You’ll be able to view information on your system’s configuration and identify any problems that may have occurred since your last login. PHP, CSS, javascript, and WordPress core files are monitored in this section. Divi uses a stoplight system — green, yellow, or red — to indicate issues that may be of concern.\n\nIf your lights are green, there are no detectible issues so you are good to go.\nYellow lights indicate a potential issue that you should consider fixing in the near future.\nIf you have red lights, it’s time to take a look at issues and fix them right away.\n\nUnder System Status, there are two interactions available including the Show Full Report and Copy Full Report links. When the first link is clicked, your system’s information is displayed to reveal any issues that may exist. The second link will allow you to copy your system report to provide to a member of Elegant Theme’s support staff, should they request it.\n\nCommon Issues\n\nIn the system status section, there are several common issues that may arise prompting a yellow or red status. For example, there could be a PHP error such as your system’s memory limit being set too low. If your version of PHP is outdated and requires updating, it would be indicated here. Additional issues for CSS, javascript, or errors with WordPress core files would appear in the system status section.\n\nDivi Support Center: Remote Access\n\nRemote Access allows our support staff to troubleshoot problems on your website. With the click of a toggle, you can grant access to your WordPress and Divi installation in order for us to solve any problems. When Remote Access is enabled, a secure token is sent to the Elegant Themes support team instantly. This token sends secure login credentials that they can use to log into your site, then run through their support protocols to identify and correct any problem you are facing.\n\nOnce activated, our team will have up to 4 days of access to your site. Additionally, you can enable Full Admin Access for our staff, should they request it, just by the click of a toggle. Remote Access will automatically get disabled after 4 days. That being said, you can disable it at your convenience, anytime.\n\nIt’s important to note that only you can enable remote access.\n\nRemote Access is a fantastic feature that saves a ton of time when you need it the most. Troubleshooting problems with WordPress don’t happen often, but if they do, you can rest assured that the Elegant Themes support team is there for you.\n\nEnabling Remote Access\n\nSimply toggle Remote Access on when you need a little extra help. At that point, another option will appear asking if you’d like to grant Admin Access. If our team requests access, click to toggle it on. It’s that easy.\n\nDivi Support Center: Documentation\n\nDivi Documentation is extensive and is available directly within Divi’s Support Center. If you need to brush up on your Divi skills, or simply don’t know how to use a module, our documentation has your back. Our documentation includes handly step-by-step guides, videos, and thorough overviews of our modules, as well as Divi features such as Theme Builder and Visual Builder. You can click on the View Full Divi Documentation link to visit our full library of articles at your disposal.\n\nSafe Mode\n\nThe next section in Divi’s Support Center is Safe Mode. As you may know, WordPress is an open-source platform, so naturally, there will be times when problems can arise. With all of the plugins and themes available by third-party vendors, there can be compatibility issues. Problems may occur, whether it’s a plugin that hasn’t been updated to work with the latest version of WordPress, or customizations you recently implemented. Safe Mode enables you to disable your third-party plugins, along with child themes or custom code so that you can troubleshoot your problem. The best part of Safe Mode is that these things are only disabled for you. Your site’s visitors will continue to view your website as if nothing is wrong.\n\nEnabling Safe Mode\n\nSafe Mode can be enabled with one click. Either you or a member of the Elegant Themes support staff can enable it. Simply click the toggle to enable this feature so you can begin the troubleshooting process. You can browse your WordPress core files and Divi theme files to determine what the problem is. If you find an issue but don’t feel comfortable addressing it yourself, you can enable Remote Access so that our experienced support team can take over and save the day.\n\nCommon Issues\n\nThere are a few common reasons to enable Safe Mode. First is when third-party plugins are being used. As previously mentioned, WordPress is an open-source platform. Because of this, there are hundreds of developers who create plugins for WordPress. There are times when a plugin may need to be updated to be compatible with the latest version of WordPress. Running outdated versions of your plugins can sometimes cause issues or break your website.\n\nAnother common issue is when WordPress child themes are being used. Child themes are quite useful for adding custom code to your site so you don’t have to alter the parent theme. Sometimes errors can occur during the creation process. This can cause a variety of issues including the white screen of death (WSOD). Safe Mode will disable any child theme you have installed so that your site becomes functional again, allowing you to determine the cause of the problem.\n\nFinally, added custom CSS or javascript can cause conflicts. While adding custom code is typically a great way to add new features, there are times when your code can break your site. It can be something as simple as a missing semi-colon that throws your site into a tailspin. Thankfully, Divi’s Safe Mode option will disable any code you have installed, restoring functionality to your site.\n\nDivi Debug Log\n\nIf you have debugging enabled in your WordPress install, you will be able to view your debug log right from the Divi Support Center in theme options. If not, you’ll need to take steps to enable it.\n\nTo enable debugging, you’ll need to either use a plugin or alter your theme’s wp-config.php file. To learn more on how to do this, please visit our blog and refer to our Ultimate Guide to WordPress Recovery Mode post to learn how to enable debugging.\n\nMore Resources\n\nThe Divi Support Center offers a great way to troubleshoot problems with your site. Whether you need to enable safe mode, debug system errors, or check the system’s status, Support Center has you covered. If you would like to learn more about how to fix common WordPress errors, check out some of our helpful posts on the Elegant Themes blog.\n\nThe Ultimate Guide to WordPress Recovery Mode\nHow to Fix the WordPress White Screen of Death"

With Divi, you can build stunning websites from the ground up without touching a single line of code (unless you want to!). Divi harnesses the power of complex web development and lets you design custom websites by using the Divi Visual Builder so you can see the changes you are making in real time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW A DEMO\n\nAll Divi Builder Settings and Features Explained\n\nLet’s explore all of the features, settings, and functionality available within the Divi Visual Builder.\n\nHow To Load The Visual Builder\n\nOnce you have Divi installed on your website, you’ll be able to access the Visual Builder on every page of your website. To do so, navigate to any page and click “Enable Visual Builder” on the top admin bar.\n\nCreating a New Page and Enabling the Visual Builder\n\nTo start fresh on a blank page, navigate to your WordPress dashboard and click Page > Add New.\n\nGive your page a title, then click “Use Divi Builder”. This will re-load the page onto the front end of the website with the Divi Visual Builder enabled.\n\nAs your page reloads, you’ll notice three options that come up: Build From Scratch, Choose A Premade Layout, and Clone An Existing Page.\n\nBuild From Scratch\n\nThis option loads the Divi Builder with a blank page design. Choose this option if you’d like to start your page design from scratch.\n\nChoose a Premade Layout\n\nIf you’d like to start your design with one of your saved layouts or a premade layout pack from Divi, choose this option. It will load the Divi Library where you can browse premade layout packs, your previously saved designs, and existing pages on your website.\n\nClone an Existing Page\n\nYou can also start your design by cloning an existing page on your website. Select this option if you’d like to load a page design from an existing page on your website as your starting point.\n\nSelect, Build From Scratch.\n\nBy default, a standard section is automatically added to the page.\n\nDivi Visual Builder Basics\n\nLet’s start with the basics. The building blocks of Divi. The main building blocks of Divi are sections, rows, columns, and modules. Sections contain rows, which contain columns, which contain modules.\n\nSections\n\nIn Divi, everything you build starts with a section. Sections are the biggest building block in the Divi builder. You can think of them as horizontal stacking blocks that can group your content into visually distinguishable areas. This content wrapper has various settings that can be used to do some really awesome things.\n\nThere are three types of sections: Standard, Fullwidth, and Specialty.\n\nStandard Sections\n\nStandard sections are the most commonly used section within Divi. It expands to the width of the browser and contains a row that is set to 80% width by default. However, there is a lot of customization options available within the standard section to get it to do whatever you want.\n\nFullwidth Sections\n\nFullwidth sections give you access to a set of Fullwidth Modules. These modules act a little differently because they take advantage of the full width of the browser. Fullwidth modules can only be placed within Fullwidth sections.\n\nSpecialty Sections\n\nSpecialty sections allow for more advanced column structures. When you select “Specialty” you’ll see all the available column structures available.\n\nUnlike normal sections, when you use a specialty section, you can add complex column variations next to full-spanning vertical sidebars, without adding unwanted breaks to the page. These types of layouts are not possible using normal sections. Below is an example of a Speciality Section in action.\n\nRows\n\nRows are nested inside sections and can contain a variety of column layouts that help structure your content. Learn More: A Complete Overview of Divi Rows & Columns\n\nColumns\n\nColumns are nested inside rows and create a basic boxed structure for your content. Every row has a column, even if it’s just one column.\n\nLearn More: A Complete Overview of Divi Rows & Columns\n\nModules\n\nModules are the content blocks of Divi. So Contact Forms, Images, Text, Sliers, Blurbs and more are all examples of modules. Check out all the modules Divi has to offer here. To learn how to use the modules check out our Module Documentation.\n\nParent / Child Element Hierarchy in Divi Builder Elements\n\nWhen adjusting settings and applying styles in Divi it’s important to remember the hierarchy of Divi’s sections, rows, columns, and modules. Sections contain rows, rows contain columns, and columns contain modules. These are called parent and child elements. Child elements are nested inside parent elements and are affected by any design styling you apply to the parent element.\n\nThe Element Settings Window Pop-Up\n\nWhenever you open an element’s settings, a window will pop up with all of the content, design, and advanced settings available to that element. Let’s take a closer look at what’s available.\n\nName of the Element\n\nAt the top left you’ll see the name of the builder element you’re working on. That could be a section, row, column, module, page settings, etc. If you ever get confused about what element you’re currently editing, look here and it will tell you!\n\nPresets\n\nUnderneath the name of the module is where you can access Global Presets. Click on the dropdown to load a saved preset, create a new preset, or delete a preset. Presets are pre-designed and saved settings for any section, row, column, or module within Divi. Learn all about Global Presets here.\n\nExpand Modal\n\nThe next icon expands the modal to the width of your browser.\n\nSnap or Separate Modal\n\nThe next icon either snaps or separates the modal. Snap affixes the modal to the left of your browser window and does not hover over your page’s content, but adjusts next to it. To exit the left sidebar position of the snapped modal, click the icon again and it will separate and return to the position it was before.\n\nOther Settings\n\nWhen clicked, the three vertical ellipses icon gives you access to even more settings for that element.\n\nSave To Libray – Saves this element to your library.\n\nSave To Divi Cloud – Saves this element to your Divi Cloud.\n\nSplit Test – Conduct a split test with this modal. Learn how to split test here.\n\nDisable – Quickly disable the element on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device. When an icon is green that means it’s visible. When it’s red, it’s hidden.a\n\nLock – Locks the element so no design styles and settings are changed. To unlock, right-click on the element and click “Unlock”.\n\nCopy Module – Copies the module to your clipboard so you can paste it anywhere on the page.\nCopy Module Styles – Copies the module’s styles and settings so you can apply them to another same module.\n\nPaste Button One Styles – Pastes styles from the button. This will only take effect if you have copied the styles first by clicking the above option “Copy Module Styles”.\n\nReset Module Styles – Resets the module’s styles to the default styling. This removes any customization you did to the module.\n\nPaste Module – After you’ve copied the module, click this to paste the module anywhere on your website. For this to work, you must first click “Copy Module”.\n\nView Modified Styles – Selecting this option will only display the settings of that module that have been modified. This is helpful when you’ve made a lot of changes or you’ve forgotten which changes you’ve made because it quickly shows the settings that have been modified within that module allowing you to make fast updates.\n\nExtend Button Styles – When extending a module’s styles you have the option to extend those styles throughout the entire page including headers and footers, just the page design, just the section, just the row, or just the column that module is in.\n\nApply Styles To Active Preset –\n\nEdit Preset Style – Selecting this option will allow you to access the current preset’s settings and stylings.\n\nGo To Layer – Once clicked, the Layers panel will open up and go to the layer that the design element is in. This is helpful to quickly access builder elements to access their settings, rearrange them, and more.\n\n\nYou can also access these settings by right-clicking on the design element you’re working on. When right-clicking to access these settings, you’ll notice Undo and Redo are added at the top of the list. This is handy for when you want to quickly undo or redo a certain action.\n\nSearch Options Bar\n\nNext in the module window is the Search Bar. You can use the search back to quickly find and access settings and styles. Simply type what you’re looking for to search.\n\n+ Filter\n\nThe filter button works similarly to the search function in that it allows you to quickly access modified styles, responsive styles, hover state styles, and active content.\n\nTabs: Content, Design, Advanced.\n\nAll modal windows have three tabs: Content, Design, and Advanced. This is where the content settings, design settings, and advanced settings are for any Divi Builder element you’re working on (whether that be a section, row, columnn, or module).\n\nContent\n\nThe Content tab is where you can adjust the content settings of the Divi Builder element you’re working on. What’s in the Content tab varies depending on which element you are working on.\n\nDesign\n\nThe Design tab is where you can adjust the design settings for the Divi Builder element you are working on.\n\nAdvanced\n\nThe Advanced tab is where you can access the advanced settings for whatever Divi Builder element you’re working on. Settings like Custom CSS, Visibility, Scroll Effects, Conditions, and more.\n\nBottom Buttons: Exit, Undo, Redo, Save.\n\nAt the bottom of the modal window, you’ll see 4 buttons from left to right: Exit (red), Undo (purple), Redo (blue), and Save (green).\n\nExit – If you exit the modal window without saving your changes first, they will be lost.\nUndo – Undoes previous actions.\nRedo – Redoes undone actions.\nSave – Click this button to save your settings.\n\nTour the Divi Visual Builder\n\nIn this section, we’ll review the interface of the Divi Visual Builder and explain what each option does.\n\nBottom Divi Toolbar\n\nThe bottom toolbar is where you can access a variety of settings. Let’s look at what each of these icons means.\n\nLeftside of the Toolbar\n\nWe’ll start from the left, and work our way to the right side of the Divi toolbar.\n\nThree Dots: Builder Settings\n\nClick the three docs to access settings that customize the Divi Builder interface. Here you can customize what icons are on the bottom toolbar, the Builder default view mode, the modal default position, and more.\n\nCustomize Builder Settings Toolbar\n\nHere you can choose to show or hide icons on the toolbar for quick access. Simply click the icon to show or hide it on the toolbar.\n\n\nFrom left to right the icons are:\nWireframe View – Click to view the wireframe layout of the page you are working on.\n\nZoom in / Zoom Out – Click this icon to zoom in or out on your page design.\n\nDesktop View – Click this to realize the Builder window to the size of a Desktop computer.\nTablet View – Click this to realize the Builder window to the size of tablet devices.\nMobile View – Click this to realize the Builder window to the size of mobile devices.\n\nHover Mode – When the hover mode is one, the element settings toolbar shows on hover, rather than on-click.\nClick Mode – When the click mode is on, the element settings toolbar will show on-click, rather than on-hover.\nGrid Mode – When gride mode is on, all of the element settings toolbars and containers will be visible without having to hover or click on them.\n\nHistory State Interval\n\nThe History State Interval determines how often Divi auto-saves your page design. You can choose it to auto-save after every action you take, or every 10, 20, 30, or 40 actions.\n\nSettings Modal Default Position\n\nHere you can set the default position of the modal when it’s opened.\n\nYou can choose from Last Used Position, Floating Minimum Size, Fullscreen, Fixed Left Sidebar, Fixed Right Sidebar, or Fixed Bottom Panel.\n\nPage Creation Flow\n\nHere you can choose how new pages are loaded. You can choose for the page to load as a build-from-scratch page, or with the Divi Library window open, by cloning an existing page, or with the three options presented with Give Me a Choice.\n\nBuilder Interface Animations\n\nToggle this option on or off to enable or disable the Divi Builder animations that happen when you click an object.\nimg\n\nShow Disabled Modules at 50% Opacity\n\nToggle this option on to show disabled modules at 50% opacity. Disabled modules are modules that are hidden from view depending on what device is being used (desktop, tablet, or mobile). When you’re working within the Visual Builder, it’s helpful to have disabled modules displayed at 50% opacity so you know they are disabled for the view just by looking at them.\n\nIf this option is toggled off, then the disabled element will not show in the view mode it’s disabled on. For example, below I have the image module disabled on Desktop view and the show disabled modules at 50% opacity setting off. The result is the image is not showing.\n\nGroup Settings Into Closed Toggles\n\nWhen this setting is toggled on it will show module settings as closed toggles. If this setting is toggled off it will show the module settings as open toggles.\n\nAdd Placeholder Content to New Modules\n\nThis option allows you to choose whether or not you want modules to display placeholder content when you add them to your page. If you toggle this option off, new modules added to your page will not display placeholder content, as shown below.\n\nTheme Builder Template Editing\n\nThis setting allows you to choose whether or not you’d like to be able to edit Theme Builder templates in the Visual Builder. If you only want those templates to be editable through the dashboard Theme Builder, then toggle this option off.\n\nMiddle Toolbar Section\n\nNow let’s look at the icons in the middle section of the Divi Toolbar.\n\n\nLoad From Library\n\nThe plus icon loads the Divi Library when clicked. Here you have three choices: Premade Layouts, Your Saved Layouts, or Clone an Existing Page.\n\nPremade Layouts\nDivi comes packed with hundreds of free Layout Packs designed by our in-house design team just for you! If you’d like to use a pre-made layout on your page, click the Premade Layouts tab at the top of the Divi Library window and browse through the hundreds of available designs. You can even use the sidebar on the left to filter through categories or the search bar to find what you’re looking for.\n\nLearn More: How to Use a Premade Layout Pack on Your Divi Website.\n\nYour Saved Lyouts\nIn this section, you can load any layouts you have saved to your library and from your Divi Cloud. Click the “Your Saved Layouts” tab to view your saved layouts and use the sidebar options to sort and filter through your saved layouts. One way to use this feature is to create tempalted wireframes that you can save as a layout and then load onto new websites. Make this even easier by saving and loading from Divi Cloud which you can access on any Divi website that’s signed in with your account.\nLearn More: Save and Loading Custom Layouts With Divi Library.\n\nClone Existing Page\nThis feature is handy when you’ve already designed a page layout you like and want to use the same layout on another page. To clone an existing page, click the “Clone Existing Page” tab and navigate to the page you want to clone.\nWhat this does and when/why you’d want to use it.\n\nDownward Arrow – Save to Library\n\nThe downward arrow allows you to save your page layout to your Divi Library and/or your Divi Cloud Library. Once clicked, an options window will pop up where you can name your layout, assign it to certain categories and tags and save it to your Divi Cloud.\n\nLayout Name – Give the layout a name that’s descriptive and memorable. For example, Home Page Light Mode\nSave to Divi Cloud – To save this layout to your Divi Cloud toggle this option on.\nAdd to Categories – Assign a category to this page to keep things organized. Categories that have a blue cloud icon next to them signify that they are Divi Cloud Categories.\nAdd to Tags – Further sort and organize page templates by assigning tags to the page template you’re saving. Ex: Light Mode, Dark Mode, Holiday, Seasonal. You can also create new tags.\nSave to Library – Click this button to save the page template to your library.\n\nTrash Icon – Delete Page Layout\n\nIf you’d like to wipe your page clean and start fresh, simply click the trash can icon to delete the entire page design.\n\nX Icon\n\nThis is the icon that either loads or closes the Divi Toolbar. When the toolbar is open and expand you’ll see an X and when it’s closed you’ll see a + to open and expand it.\n\nGear Icon – Page Settings\n\nThe gear icon brings up the Page Settings window. This is where you can apply custom settings to that page only. These are not global settings, but will only apply to the page you are working on.\n\nPage Content Settings\n\nTitle – This is your Page’s title. You can edit it here or on the backend too.\nExcerpt – This is the excerpt description for the page.\nBackground – You can add\nSplit Testing – You can even do a split test on pages! Learn more about Split Testing here.\n\nPage Design Settings\n\nSpacing – Gutter width is the amount of space in-between columns. The higher the number, the more space. IF you’d like to decrease gutter width spacing, type in a lower number or drag the range slider to the left.\nText – For this page you can set a custom light text color and a custom dark text color.\n\nPage Advanced Settings\n\nCustom CSS – Here you can type custom CSS to apply only to this page.\nPerformance – By default, this option is toggled on. Generating a static CSS file improves the speed and performance of the page by compiling any CSS on the page into minified static CSS files that can be served more efficiently and cached without your visitor’s browser.\nVisibility – Adjust the visibility options on your page here. Learn more about Visibility Options here.\nPosition – The z-index controls the element position on the Z axis. Elements with a higher z-index number will sit atop elements with lower z-index values. Learn more about Position Options here.\n\nClock Icon – Revision History\n\nClick this icon to view the revisions to made to the page. Here you can easily view history states for the page you’re working on and global history states (like eidts to a global footer, header, or module).\n\nTo view the changes you’ve made so far, click on the action toggle.\n\nPortability Icon\n\nClick this icon to Export or Import page layouts. Learn More Here: Importing & Exporting Divi Builder Layouts & Library Collections.\n\nSearch Icon\n\nThe search icon helps you quickly access what you’re looking for. You can change your device view, manage the page layout, access builder settings, search documentation, open elements, and more.

Mastering keyboard shortcuts can help speed up your design process and quick access and edit elements. Learn More: Divi Keyboard Shortcuts.\n\nSave\n\nAnd of course, there is the Save button! A feature you’ll use often. Before exiting the Visual Builder it’s important to save your design. Divi automatically saves your design periodically, but this button is here for instant saves too.\n\nSave Divi Visual Builder Settings\n\nAlways make sure to save your work! The Divi Builder periodically auto-saves your work, however it’s best to do a final manual save before exiting the Visual Builder.\n\nTo save your design you can click the green Save button at th bottom right of the screen, or use the keyboard shortcut cmd + (mac) or ctl + s (PC). Then click “Exit Visual Builder” on the top toolbar to exist the Visual Builder.\n\nDivi Builder Capabilities\n\nLet’s take a look at what you can do with the Divi Builder!\n\nDivi Gives You Complete Design Control\n\nDivi isn’t just a WordPress theme, it’s a complete design framework that allows you to design and customize every part of your website from the ground up. You have control over everything down to the finest detail. Create the perfect websites for you and your clients. Explore all the design features that Divi has to offer!\n\nResponsive Editing\n\nMaking responsive websites is easy with Divi. Divi is responsive by default but takes responsive design a step further by giving you complete control over every design setting on each mobile device. This allows you to perfectly tailor the appearance of each element on computers, tablets and smartphones.\n\nLet’s explore some of the core features that makes Divi, Divi!\n\nEssential Features of the Divi Visual Builder\n\nLet’s take a look at the essential features of Divi’s Visual Builder and what’s available to you at your fingertips.\n\nDesign Visually on the Front End\n\nWith Divi’s Visual Builder, you’re able to drag and drop elements, format text, resize design elements, adjust responsive sizing, and show or hide elements based on the device being used.\n\nThe Theme Builder\n\nDivi’s Theme Builder is a powerful way to build your website templating system using the power of Divis’ Visual Builder to design your website’s header, footer, product templates, blog post templates, category pages, project templates, 404 page, and more.\n\nDrag and Drop to Move and Resize Elements\n\nWith Divi, you’re able to design complex layouts by dragging and dropping elements on the front end. That way you can see how your changes look visually before saving and publishing your design. You can also resize elements on your website by dragging the sides of the elements to adjust settings like height, width, padding, and margins.\n\nCopy and Paste Styles\n\nIn Divi, anything can be copied from one element and pasted onto another. You can copy individual settings, groups of settings or even copy an element’s entire design and transfer it to another element on the page. No need to open up design settings and edit things over and over again. Design it once, and then just copy and paste.\n\nExtendable Stlyes\n\nIf you have a design style that you just created, and you want to use that elsewhere on the page, or even across the entire page, you can simply extend that style automatically to your desired location. Update hundreds of elements at once! Control exactly where and to which elements your styles should be extended to. For example, let’s say you just crafted the perfect button style, but you have dozens of buttons on the page. You can extend that style to the rest of the buttons instantly by extending the style.\n\nKeyboard Shortucts\n\nKeyboard shorcuts are the key to ultimate efficiency. Divi comes with a full range of keyboard shortcuts that advanced users can use to speed up their work flow significantly. Once you get the hang of using shortcuts, you will wonder how you ever lived without them!\n\nMulti-Select & Bulk Editing\n\nIf you want to edit multiple elements at one time like a group of images, then use Divi’s multi-select bulk editing capabilities! To select multiple elements press Cmd or Ctrl and click each element you want to edit on the page at once. You can then edit these elements at the same time, changing their style and content together or moving them to different locations on the page as a group.\n\nFind & Replace Styles\n\nMake sweeping changes across your entire page instantly, saving you hours upon hours of editing time. Using find and replace allows you to change any design value, such as colors or fonts, across the entire page or within specific locations. Instead of opening up each element individually and changing colors over and over again, just find and replace across the entire document.\n\nGlobal Website Styles\n\nCustomize your website with its own overarching design system by editing the default design of any element. When you modify a module’s default design, it updates across your whole website at once. Site-wide theme building plus site-wide design editing is the ultimate combo.\n\nGlobal Website Colors\n\nDivi lets you create a global color palette for your website. These global colors are dynamic and can be changed at any time. This allows you to quickly transform your website’s color scheme in just a few moments.\n\nAdvanced Code Editing\n\nWhile you don’t need to know code to use Divi, you still have the option to write and edit code if you desire! Divi comes with a a fully-featured code editor that makes writing and editing code so much easier and enjoyable. Features include syntax highlighting, error reporting, auto-complete, color picking, multi-line select, search, find and replace and more. Add custom CSS to any element or add your own code to any page using the Divi code module or Page Settings Custom CSS area.\n\nBuild Your Design Library\n\nEach installation of Divi comes with access to the Divi Library where you can save design elements, page layouts, headers and footers, and more for easy access when you’re building websites. Divi also comes with thousands of premade layouts you can use any time!\n\nGlobal Elements and Dynamic Content\n\nWith Divi, you’re able to save builder elements (sections, rows, modules) as global designs across your website. That means whenever you update a global element, it will automatically synch those changes anywhere else that element appears on your website, saving you time and headaches! Divi also has the capability to display dynamic content (like your logo, a blog post’s title, search results, and more) so that you can spend less time editing every single page and instead make changes with one click.\n\nMobile and Wireframe View Modes\n\nThere are multiple ways to build with Divi. You can freely switch between different view modes, choosing the one that best suits you or your current project. Zoom in and out, toggle through mobile device views, switch between unique interaction modes or build your page structures quickly in wire-frame mode. It’s up to you.\n\nHistory, Auto Saves & Browser Backups\n\nDivi has your back. Every action you perform while building is saved into your editing history. You can undo, redo and explore revisions with ease. If something goes wrong, like your internet going down or your computer crashing, Divi will automatically save your progress so that you can restore it.\n\nRight Click Options\n\nDivi also comes with powerful right-click options that make designing even faster! Learn all about what’s possible with Divi’s right-click options here.\n\nDivi Builder Best Tips & Practices\n\nThere are many ways to use Divi in your design business and each Divi designer and developer will have their own method and workflow that works for them and we encourage you to find what process works best for you! However, we have a few recommendations on ways you can maximize Divi, simplify your workflow, and streamline your design processes.\n\nSwitch Back and Forth Between Visual Builder & Wireframe Mode\n\nOne of the great things about Divi’s Visual Builder is that it’s easy to switch between editing on the frontend and editing on the backend. Changing between both views takes literally less than one second. Switching between viewing your design on the frontend and viewing the wireframe layout can help you quickly drag and drop elements and view the structure of your design.\n\nUse the Zoom Out Feature\n\nI’m sure you’ve done it too – taken a screen shot of your page design to see how everything looks together. The Zoom icon on the Divi toolbar allows you to quickly take a bird’s eye view of your design instead of having to save, exit, and take a screenshot.\n\nDivi Builder Resources\n7 Divi UX Best Practices You Should Keep in Mind\n7 Practical Tips for the Divi Theme Builder\nDivi Keyboard Shortcuts\nContinue Learning\nDivi Theme Options\nDivi Library\nBrowse Divi Documentation"

This is another place where you customize your site with CSS and JavaScript.\n\nUpdates\n\nThe updates tab is where you’ll paste your Elegant Themes membership info so that your Divi install is linked to your ET account, ensuring you have access to all future updates and features of Divi.\n\nAll Divi Theme Options and Settings Explained\n\nIn this section, we’ll go over every single setting in detail.\n\nGeneral Settings\n\nThis is where the general settings for Divi’s Theme Options live. Here you’ll find two sub-tabs: General and Performance.\n\nGeneral\n\nIn the General sub-tab, you’ll find general settings options for things like your site’s logo, color palette, social media links, Google fonts, back-to-top button, a custom CSS block where you can add custom CSS to your theme, and more.\n\nLogo\n\nHere you can add a global logo for your website. Click the upload button to load the WordPress Media Library and select a logo or upload a new one. To reset this field, click the reset button. The logo you set here will appear wherever a logo is called in your Divi Theme. For example, Divi’s menu module calls for a logo that you can dynamically set to display the global logo set here.\n\nFixed Navigation Bar\n\nIf you are not using the Theme Builder to design your navigation bar, then Divi comes inherent with a navigation bar at the top of each page. By default, the navigation bar is fixed, meaning it sticks to the top of the screen and stays visible even as the page scrolls. The navigation bar will shrink slightly as the page scrolls to provide more screen space for the rest of the page content. To disable this feature, toggle this option off. This will result in a navigation menu bar that will stay at the top of the page as the page scrolls and not be visible once the page is scrolled out of the menu’s viewport.\n\nEnable Divi Gallery\n\nBy default, the WordPress media library uploader window contains a “Create Gallery” feature which allows you to add images to a gallery for your posts or pages. If you’d like to replace the default WordPress gallery style with the Divi-style gallery, then enable this option.\n\nColor Pickers Default Palette\n\nWherever color options are available within Divi a default color palette is shown. Here you can choose which colors you want to show by default across the Visual Builder. This is just the beginning of managing colors within Divi. Check out the Color Management Documentation to see all that’s possible with color settings in Divi.\n\nGrab the first post image\n\nBy default thumbnail images for posts or pages are created using custom fields. However, if you would rather use the images that are already in your post for your thumbnail (and bypass using custom fields) you can activate this option. Once activated thumbnail images will be generated automatically using the first image in your post. The image must be hosted on your website.\n\nBlog Style Mode\n\nBy default, posts are truncated on index/homepages automatically to display post previews. If you would rather display full posts on index pages like a traditional blog then you can activate this feature.\n\nSidebar Layout\n\nThis defines where default sidebars appear on a page. Select Left or Right from the dropdown menu.\n\nShop Page & Category Page Layout for WooCommerce\n\nIf you will be using WooCommerce integration, you can define which layout you want your shop to use on product and product category pages.\n\nGoogle API Key\n\nIf you’d like to display a map on your website, then you’ll need a Google Maps API Key. The Divi Maps module requires a valid Google API Key in order to function. Learn more about how to create your Google API Key here.\n\nUse Google Fonts\n\nEnable this option if you want to be able to use Google Fonts on your website. Google Fonts is a free font service that provides over a thousand free fonts.\n\nGoogle Fonts Subsets\n\nThis will enable Google Fonts for Non-English languages.\n\nEnqueue Google Maps Script\n\nDisable this option to remove the Google Maps API script from your Divi Builder Pages. This may improve compatibility with third-party plugins that also enqueue this script.\n\nPlease Note: Modules that rely on the Google Maps API in order to function properly, such as the Maps and Fullwidth Maps Modules, will still be available but will not function while this option is disabled (unless you manually add Google Maps API script).\n\nShow Facebook Icon\n\nToggle this option on or off to show or hide the Facebook icon in modules that call for it like the Social Media Follow module.\n\nShow Twitter Icon\n\nToggle this option on or off to show or hide the Twitter icon in modules that call for it like the Social Media Follow module.\n\nShow Instagram Icon\n\nToggle this option on or off to show or hide the Instagram icon in modules that call for it like the Social Media Follow module.\n\nShow RSS Icon\n\nToggle this option on or off to show or hide the RSS icon in modules that call for it.\n\nFacebook Profile URL\n\nPaste the link to your Facebook profile here.\n\nTwitter Profile URL\n\nPaste the link to your Twitter profile here.\n\nInstagram Profile URL\n\nPaste the link to your Instagram profile here.\n\nRSS Icon URL\n\nPaste the link to your RSS Feed here.\n\nNumber of Products displayed on WooCommerce archive pages\n\nHere you can designate how many WooCommerce products are displayed on the archive page. This option works independently from the Settings > Reading options in wp-admin.\n\nNumber of Posts displayed on Category page\n\nDefine how many posts you would like to be displayed when a user visits a Category Page.\n\nNumber of Posts displayed on Archive pages\n\nDefine how many posts you would like to be displayed when a user visits an Archive Page.\n\nNumber of Posts displayed on Search pages\n\nDefine how many posts you would like to be displayed when a user visits a Search Results Page.\n\nNumber of Posts displayed on Tag pages\n\nDefine how many posts you would like to be displayed when a user visits a Tag Page.\n\nDate format\n\nThis option allows you to change how your dates are displayed. For more information please refer to the WordPress codex here: Formatting Date and Time.\n\nUse excerpts when defined\n\nThis will enable the use of excerpts in posts or pages.\n\nBack To Top Button\n\nThis gives you the option to display a Back To Top Button (at the bottom right of your page) while scrolling.\n\nSmooth Scrolling\n\nEnable this option to get the smooth scrolling effect with mouse wheel. Smooth Scrolling is also especially useful when using anchor links to link to specific areas of the page.\n\nDisable Translations\n\nDisable translations if you don’t want to display translated theme strings on your site.\n\nEnable Responsive Images\n\nEnable this option to get responsive images size generated when uploading images and adding srcset attribute for images element.\n\nCustom CSS\n\nThis is where you can enter any custom CSS to customize your site. For extensive CSS modifications, we recommend that you always use a child theme.\n\nPerformance\n\nHere in the Performance sub-tab are settings you can tweak to improve your website’s speed and performance.\n\nDynamic Module Framework\n\nEnable this to allow the Divi Framework to only load the modules that are used on the page, and process the logic for the features in use.\n\nDynamic CSS\n\nDynamic CSS greatly reduces CSS file size by dynamically generating only the assets necessary for the features and modules you use. This eliminates all file bloat and greatly improves load times.\n\nDynamic Icons\n\nThe Divi icon font is broken up into various subsets. These subsets are loaded only when needed based on the modules and features used on each page. If you need access to the entire icon font on all pages (for example, if you are using our icon font in your child theme), then you can disable this option and load the entire icon font library on all pages.\n\nLoad Dynamic Stylesheet In-line\n\nThis option dequeues the Divi style.css file and prints the contents in-line. This removes a render-blocking request and improves the PageSpeed scores of individual pages. However, it also prevents the style.css file from being cached. Since the stylesheet is small, it’s recommended to keep this option enabled.\n\nCritical CSS\n\nCritical CSS greatly improves website load times and Google PageSpeed scores by deferring non-critical styles and eliminating render-blocking CSS requests.\n\nCritical Threshold Height\n\nWhen Critical CSS is enabled, Divi determines an “above the fold threshold” and defers all styles for elements below the fold. However, this threshold is just an estimate and can vary on different devices. Increasing threshold height will deffer fewer styles, resulting in slightly slower load times but less of a chance for Cumulative Layout Shifts to occur. If you are experiencing CLS issues you can increase the threshold height.\n\nDynamic JavaScript Libraries\n\nOnly load external JavaScript libraries when they are needed by specific Divi modules on the page. This removes unused JavaScript from the main scripts bundle and improves load times.\n\nDisable WordPress Emojis\n\nWordPress loads it’s own WordPress emojis. Modern browsers support native emojis, making WordPress’s emojis unnecessary in most cases. Removing WordPress emojis removes unneeded assets and improves performance.\n\nDefer Gutenberg Block CSS\n\nIf a page is built with the Divi Builder, the Gutenberg block CSS file is moved from the header to the footer. Since the file is most likely not used, we can load it later. This removes a render-blocking request and improves performance.\n\nImprove Google Fonts Loading\n\nEnable caching of Google Fonts and load them inline. This reduces render-blocking requests and improves page load times.\n\nLimit Google Fonts Support For Legacy Browsers\n\nEnabling this option will lower the size of Google Fonts and improve load times, however, it will limit Google Fonts support in some very old browsers. You can turn this off to increase support for older browsers at a slight cost to performance.\n\nDefer jQuere and jQuere Migrate\n\nWhen possible, jQuery and jQuery Migrate will be moved to the body to speed up load times. If a third-party plugin registers jQuery as a dependency, it will be moved back to the head.\n\nEnqueue jQuery Compatibility Script\n\nSome third-party scripts may be incorrectly enqueued without declaring jQuery as a dependency. If jQuery is deferred, these scripts could break. If you are experiencing console errors after enabling the “Defer jQuery And jQuery Migrate” option, you can enable this option, which will load an additional compatibility script that will attempt to solve the issue. You can turn this feature off if everything is working fine without it.\n\nDefer Additional Third Party Scripts\n\nWarning: This can cause JavaScript errors in some cases and should be used with care. When enabled, scripts registered by plugins and themes will be deferred to improve performance and jQuery will always be loaded in the body.\n\nNavigation Settings\n\nIn the Navigation settings tab, there are three sub-tabs: Pages, Categories, and General Settings.\n\nPages\n\nIn the Pages sub-tab there are numerous settings for pages.\n\n \n\nExclude pages from the navigation bar\n\nHere you can choose to remove certain pages from the navigation menu. All pages marked with an X will not appear in your navigation bar.\n\nShow dropdown menus\n\nIf you would like to remove the dropdown menus from the pages navigation bar disable this feature.\n\nDisplay Home link\n\nBy default, the theme creates a Home link that, when clicked, leads back to your blog’s homepage. If, however, you are using a static homepage and have already created a page called Home to use, this will result in a duplicate link. In this case, you should disable this feature to remove the link.\n\nSort Pages Links\n\nHere you can choose to sort your pages links.\n\nOrder Pages Links by Ascending/Descending\n\nHere you can choose to reverse the order that your pages links are displayed. You can choose between ascending and descending.\n\nNumber of dropdown tiers shown\n\nThis option allows you to control how many tiers your pages dropdown menu has. Increasing the number allows for additional menu items to be shown.\n\nCategories\n\nIn the Categories sub-tab there are multiple settings for categories.\n\nExclude categories from the navigation bar\n\nHere you can choose to remove certain categories from the navigation menu. All categories marked with an X will not appear in your navigation bar.\n\nShow dropdown menus\n\nIf you would like to remove the dropdown menus from the categories navigation bar disable this feature.\n\nHide empty categories\n\nIf you would like categories to be displayed in your navigation bar that don’t have any posts in them then disable this option. By default, empty categories are hidden.\n\nNumber of dropdown tiers shown\n\nThis option allows you to control how many tiers your pages dropdown menu has. Increasing the number allows for additional menu items to be shown.\n\nSort Categories Links by Name/ID/Slug/Count/Term Group\n\nBy default, pages are sorted by name. However, if you would rather have them sorted by ID you can adjust this setting.\n\nOrder Category Links by Ascending/Descending\n\nHere you can choose to reverse the order in which your categories links are displayed. You can choose between ascending and descending.\n\nGeneral Settings\n\nIn the General settings there is an option to disable top-tier dropdown menu links.\n\nDisable top tier dropdown menu links\n\nIn some cases, users will want to create parent categories or links as placeholders to hold a list of child links or categories. In this case, it is not desirable to have the parent links lead anywhere, but instead merely serve an organizational function. Enabling this option will remove the links from all parent pages/categories so that they don’t lead anywhere when clicked.\n\nBuilder Settings\n\nIn the Builder Settings tab there are two sub-tabs: Post Type Integration and Advanced.\n\nPost Type Integration\n\nIn the Post Type Integration sub-tab there are settings that affect posts on your website.\n\nEnable Divi Builder On Post Types\n\nBy default, the Divi Builder is only accessible on standard post types. This option lets you enable the builder on any custom post type currently registered on your website, however the builder may not be compatible with all custom post types.\n\nProduct Layout\n\nHere you can choose Product Page Layout for WooCommerce.\n\nProduct Content\n\n“Build From Scratch” loads a pre-built WooCommerce page layout, with which you build on when the Divi Builder is enabled. The “Default” option lets you use the default WooCommerce page layout.\n\nAdvanced\n\nIn the Advanced sub-tab there are settings that affect CSS and other Divi Builder experiences.\n\nStatic CSS File Generation\n\nWhen this option is enabled, the builder’s inline CSS styles for all pages will be cached and served as static files. Enabling this option can help improve performance.\n\nOutput Styles Inline\n\nWith previous versions of the builder, CSS styles for the modules’ design settings were output inline in the footer. Enable this option to restore that behavior.\n\nProduct Tour\n\nIf enabled Product Tour will be started automatically when the Visual Builder is launched for the first time.\n\nEnable The Latest Divi Builder Experience\n\nDisabling this option will load the legacy Divi Builder interface when editing a post using the classic WordPress post editor. The legacy builder lacks many features and interface improvements, but it can still be used if you are experiencing trouble with the new interface.\n\nEnable Classic Editor\n\nEnable this option to use the Classic Editor instead of Gutenberg / Block Editor.\n\nLayout Settings\n\nIn the Layout Settings tab there are three sub-tabs: Single Post Layout, Single Page Layout, and General Settings.\n\nSingle Post Layout\n\nIn the Single Post Layout sub-tab, you’ll see the settings for choosing what information to display in the post info section, showing or hiding comments on posts, and placing thumbnails on posts.\n\nChoose which items to display in the post info section\n\nHere you can choose which items appear in the post info section on single post pages. This is the area, usually below the post title, which displays basic information about your post. The highlighted items shown below will appear.\n\nShow comments on posts\n\nYou can disable this option if you want to remove the comments and comment form from single post pages.\n\nPlace Thumbs on Posts\n\nBy default, thumbnails are placed at the beginning of your post on single post pages. If you would like to remove this initial thumbnail image to avoid repetition simply disable this option.\n\nSingle Page Layout\n\nIn the Single Page Layout sub-tab, you’ll find the settings to place thumbs on pages and allow or disable comments on pages.\n\nPlace Thumbs on Pages\n\nBy default, thumbnails are not placed on pages (they are only used on posts). However, if you want to use thumbnails on pages you can! Just enable this option.\n\nShow comments on pages\n\nBy default comments are not placed on pages, however, if you would like to allow people to comment on your pages simply enable this option.\n\nGeneral Settings\n\nIn the General Settings sub-tab, you’ll find settings for post info section, and showing or hiding thumbs on index pages.\n\nPost info section\n\nHere you can choose which items appear in the post info section on pages. This is the area, usually below the post title, which displays basic information about your post. The highlighted items shown below will appear.\n\nShow Thumbs on Index pages\n\nEnable this option to show thumbnails on Index Pages.\n\nAds Settings\n\nIn the Ads tab, you’ll find settings that configure ads displayed on your website that are not configured through widgets.\n\nManage Un-widgetized Advertisements\nEnable Single Post 468×60 banner\n\nEnabling this option will display a 468×60 banner ad on the bottom of your post pages below the single post content. If enabled you must fill in the banner image and destination URL below.\n\nInput 468×60 advertisement banner image\n\nHere you can provide 468×60 banner image URL.\n\nInput 468×60 advertisement destination url\n\nHere you can provide 468×60 banner destination URL.\n\nInput 468×60 adsense code\n\nPlace your adsense code here.\n\nSEO Settings\n\nIn the SEO tab, you’ll find three sub-tabs: Homepage SEO, Single Post SEO, and Index Page SEO.\n\nHomepage SEO\n\nIn the Homepage SEO sub-tab, you’ll find settings like enabling custom titles, meta descriptions, meta keywords, and more, for the homepage specifically.\n\nEnable custom title\n\nBy default the theme uses a combination of your blog name and your blog description, as defined when you created your blog, to create your homepage titles. However, if you want to create a custom title then simply enable this option and fill in the custom title field below.\n\nEnable meta description\n\nBy default the theme uses your blog description, as defined when you created your blog, to fill in the meta description field. If you would like to use a different description then enable this option and fill in the custom description field below.\n\nenable meta keywords\n\nBy default, the theme does not add keywords to your header. Most search engines don’t use keywords to rank your site anymore, but some people define them anyway just in case. If you want to add meta keywords to your header then enable this option and fill in the custom keywords field below.\n\nEnable canonical URL’s\n\nCanonicalization helps to prevent the indexing of duplicate content by search engines, and as a result, may help avoid duplicate content penalties and PageRank degradation. Some pages may have different URLs all leading to the same place. For example, domain.com, domain.com/index.html, and www.domain.com are all different URLs leading to your homepage. From a search engine’s perspective these duplicate URLs, which also occur often due to custom permalinks, may be treated individually instead of as a single destination. Defining a canonical URL tells the search engine which URL you would like to use officially. The theme bases its canonical URLs on your permalinks and the domain name defined in the settings tab of wp-admin.\n\nHomepage custom title (if enabled)\n\nIf you have enabled custom titles you can add your custom title here. Whatever you type here will be placed between the < title >< /title > tags in header.php\n\nHomepage meta keywords (if enabled)\n\nIf you have enabled meta descriptions you can add your custom description here.\n\nIf custom ties are disabled, choose autogeneration method\n\nIf you are not using custom post titles you can still have control over how your titles are generated. Here you can choose which order you would like your post title and blog name to be displayed, or you can remove the blog name from the title completely.\n\nDefine a character to separate BlogName and Post title\n\nHere you can change which character separates your blog title and post name when using autogenerated post titles. Common values are | or –\n\nSingle Post Page SEO\n\nIn the Single Post SEO sub-tab, you’ll find the settings like enabling custom titles, meta descriptions, meta keywords, and more for single posts.\n\nEnable custom titles\n\nBy default, the theme creates post titles based on the title of your post and your blog name. If you would like to make your meta title different than your actual post title you can define a custom title for each post using custom fields. This option must be enabled for custom titles to work, and you must choose a custom field name for your title below.\n\nEnable meta description\n\nIf you would like to add a meta description to your post you can do so using custom fields. This option must be enabled for descriptions to be displayed on post pages. You can add your meta description using custom fields based on the custom field name you define below.\n\nEnable custom keywords\n\nIf you would like to add meta keywords to your post you can do so using custom fields. This option must be enabled for keywords to be displayed on post pages.

Some pages may have different URLs all leading to the same place. For example, domain.com, domain.com/index.html, and www.domain.com are all different URLs leading to your homepage. From a search engine’s perspective these duplicate URLs, which also occur often due to custom permalinks, may be treated individually instead of as a single destination. Defining a canonical URL tells the search engine which URL you would like to use officially. The theme bases its canonical URLs on your permalinks and the domain name defined in the settings tab of wp-admin.\n\nCustom field Name to be used for title\n\nWhen you define your title using custom fields you should use this value for the custom field Name. The Value of your custom field should be the custom title you would like to use.\n\nCustom field Name to be used for description\n\nWhen you define your meta description using custom fields you should use this value for the custom field Name.

The Value of your custom field should be the meta keywords you would like to use, separated by commas.\n\nIf custom titles are disabled, choose autogeneration method\n\nIf you are not using custom post titles you can still have control over how your titles are generated. Here you can choose which order you would like your post title and blog name to be displayed, or you can remove the blog name from the title completely.\n\nDefine a c character to separate BlogName and Post title\n\nHere you can change which character separates your blog title and post name when using autogenerated post titles. Common values are | or –\n\nIndex Page SEO\n\nIn the Index Page SEO sub-tab, you’ll find settings for enabling canonical URLs, meta descriptions and more.\n\nEnable canonical URL’s\n\nCanonicalization helps to prevent the indexing of duplicate content by search engines, and as a result, may help avoid duplicate content penalties and PageRank degradation. Some pages may have different URLs all leading to the same place. For example, domain.com, domain.com/index.html, and www.domain.com are all different URLs leading to your homepage.

Defining a canonical URL tells the search engine which URL you would like to use officially. The theme bases its canonical URLs on your permalinks and the domain name defined in the settings tab of wp-admin.\n\nEnable meta descriptions\n\nCheck this box if you want to display meta descriptions on category/archive pages.

This allows you to remove the code while saving it for later use.\n\nAdd code to the < head > of your blog\n\nAny code you place here will appear in the head section of every page of your blog. This is useful when you need to add javascript or css to all pages.\n\nAdd code to the < body > (good for tracking codes such as google analytics)\n\nAny code you place here will appear in body section of all pages of your blog.

    "html": "Divi Theme Documentation\nENTER SEARCH TERM\nDIVI\nEXTRA\nBLOOM\nMONARCH\nDIVI BUILDER\nDEVELOPERS\nBACK TO DIVI THEME DOCUMENTATION\nHow To Install The Divi Theme\n\nInstalling our themes can be done using the WP Dashboard.\n\nThe Divi Theme is more than just a WordPress theme, it’s the ultimate Visual Builder for WordPress websites. That means you can build custom websites faster than ever before without having to know a single line of code. With its ever-expanding capabilities and community, Divi is the website software you need! In this documentation, we’ll walk you through how to install the Divi theme so that you’re all set up to create the website of your dreams.\n\nHow to Install Divi\n\nThere are two ways to install Divi: a quick install and a manual install. In this doc, we’ll cover both methods.\n\nLet’s get started!\n\nMethod One: Quick Install\n\nThe fastest way to get started with Divi is with Divi Hosting.\n\nInstall Divi with Divi Hosting\n\nWith Divi Hosting, Divi is installed and automatically activated with your unique license key. Plus, you get the benefit of fast WordPress hosting that meets all of Divi’s requirements out of the box! Learn about Divi Hosting here.\n\nMethod Two: Manual Install via the WordPress Dashboard\n\nIf you already have a website and hosting, then use this method to manually install Divi onto your WordPress website.\n\nStep 1: Log Into Your ET Account And Download Divi Theme\n\nBefore we can install the Divi Theme on your WordPress website, we’ll need the Divi Theme zip file. Log into your Elegant Themes Account and navigate to the Members Area. Click the “Download The Divi Theme” button to save the Divi Theme zip file to your desktop.\n\nNote: If you’re using a Mac with Safari, your zip files will automatically be unzipped. To avoid this you’ll need to adjust your Safari Preferences. Learn how to do that here.\n\nStep 2: Log Into Your WordPress Website\n\nNow that you have the Divi Theme zip file, navigate to your WordPress dashboard. You’ll need to have admin privileges in order to upload a new theme.\n\nOn the WordPress sidebar, hover over “Appearance” and click “Themes”. This is where your website themes live.\n\nClick the “Add New” button at the top. This will load the WordPress theme library where we can upload our own theme zip file.\n\nClick the “Upload Theme” button at the top of the page. This will show an upload form.\n\nDrag and drop the divi.zip file you downloaded from your ET Members Area, or click the “Choose File” button to navigate to the downloaded file on your computer. Once you have the divi.zip file added to the upload form, click the “Install Theme” button.\n\nNow that the Divi Theme is installed on your website, you can click “Activate” to activate the Divi theme on your website.\n\nHow to Authenticate Your Divi Account\n\nIn order to access future Divi updates and Premade Layout Packs, you’ll need to authenticate your Elegant Themes membership and link it with the Divi install on your WordPress website. To do so, you’ll need to add your Elegant Themes username and API Key to the Divi Theme Options.\n\nFirst, log into your Elegant Themes account and navigate to Account > API Keys and copy your API Key. If you do not have any API keys generated, click the “Generate New API Key” button. Above each API key is an input field where you can add a title (like what site you are using the API key on) which is especially handy if you’re using Divi to design and build client websites.\n\nThen, go to your WordPress website dashboard and navigate to Divi > Theme Options > Updates.  Enter your username and API key in the appropriate fields and click Save Changes.\n\nNow your Elegant Themes membership has been linked with that Divi install and authenticated your website to receive future Divi updates.\n\nAnd there you have it! Now you have the Divi Theme installed on your website, which means you can now use all the functionalities and exceptional design capabilities Divi has to offer to build your dream website!\n\nContinue Learning\n\nContinue on your journey of mastering Divi by checking out more documentation:\n\nGetting Started With The Visual Builder\nConfiguring Divi Theme Options\nBrowse Divi Documentation"
