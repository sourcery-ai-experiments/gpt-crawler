If the token and secret are not valid, check if NetSuite Web UI revoked the token.\n\nIf you use NetSuite Sandbox, keep in mind, that the Sandbox may be rolled back to its original state. It breaks the connection. Learn more about checking if the token is valid.\n\nStandard Record\n\nYou can watch, search, create or update, retrieve, and delete records using the following modules.\n\nNote\n\nSome entity fields describing a record type are displayed with their internal API names instead of their NetSuite labels.

You can log into Looker Studio or create an account on the Looker Studio page.\n\nA Make Data Source created and authorized in Looker Studio.\n\nA created (and executed) scenario\n\nWarning\n\nTo establish a connection to Looker Studio you must create and run your scenario beforehand! See the instructions below.\n\nNote\n\nMake's use and transfer of information received from Google APIs to any other app will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy.\n\nCreating a Make Data Source in Looker Studio\n\nCreate your scenario.\n\nNote\n\nYou must run the scenario before you connect to the Make data source in Looker Studio.\n\nEach Looker Studio scenario in Make must have at least two modules: the webhook, New Request (the first module in the scenario) and the responder/aggregator, New Response (the last module in the scenario in which you must specify a structure for your data). Between these two modules, you should place other modules.\n\nUse the New Request module to generate a webhook URL.\n\nCopy the Webhook URL to use it in step 6.\n\nSave the scenario and Run it by clicking the Run Once button\n\nClick the following link to add the Make data source to Looker Studio:\n\nhttps://datastudio.google.com/datasources/create?connectorId=AKfycbwUsUqXSVNBmjwrv90WcFjLR41NMIyEus4xuwl9DvQ_wCESH4IKxxrge8eoOF012AvD\n\nTo confirm the action click on the AUTHORIZE button.\n\nSign-in using your Google account credentials and grant access rights by clicking on the ALLOW button.\n\nPaste the Make webhook URL - use the webhook URL from step 1.\n\nClick on the CONNECT button in the top-right corner.\n\nRename the Data Source if needed:\n\nAdd the data source to your report.\n\nAggregators\nNew response\n\nThis module must be the last module in your scenario.

The aggregated data will be then separated under Groups with the same expression's value. Each Group outputs as a separate bundle and contains a Key with the evaluated expression and the aggregated text. By doing this, you can use the Key as a filter in subsequent modules.\n\n\n\n\nStop processing after an empty aggregation\n\n\t\n\nEnable this option to stop the scenario when no data is received.\n\n\n\n\nValues\n\n\t\n\nEnter Name and Value.\n\nWarning\n\nThe name of the Name field in the Schema section must be the same as the name of the Name field in the Values section.\n\nData Set Configuration Error\n\nIf you get this error message, make sure that:\n\nYou run your Make scenario before performing an action in Looker Studio.\n\nThe webhook in your active New Request module matches the webhook URL used in the Make Looker Studio data source.\n\nSample scenario\n\nThe following scenario will collect data from the Weather > Get Daily Weather Forecast module and will create a chart in the Looker Studio.\n\nLooker Studio > New Request module\nWeather > Get Daily Weather Forecast module\nLooker Studio > New Response module\nLooker Studio\nGetting Started with Looker Studio\nPrerequisites:\nCreating a Make Data Source in Looker Studio\nAggregators\nNew response\nData Set Configuration Error\nSample scenario\nLooker Studio > New Request module\nWeather > Get Daily Weather Forecast module\nLooker Studio > New Response module\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

You can use up to 1,000 data stores per single organization, regardless of your plan. Note that the minimum size of one data store is 1 MB.\n\nMake calculates data storage based on the number of your operations per month. For every 10,000 operations per month, you get 10 MB of data storage.\n\nCustomers with operations flexibility on annual plans such as Pro, Team, or Enterprise receive their usage allowance based on monthly operations. For example, an annual plan with 1,200,000 operations for the year has a data storage maximum of 100 MB because there are 100,000 operations per month.\n\nIf you are on the Free plan, you have 1000 operations per month, which equals 1 MB of data storage and 1 data store.\n\nLegacy plan\n\nIf you are an existing Integromat customer, you can still keep using your Integromat plan on the Make platform. Your subscription price and the number of operations remain the same as before the upgrade, and the features are equal to Make Core plan.\n\nAdditionally to the old Integromat plan, you receive the following new features:\n\nMin. 1 minute interval between scheduled scenario executions\n\nUnlimited number of active scenarios\n\nAccess to 300+ Make API endpoints\n\n40 minute scenario execution length\n\nThis plan is called Legacy plan and you can see it on Dashboard > Subscription. Only former Integromat users can have the Legacy plan option.\n\nThe Legacy plan is available until you decide either to upgrade to any of the Make's plans, or cancel your Legacy subscription.\n\nWe always allocate operations monthly, and not annually for the Legacy plan.\n\nList of terms\n1000+ standard apps\n\nIn Make you can choose from over 1000+ ready-made apps to integrate and automate workflows.\n\nAccess to 300+ API endpoints (rate call limit/min)\n\nMake allows you to automate faster and at scale by integrating with one of 300+ public API endpoints of the Make platform.\n\nAccess to enterprise apps\n\nMake enables you to build powerful scenarios with access to exclusive enterprise-grade apps, such as enterprise-grade ERP systems: Automation Anywhere, Coupa, Greenhouse Recruiting, Infor M3 Cloud, Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM, NetSuite, SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud, ServiceNow, Workday Financial Management, and Workday Human Capital Management.\n\nIf this feature is enabled for your organization, you can activate all scenarios that include enterprise apps. Without this capability, you can see enterprise apps and build scenarios, but not activate or run them.\n\nAll enterprise apps are labeled as \"premium tier 3\" in Make.\n\nCompany single sign-on (SSO) access control\n\nSingle sign-on (SSO) allows you to use your own provider of user account management, authentication, and authorization services to register and log in to Make.\n\nYou can control access to Make by setting up your own OAuth2 or SAML2 compliant Identity Provider (IDP). Single sign-on works with Okta, PingOne, Google, Azure, and dozens of others.\n\nCreate and share scenario templates\n\nYou can create public or team templates which are scalable across business functions and user groups. Learn more about templates.\n\nCustom apps\n\nMake enables you to create and install your own custom apps and share these custom apps with others in your organization.\n\nCustomer support\n\nMake team helps you when you have trouble with our product. We make sure that you are successful in solving whatever issues you come upon.\n\nPricing plans differ in priority when it comes to customer support.\n\nCustom functions\n\nCreate your own Javascript functions and use them in scenarios to enhance Make's data transformation capabilities.\n\nCustom scenario properties\n\nAdd customizable metadata to your scenarios so you can organize them by the properties you create. For example, you can add information like a severity tier, client email, or a URL. Once added, you can use this information to filter and sort your scenarios.\n\nCustom variables\n\nEdit and manage your data across multiple scenarios at once.\n\nData storage\n\nMaximum storage capacity for all your data stores. Data stores represent persistent data storage and are a perfect tool for sharing and transferring data among your scenarios. Data is stored directly in your account, no registration at a third-party service is needed. You can have more than one data store, but the total amount of storage capacity will vary depending on your subscription.\n\nData transfer\n\nData transfer is the amount of data transferred through your scenario. Suppose you have a scenario that retrieves a 100kb image from FTP and reduces its size to 50kb and saves both images to Dropbox. The amount of data used in this scenario is 150kb.\n\nThe data moved between modules are counted only once, regardless of the number of modules deployed. The amount of data you have available depends on your subscription.\n\nDedicated customer success manager\n\nAccess to a personal Make advisor who provides onboarding, adoption, and best practice sharing to help you achieve your unique business goals.\n\nExclusive access to a list of premium partners for support\n\nWith this feature, you have exclusive access to a growing list of certified and experienced partners to support you with building workflows.\n\nExecution history full-text search\n\nFull-text search for scenario execution history makes it easier to find the right scenario execution and troubleshoot more effectively.\n\nNote: Enabling the full-text search is not retroactive. After enabling the full-text search, you can use the full-text search to find new scenario executions.\n\nExecution log storage (days)\n\nExecution log storage refers to the number of days that you can access detailed logs for every execution.\n\nHosting\n\nHosting refers to the location where we host the infrastructure that Make runs on.\n\nIncomplete executions store\n\nIn incomplete executions storage scenario stores executions that were not successfully finalized due to an error. Each incomplete execution contains the scenario's blueprint and all the bundles that can be mapped into the failed module. See incomplete executions for further information.\n\nInformation security compliance support\n\nOur information security team does a detailed security review to confirm compliance to standards such as ISO 27001 and SOC 2.\n\nMaximum file size (MB)\n\nThe maximum file size that can be automated and processed. The maximum size of a single file is limited according to your subscription.\n\nSome modules can accept a file in their input and/or yield a file in their output. If the maximum file size is exceeded, Make proceeds in accordance with the settings of the enable data loss option. See working with files for further information.\n\nMaximum number of active scenarios\n\nThe maximum number of scenarios that are active and running at one time. See active and inactive scenarios for further information.\n\nMaximum number of data stores\n\nData stores represent persistent data storage and are a perfect tool for sharing and transferring data among your scenarios. You may think of one data store as a worksheet in a spreadsheet. See data store for further information.\n\nMaximum scenario execution time (min)\n\nThe maximum time for which a single scenario can run. Maximum scenario execution time should not exceed 40 minutes for hosted version and 60 minutes for a private instance. See scenario execution, cycles and phases for further information.\n\nMinimum interval between scheduled scenarios (min)\n\nMinimum interval is the shortest possible time in-between two successive scenario runs. You can set the interval in the schedule setting panel.\n\nNo-code workflow builder\n\nMake visual no-code workflow builder enables you to design, build, and automate using our drag-and-drop interface.\n\nOn-prem agent ()\n\nWith the On-premise agent (On-prem agent) installed on your machine, your scenarios can access applications and databases on your local network without changing the settings of your firewall.\n\nOperations overage protection\n\nThis feature permits you to go over your allocated operations limit without worrying that your scenarios will cease to operate.\n\nOperations usage flexibility\n\nThis feature gives you the flexibility to purchase an annual package of operations upfront. Unused operations expire only after 12 months, so you don't have to worry about operations expiring every month.\n\nIn Core plan, you receive operations every month and they always expire at the end of the month. In Pro and Teams plan, you receive your operations at the beginning of the term so it is good to have a yearly plan to handle seasonality.\n\nParallel scenario executions\n\nWith parallel scenario executions, you can process multiple incoming items simultaneously, instead of one after the other.\n\nPriority scenario execution\n\nIn rare cases of high volume periods, Make executes your scenarios according to the priority of your plan tier to eliminate queuing time as much as possible.\n\nEach organization is assigned an execution priority. This priority identifies the order in which executions take place during high-volume periods.\n\nReal-time execution monitoring\n\nYou can view executions happening in real-time from within your browser.\n\nScenario inputs\n\nAllow everyone to run complex scenarios by just filling in inputs that are marked as required.\n\nSystem variables\n\nGet detailed information about your scenarios, current executions, teams, and organizations.\n\nTeams and team roles\n\nWith this feature, you can create and manage an unlimited number of teams in a single organization. Team roles enable granular permission rights and controlled user access to scenarios applications, templates, and connections within the shared teams' folders.\n\nTwo-factor authentication\n\nMake your Make account more secure using two-factor authentication (2FA). 2FA means that there are two different factors (your Make credentials and an additional verification code) needed to authenticate you as a user when logging into your Make account.\n\nUnlimited users\n\nYou can have an unlimited number of users in your organization. With Make you can share access with users in your organization to collaborate on workflows.\n\nWebhook queue size\n\nAll incoming webhooks are stored in a Webhook queue. The queue can start filling up when the scenario responsible for processing the webhooks is disabled (e.g. due to an error) or is processing the webhooks at a slower rate than they are being received. See instant triggers (webhooks) for further information.\n\nIn this section\nFeatures list\nUsage allowance\nLegacy plan\nList of terms\nPricing parameters\nFeatures list\nUsage allowance\nLegacy plan\nList of terms\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

You can now edit and add more Workday Financial Management modules. If your connection requires reauthorization, follow the connection renewal steps here.\n\nEstablish the connection with Workday Financial Management in Make via OAuth2\n\nBefore establishing an OAuth2 connection, your Workday system administrator must complete the steps in the Set Up Workday Financial Management for OAuth2 Connections section to generate client credentials and refresh tokens.\n\nLog in to your Make account, add a Workday Financial Management module to your scenario, and click Create a connection.\n\nIn the Connection type dropdown, select Workday Financial Management OAuth2.\n\nEnter your Host URL Address. For example, https://HostName.workday.com. Do not include a trailing slash.\n\nEnter your Tenant ID. This can be located in your account URL address as follows: https://HostName.workday.com/TenantID/d/home/html.\n\nIn the Client ID and Client Secret fields, enter your client credentials.\n\nEnter the Refresh Token for the connection, provided by your Workday system administrator. Each connection should have its own refresh token as sharing tokens may result in connections being broken.\n\nWorkday system administrators can generate tokens in Workday > View API Clients > Manage Refresh Tokens for integrations.\n\nSet the Access Token Expiry in Seconds, provided by your Workday system administrator. This value must be the same as the token expiry settings in Workday.\n\nClick Save.\n\nYou have successfully established the connection. You can now edit and add more Workday Financial Management modules. If your connection requires reauthorization, follow the connection renewal steps here.\n\nSet Up Workday Financial Management for OAuth2 Connections\n\nFollow these steps in Workday to retrieve the client credentials and refresh tokens necessary to establish an OAuth2 connection:\n\nGenerate Client Credentials\n\nIn your Workday account search bar, search for and select the Register API Client for Integrations task.\n\nFill in the Client Name field.\n\nCheck the Non-Expiring Refresh Tokens box. This is important to minimize risk of integration down-time. If it is not selected, a new refresh token must be manually created and entered into Make after each expiration.\n\nAdd the following Scopes (Functional Areas): System for WQL functionality and Tenant Non-Configurable for RAAS functionality.\n\nClick OK.\n\nCopy the Client ID and Client Secret values and store them in a safe place. This is important as you will not be able to view the Client Secret again after leaving this page. If you lose the Client Secret, you will be required to generate new credentials.\n\nYou have successfully created the Client ID and Client Secret to be used when creating the OAuth2 connection in Make.\n\nConfigure Refresh Tokens\n\nIn your Workday account, go to View API Clients.\n\nFind the relevant API Client and click on ... > API Client > Manage Refresh Tokens for Integrations.\n\nNote: This is also where you can edit API Client scopes, generate new client secrets, and find new refresh tokens if an expiration date was set.\n\nIn the Manage Refresh Tokens for Integrations window, enter the Workday Account to be assigned to the API Client. This account must have access to the reports you would like to work with. WQL, RAAS, and SOAP API security is tied to the Workday account.\n\nClick OK.\n\nIn the Delete or Regenerate Refresh Token task, click the Generate New Refresh Token box.\n\nCopy the Refresh Token and store it in a safe place.\n\nNote: Each Workday account will have its own refresh token, but can have the same Client ID and Client Secret as other accounts linked to the same API Client.\n\nYou have successfully created the Refresh Token to be used when creating the OAuth2 connection in Make.\n\nSupplier Invoices\n\nYou can create, update, search, retrieve, and cancel invoices with the following modules.\n\nSearch Supplier Invoices\nCreate a Supplier Invoice\nGet Supplier Invoices\nUpdate a Supplier Invoice\nCancel a Supplier Invoice\nOther\nList Currencies\nMake a SOAP API Call\nMake a SOAP API Call (Advanced)\nRun a WQL Query\nGet a RaaS Report\nWorkday Financial Management\nConnect Workday Financial Management to Make\nEstablish the connection with Workday Financial Management in Make via User Credentials\nEstablish the connection with Workday Financial Management in Make via OAuth2\nSupplier Invoices\nSearch Supplier Invoices\nCreate a Supplier Invoice\nGet Supplier Invoices\nUpdate a Supplier Invoice\nCancel a Supplier Invoice\nOther\nList Currencies\nMake a SOAP API Call\nMake a SOAP API Call (Advanced)\nRun a WQL Query\nGet a RaaS Report\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

HTTP is the fundamental component of data transfer for the World Wide Web. As the backbone of information exchange between web servers and clients, HTTP allows you to download web pages, access files, make API calls, and trigger webhooks.\n\nOverview of the HTTP modules\n\nSelect a module of the HTTP app based on the authentication requirements of the resource you want to use. To use modules that require authentication, you have to create a connection first.\n\nMake a request: universal module, best to use for resources that do not require authentication.\n\nMake a basic auth request: for resources that require basic authentication.\n\nMake an API key Auth request: for resources that require API key authentication.\n\nMake an OAuth 2.0 request: for resources that require OAuth 2.0 authorization.\n\nMake a client certificate auth request: for resources that require client-side certificate authentication.\n\nGet a file: download a file from the URL.\n\nResolve a target URL: retrieve the target URL from a chain of HTTP redirects.\n\nRetrieve headers: to get headers from the HTTP request module in separate bundles.\n\nNote\n\nThe module dialog fields that are displayed in bold (in the Makescenario, not in this documentation article) are mandatory!\n\nMake a request\n\nThe Make a request module allows you to create an HTTP request and send it to a server. The output bundle contains the HTTP response.\n\nEvaluate all states as errors (except for 2xx and 3xx)\n\n\t\n\nUse the response status to detect errors. Otherwise, the module reports only Make related errors (like mapping errors or missing required values).\n\n\n\n\nURL\n\n\t\n\nEnter the request URL.\n\n\n\n\nSerialize URL\n\n\t\n\nEncodes the API call URL with the URL encoding (encoding special characters for example).\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\t\n\nSelect the HTTP method you want to use:\n\nGET: to retrieve information for an entry.\n\nPOST: to create a new entry.\n\nPUT: to update/replace an existing entry.\n\nPATCH: to make a partial entry update.\n\nDELETE: to delete an entry.\n\n\n\n\nHeaders\n\n\t\n\nEnter request headers. For example, the response content type.\n\nCaution\n\nThe HTTP app requests do not have the Accept header. If the HTTP request returns an unexpected response, try adding the Accept: */* header.\n\n\n\n\nQuery String\n\n\t\n\nEnter the query key-value pairs.\n\n\n\n\nBody type\n\n\t\n\nHTTP body contains the data transferred in an HTTP request.\n\nRaw\n\n\t\n\nThe Rawbody type is suitable for most HTTP requests, even if the app documentation does not specify the data type.\n\nSpecify the data format of the body content in the Content type field.\n\n\n\n\nApplication/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\n\t\n\nThis body type is to POST data using application/x-www-form-urlencoded.\n\nFor application/x-www-form-urlencoded, the body of the HTTP request sent to the server is one query string. The keys and values are encoded in key-value pairs separated by & and with a = between the key and the value. For binary data, use the multipart/form-data body type instead.\n\nExample of the resulting HTTP request format: field1=value1&field2=value2\n\n\n\n\nMultipart/form-data\n\n\t\n\nUse the multipart/form-data content type to send files in the HTTP request.\n\nAdd fields to the request. Each field must contain a key-value pair:\n\nText: Enter the key and value to send in the request body.\n\nFile: Enter the key, and specify the source file you want to send in the request body. Map the file you want to upload from the previous module (for example: HTTP > Get a File or Google Drive > Download a File), or enter the file name and file data manually.\n\n\n\n\nParse response\n\n\t\n\nEnable to parse HTTP responses into bundles. With this option, you don't need to add the Parse JSON or Parse XML modules. Otherwise, the HTTP module returns the raw response data.\n\nBefore you can use parsed JSON or XML content, run the module once manually so that the module can recognize the response content and allow you to map it in subsequent modules.\n\n\n\n\nUser name\n\n\t\n\nEnter the user name to send the request with the basic auth.\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\t\n\nEnter the password to send the request with the basic auth.\n\n\n\n\nTimeout\n\n\t\n\nSpecify the request timeout in seconds (1-300). Default: 40 seconds.\n\n\n\n\nShare cookies with other HTTP modules\n\n\t\n\nEnable to share cookies from the server with all HTTP modules in your scenario.\n\n\n\n\nSelf-signed certificate\n\n\t\n\nUpload your certificate if you want to use TLS using your self-signed certificate.\n\n\n\n\nReject connections that use unverified (self-signed) certificates\n\n\t\n\nEnable to reject connections that use unverified TLS certificates.\n\n\n\n\nFollow redirect\n\n\t\n\nEnable to follow URL redirects that return 3xx response statuses.\n\n\n\n\nFollow all redirect\n\n\t\n\nEnable to follow URL redirects regardless of response statuses.\n\n\n\n\nDisable serialization of multiple same query string keys as arrays\n\n\t\n\nMake handles multiple values for the same URL query string parameter key as arrays (e.g., www.test.com?foo=bar&amp;foo=baz will be converted to www.test.com?foo[0]=bar&amp;foo[1]=baz). Enable to deactivate this behavior.\n\n\n\n\nRequest compressed content\n\n\t\n\nEnable to request compression of the response data. Adds the Accept-Encoding header.\n\nExample HTTP request with the Make a request module\n\nCheck the following screenshot to see how to set up the Make a request module to send a POST request with the body in the JSON data format:\n\nTo make sure your JSON is valid, use a JSON validator (for example: https://jsonlint.com/) or use a Create JSON module to create the JSON.\n\nCaution\n\nBe careful when combining JSON data with mapping variables or function directly in the Request content field. Mixing JSON with mapping can lead to an invalid JSON structure.\n\nMake a Basic Auth request\n\nThe Make a Basic Auth request module allows you to send an HTTP request with the basic authentication. The output bundle contains the HTTP response.\n\nCredentials\n\n\t\n\nClick Add to add your credentials (user name and password) for basic authentication.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate all states as errors (except for 2xx and 3xx)\n\n\t\n\nUse the response status to detect errors. Otherwise, the module reports only Make related errors (like mapping errors or missing required values).\n\n\n\n\nURL\n\n\t\n\nEnter the request URL.\n\n\n\n\nSerialize URL\n\n\t\n\nEncodes the API call URL with the URL encoding (encoding special characters for example).\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\t\n\nSelect the HTTP method you want to use:\n\nGET - to retrieve information for an entry.\n\nPOST - to create a new entry.\n\nPUT - to update/replace an existing entry.\n\nPATCH - to make a partial entry update.\n\nDELETE - to delete an entry.\n\n\n\n\nHeaders\n\n\t\n\nEnter request headers.

Enable to deactivate this behavior.\n\n\n\n\nRequest compressed content\n\n\t\n\nEnable to request compression of the response data. Adds the Accept-Encoding header.\n\nMake an API key Auth request\n\nThe Make an API key Auth request module allows you to send API calls to apps that require API key authorization. The module also supports \"Bearer\" authorization.\n\nThe output bundle contains the HTTP response.\n\nCreate an API key connection for the Make an API key Auth request module\n\nCheck out the following example if you want to set up a connection for the Make an API key Auth request module:\n\nIn the Make an API key Auth request module settings, click the Add button. The Add a new keychain window pops up.\n\nFill in:\n\nName: The label for your API key connection.\n\nKey: The API key to authorize the HTTP calls. If the API uses \"Bearer\" or \"Token\" authorization, add the word before the API key.\n\nExample: Bearer 1234-5678-abcd-efgh\n\nNote\n\nYou can use the eye icon at the edge of the box to reveal the API key and the text you add to it.

Make allows creating a JWT with the help of custom or built-in functions.\n\nGenerating a JWT via a custom function\n\nYou can create a HS256 or HS512 JWT with the help of Make custom functions.\n\nNote\n\nCustom functions are available to the Enterprise plan users only.\n\nFollow the steps to create a JWT:\n\nGo to Functions and create a custom function using the following body:\n\nfunction readableJWTencode(payload, secret, header = '{\"alg\":\"HS256\",\"typ\":\"JWT\"}') {\n    let formattedHeader = iml.replace(iml.replace(iml.replace(iml.base64(header), \"=\", \"\"), \"+\", \"-\"), \"/\", \"_\")\n    let formattedPayload = iml.replace(iml.replace(iml.replace(iml.base64(payload), \"=\", \"\"), \"+\", \"-\"), \"/\", \"_\")\n    let signature = iml.sha256(formattedHeader + \".\" + formattedPayload, \"base64\", secret)\n    let formattedSignature = iml.replace(iml.replace(iml.replace(signature, \"=\", \"\"), \"+\", \"-\"), \"/\", \"_\")\n    let jwt = formattedHeader + \".\" + formattedPayload + \".\" + formattedSignature\n    return jwt\n}\n\nNote\n\nReplace HS256 with HS512 and sha256 with sha512 in the custom function above to create a HS512 JWT.\n\nThe example custom function has the jwtEncode name embedded onto the function body. If you want to use another name, change it in the body too.\n\nStart your scenario with the Set multiple variables module and add three items:\n\nItem 1:\n\nIn Variable name, enter header.\n\nIn Variable value, enter the following function:\n\n{\"alg\":\"HS256\",\"typ\":\"JWT\"}\n\nNote\n\nReplace HS256 with HS512 to create a HS512 JWT.\n\nItem 2:\n\nIn Variable name, enter payload.\n\nIn Variable value, enter the following function:\n\n{\"var1\":1,\"var2\":\"text\"}\n\nItem 3:\n\nIn Variable name, enter secret.\n\nIn Variable value, enter your 256-bit or 512-bit secret.\n\nAdd another Set multiple variables module to generate the JWT.\n\nOptional: In Variable name, enter the name for the token.\n\nIn Variable value, enter the following function:\n\n{{jwtEncode(11.payload; 11.secret)}}\n\nNote\n\nMake sure to take into account the module number in the code. In the example above, the header, payload and secret are in the 11th module in the scenario. It may vary from one scenario to another.\n\nIf you run the scenario, you will receive the HS256 or HS512 JWT in the second module's output.\n\nYou can connect to an API or send messages that requires JWT authentication.\n\nGenerating a JWT via built-in functions\n\nTo generate a JWT with the help of built-in functions, do the following in your scenario:\n\nStart your scenario with the Set multiple variables module and add three items:\n\nItem 1:\n\nIn Variable name, enter header.\n\nIn Variable value, enter the following function:\n\n{{replace(replace(replace(base64(\"{\"\"alg\"\":\"\"HS256\"\",\"\"typ\"\":\"\"JWT\"\"}\"); \"=\"; emptystring); \"+\"; \"-\"); \"/\"; \"_\")}}\n\nNote\n\nReplace HS256 with HS512 to create a HS512 JWT.\n\nItem 2:\n\nIn Variable name, enter payload.\n\nIn Variable value, enter the following function:\n\n{{replace(replace(replace(base64(\"{\"\"var1\"\":1,\"\"var2\"\":\"\"text\"\"}\"); \"=\"; emptystring); \"+\"; \"-\"); \"/\"; \"_\")}}\n\nItem 3:\n\nIn Variable name, enter secret.\n\nIn Variable value, enter your 256-bit or 512-bit secret.\n\nAdd another Set multiple variables module to generate the HS256 or HS512 JWT.\n\nOptional: In Variable name, enter the name for the token.\n\nIn Variable value, enter the following function:\n\n{{5.header}}.{{5.payload}}.{{replace(replace(replace(sha256(5.header + \".\" + 5.payload; \"base64\"; 5.secret); \"=\"; emptystring); \"+\"; \"-\"); \"/\"; \"_\")}}\n\nNote\n\nUse the sha512 function to create a HS512 JWT.\n\nMake sure to take into account the module number in the code. In the example above, the header, payload and secret are in the 5th module in the scenario. It may vary from one scenario to another.\n\nIf you run the scenario, you will receive the HS256 or HS512 JWT in the second module's output.\n\nYou can connect to an API or send messages that requires JWT authentication.\n\nIn this section\nOverview of the HTTP modules\nMake a request\nMake a Basic Auth request\nMake an API key Auth request\nMake an OAuth 2.0 request\nMake a client certificate authentication request\nGet a file\nResolve a target URL\nRetrieve Headers\nHow to generate JSON Web Tokens (JWT)\nHTTP\nOverview of the HTTP modules\nMake a request\nExample HTTP request with the Make a request module\nMake a Basic Auth request\nMake an API key Auth request\nCreate an API key connection for the Make an API key Auth request module\nMake an OAuth 2.0 request\nCreate an OAuth 2.0 Connection\nModule settings\nMake a client certificate authentication request\nGet a file\nResolve a target URL\nRetrieve Headers\nHow to generate JSON Web Tokens (JWT)\nGenerating a JWT via a custom function\nGenerating a JWT via built-in functions\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Make doesn't support the Client Credentials Grant flow of creating an OAuth 2.0 connection in the HTTP - Make an OAuth 2.0 request module. However you can use the HTTP - Make a request module to get an access token and then make an API call.\n\nImportant\n\nYou need to know your Client ID and Client Secret to get an access token. Read about getting credentials.\n\nGet an access token\n\nFirst, you need to make a request for getting an access token from the service.\n\nIn your scenario, add the HTTP - Make a request module.\n\nIn URL, enter the request URL for getting the access token.\n\nTip\n\nRefer to the app API documentation to get the request URL.\n\nIn Method, select the appropriate method for the endpoint\n\nOptional: In Headers, specify a request header.\n\nOptional: In Query String, enter needed parameters.\n\nIn Body type, select one of the following:\n\nThe Raw option. Proceed to the step 7.\n\nThe Application/x-www-form-urlencoded option. Proceed to the step 9.\n\nIn Content type, select JSON (application/json).\n\nIn Request content, enter the request that should contain the following:\n\nThe grant type: client_credentials.\n\nYour Client ID.\n\nYour Client Secret.\n\nOptional: scopes required by the service.\n\nTip\n\nThe request example:\n\n{\n\n\"grant_type\": \"client_credentials\",\n\n\"client_id\": 4342c38243cb2o84732c234c\n\n\"client_secret\": 34sdf7843fno8s7dg\n\n}\n\nIn case you chose the Application/x-www-form-urlencoded body type: In Fields, add the grant type, the Client ID, and the Client Secret.\n\nRun the module.\n\nIn the modules output, you get an access token and a token type:\n\nAuthorize in the service\n\nAfter getting the access token, you can make the desired OAuth 2.0 request to the service using the same type of HTTP modules.\n\nIn the same scenario, add the second HTTP - Make a request module.\n\nIn URL, enter the a request URL for an endpoint you want to reach.\n\nIn Method, select the appropriate method for the endpoint.\n\nIn Headers, add an item:\n\nName: Authorization.\n\nValue: enter the token type you got in the output of the previous module, and map the value itself.\n\nNote\n\nIn this example, the token type is Bearer, but it may vary depending on an app.\n\nSome apps API require additional headers. Refer to the app API documentation to learn about the token type and headers.\n\nYou can make the needed request using the client credentials grant type.\n\nIn this section\nGet an access token\nUsing the OAuth2 Client Credentials grant with the HTTP module\nGet an access token\nAuthorize in the service\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Now, the list includes operations used to resolve incomplete executions. Plus, the Make API endpoint for listing scenario operations usage also covers these operations.\n\nApps updates\n\nNew apps:\n\nSuiteDash - We're excited to announce a new powerful CRM tool integration with Make! This highly requested app allows you to manage contacts and companies directly within your SuiteDash account. Now, you can automatically create tasks, projects, and update client information in SuiteDash based on triggers from other apps. Additionally, this integration ensures that data for contacts, invoices, and project statuses are synced and up-to-date across all platforms.\n\nUpdated apps:\n\nYouTube - We’ve added new modules that will let you manage your videos, channels, and playlists.\n\nSugarCRM - In the advanced settings section, we’ve added a new field API Version that will allow you to enter the version you want to work with.\n\nOpenAI - Introducing Batch Modules! Now you can work in bulk with our app’s functionality. We've added five new Batch modules and an Upload a File module.\n\nSmartsheet - We’ve added a new Search Rows module.\n\nBigQuery - We’ve added a new Get Query Results by Job ID module.\n\nJune 14, 2024\nImprovements and changes\n\nWe created new Make API endpoints to help you monitor the usage of operations in your scenarios.\n\nGet scenario usage: Returns the daily operation usage for a specific scenario over the past 30 days.\n\nGet team usage: Returns the daily operation usage for all scenarios within a team over the past 30 days.\n\nGet organization usage: Returns the daily operation usage for all scenarios across all teams within the organization over the past 30 days.\n\nLearn more about them in the Make API documentation.\n\nWe updated the timezones for operations and data transfer in your organization and team dashboards. Instead of showing usage in GMT+0, the dashboards will now display data based on each user’s account timezone.\n\nThe organization and team dashboards now include data from incomplete executions, covering both operations and data transfer usage.\n\nWarning\n\nIf your Make scenarios frequently have incomplete executions, you may notice an increase in usage metrics on the dashboards.\n\nPreviously, it was not possible to open a scenario in a new tab from the Table view of the Scenarios tab. Now, you can right-click on a scenario from the list and select the option to open it in a new tab. Note that the Table view is only available for the Enterprise accounts.\n\nFixed issues\n\nWe resolved an issue where, in rare cases, scenarios were running indefinitely and blocking the processing of webhook queue items. With this fix, scenarios will no longer get stuck, allowing the webhook queue items to be processed smoothly.\n\nApps updates\n\nNew apps:\n\nSage Intacct - This app allows you to keep accounting, staff management tools, and reports in one place. Within Make, you can handle records in your Sage Intacct account.\n\nGoogle Ads Reports - This app is an integral part of Google Ads that is responsible for marketing reports based on data in your Google Ads account.\n\nUpdated apps:\n\nCeloxis - The API URL for Celoxis has been updated, ensuring all app parts and documentation reflect this mandatory change.\n\nCustify - The app documentation has been updated with revised module names and improved structure.\n\nJune 3, 2024\nImprovements and changes\n\nWe added a new read-only Audience URI field to the SSO settings, where you can find the path to the metadata.xml. This can be useful for setting up SSO on the provider’s side. Also, we included a link to the documentation in the SSO settings so that users can access the information more easily.\n\nApps updates\n\nNew apps:\n\nCrossbeam - This app helps you find potential partnerships among your customers and identify account overlap to uncover new leads and boost your sales.\n\nwatsonx.ai - This AI app lets you generate responses to a prompt using a variety of large language models (LLMs).\n\nUpdated apps:\n\nFirebase Cloud Messaging - It was required to enter additional credentials to create a connection before. Now you can just sign in to your Google account to work with Firebase Cloud Messaging and enjoy!\n\nStripe - In the beginning of June, Stripe will deprecate all API keys that you used to create a connection in Make. To prepare for this, we created a new connection type: Restricted API key. Don’t forget to switch to the new connection type to continue working with Stripe!\n\nGoogle Chrome (v2) - We’ve released version 2 of our Chrome app to align with the new API, so you can continue to send notifications through your browser.\n\nMay 3, 2024\nImprovements and changes\n\nWe’ve added a small but important improvement to the Users tab. Now you can filter users by their role at both organization and team levels. Simply click on the filter icon and select the role that you would like to see in the list.\n\nFixed issues\n\nRecently, when searching for modules in the scenario editor, the Instant tag was missing from instant triggers and they were mistakenly labeled as ACID (polling) triggers. This issue has been resolved, and it now works as expected.\n\nApps updates\n\nNew apps:\n\nGoogle Search Console - This app provides additional online marketing support to monitor and troubleshoot your website’s Google Search results.\n\nFlodesk - This app allows users to create visually engaging emails for designing and managing email marketing campaigns.\n\nApril 18, 2024\nFixed issues\n\nWhen rerunning an incomplete execution caused by an error in a route in a router, only the route where the error occurred would be executed while resolving the incomplete executions. Any subsequent routes would be ignored. Now, all subsequent routes are also processed when resolving incomplete executions.\n\nPreviously, custom functions couldn't handle parameters with binary data types, such as email attachments or pictures. This caused failures when trying to process files with custom functions. We fixed it and now you can successfully use custom functions to process raw binary data.\n\nApps updates\n\nNew apps:\n\nTikTok Conversions - Introducing an app that allows you to track conversion events that occur outside of TikTok and optimize your ads accordingly.\n\nTikTok Reports - With this app you can create detailed reports on the performance of your TikTok advertising campaigns.\n\nBigCommerce - Using this app you can manage your BigCommerce orders, carts, customers, products, and blog posts.\n\nAzure OpenAI - This AI app lets you generate images and create transcriptions, translations, and chat completions.\n\nUpdated apps:\n\nLinkedIn - A new module, Search Organizations, has been added to help you easily locate organizations by vanity name or email domain.\n\nLinkedIn Matched Audiences - Four modules have been deprecated due to a LinkedIn API change: Attach a Seed Audience, Create a Lookalike Audience, List Lookalike Audience’s Seeds, and Update a Campaign Target.\n\nDocumentation updates\n\nSometimes things don’t work as expected and you might see some errors in your scenarios. To make it easier for you to handle such events, we rewrote the whole Error section on the Help Center to make sure that you get all the information you need to resolve issues. Go check it out!\n\nApril 5, 2024\nImproved app search\n\nWe're excited to introduce our improved in-product app search designed to help you discover apps and build scenarios faster!\n\nWhat’s new:\n\nImproved search speed and reliability.\n\nApps related to your search query show up in the app search window with added insight into available modules.\n\nYour recently used apps move to the top for a speedy build.\n\nThe new right-hand bar gives you quick access to common tools and functions.\n\nWhile creating or editing the scenario you see a new section in the list of apps called Apps in scenario. It helps you get quicker access to already used apps.\n\nIf you want to learn more or leave feedback for this feature go to this Community post.\n\nApril 2, 2024\nImprovements and changes\n\nManaging and rotating SAML service provider (SP) certificates became easier for the Enterprise customers. Organization owners can now activate, deactivate, copy, and download SP certificates within the SSO settings. They can also see which certificates are active. When it's time to rotate certificates, users will receive a notification from Make, giving them time to schedule the switch and minimize downtime.\n\nAdditionally, we’ve extended the validity of SP certificates to three years, instead of just one.\n\nTo learn more, check out our SAML certificate management article.\n\nWe've updated the banners that let you know when you've reached your operations limit. Now, when you see one of these banners, you'll get all the details about your upgrade options right there. If you decide to upgrade or purchase more operations, you can just click the link in the banner.\n\nFixed issues\n\nMake built-in functions that use timezone information, like the addDays function, didn’t work in custom functions. We fixed the custom function’s context, so now you can use the date functions in your custom functions.\n\nApps updates\n\nNew and updated apps:\n\nOpenAI - We’ve added some new functionality to our OpenAI app. Not only can you generate an image using OpenAI modules, now you can also edit or extend an image with the new module called Edit an Image. Don’t forget to include transparency in the image file, or a mask layer, to make sure that the image can be edited later.\n\nAnthropic Claude - We’ve added a new module called Create a Message. Also, we now support the latest model Claude 3 Haiku.\n\nZoomInfo - This new app lets you manage companies, contacts, scoops, and more.\n\nConfluence - Our new productivity app will help you keep track of all your Confluence content, including pages and blog posts.\n\nDeel - We switched to the newest API version. Make sure to use the correct URL with the new API version when using the Make an API Call module. Also, the Create a Record module now allows creating the Global Payroll Contract and Contact for Contractors types of records.\n\nTiktok Lead Forms - This new app with an instant trigger allows you to trigger a scenario whenever you receive a new lead.\n\nCohere - With this new AI app, you can create conversations and classify texts.\n\nX (formerly Twitter) - Our app has a new name to match the recent rebranding.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nNew documentation added:\n\nsendSMS\n\nWhen I Work\n\nScrive eSign\n\nTextbelt\n\nNozbe Teams\n\nFavro\n\ncodeREADr\n\nFinolog\n\nRelatel\n\nToodledo\n\nMarch 13, 2024\nImprovements and changes\n\nPreviously, you could only filter and sort scenarios in the Table view. But now, you can also search for specific scenarios using the search bar in the upper left corner. This option is only available to Enterprise customers.\n\nThe template guided setup makes sure you don't miss any important fields when setting up each module:\n\nIt grays out Continue until everything is completed.\n\nThe green success badge only appears when you click Continue for a module.\n\nFixed issues\n\nClicking the Details button in the webhook queue resulted in an error. We fixed it, so you can see all the data that webhooks received.\n\nApps updates\n\nNew and updated apps:\n\nSalesforce Pardot - Salesforce Pardot is a marketing platform for email campaigns and lead management. Our app allows users to manage their records, files, and folders in their Pardot account.\n\nHighLevel LeadConnector - A new Watch Events module was added. It can be used as an alternative to Watch Contact and Watch Opportunities. Also we switched to API v.2 for this app, making sure that the overall experience is better.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nNew documentation added:\n\nSendlane\n\nKlenty\n\nBlink\n\nArtiBot.ai\n\nFilestage\n\nBillit\n\nUseINBOX\n\nStannp\n\nZenler\n\nLuxafor\n\nMarch 4, 2024\nImprovements and changes\n\nDuring guided template setup, filters now have setup status badges:\n\n your filter has unsaved changes.\n\n your filter is set up and ready.\n\nFixed issues\n\nCustom functions sometimes took too long to finish, which caused an error and disabled your scenario. We reviewed the timeout settings on custom functions. Before using custom functions, check the limits.\n\nWebhooks migrated from the Integromat platform sometimes returned a ConnectionError. We fixed the issue so your legacy webhooks remain stable.\n\nIn some cases, domain verification did not work for SSO domain claim. Verification now works as expected.\n\nSharable links to templates went to the organization dashboard. These links now go directly to the specific template.\n\nSwitching from one team to another sometimes resulted in an error message. Navigating to a different team now works just fine.\n\nDocumentation updates\n\nNew documents:\n\nUsing the OAuth2 Client Credentials grant with the HTTP module: We wrote a new tutorial on using an HTTP module with the Client Credentials grant type to get an access token.\n\nUpdated documents:\n\nHTTP: We updated the guidelines for creating JSON Web Tokens and making OAuth 2.0 requests. Follow clean steps and use embedded functions that we prepared for you.\n\nApps updates\n\nNew and updated apps:\n\nLeonardo.AI - This new app helps you generate images using the latest AI art generator, Leonardo AI, a popular alternative to Midjourney.\n\nTickTick - Manage your to-do lists and tasks with this helpful productivity app.\n\nGoogle Vertex AI (Gemini) - A powerful new app that can answer anything with the Create a Completion module using the gemini-pro model, as well as analyze image and video files with the gemini-pro-vision model. This app is a replacement for the recently deprecated Google Cloud Vision app.\n\nNetSuite - It is now possible to trigger a scenario when a custom date field is updated. Use the Watch Records module for this purpose. Also, we added new hints in the Create or Update a Record module.\n\nWorkday Financial Management and Workday Human Capital Management - You can select the format in which to get a RaaS report with the help of the Get RaaS Report module. Also, we added helping hints to let users know where to get credentials to create an OAuth2 connection.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nNew app documents:\n\nCloud BOT\n\nConvertio\n\nDeezer\n\nDisqus\n\nFreelo\n\nGetAccept\n\nKintone\n\nLinkedIn Ads Reports\n\nOpenGraph.io\n\nQwilr\n\nReservanto\n\nRespond.io\n\nRocketReach\n\nSignable\n\nUpdated app documents:\n\nBeaconstac (now Uniqode)\n\nBooqable\n\nDropbox\n\nFacebook Lead Ads\n\nGoogle Ads Campaign Management\n\nGoogle Ads Conversions\n\nGoogle Ads Customer Match\n\nGoogle Ads Lead Forms\n\nGoogle Drive\n\nGoogle Sheets\n\nMicrosoft 365 Calendar\n\nNoticeable\n\nPipedrive CRM\n\nTimeCamp\n\nFebruary 12, 2024\nFixed issues\n\nIf a scenario contained an iterator followed by an aggregator, sometimes it would get stuck when processing a large number of bundles. The scenario then failed to create scenario logs. Now scenarios run smoothly and create scenario logs.\n\nImprovements and changes\n\nUsing templates to create scenarios is now much easier and more flexible.\n\nWe added an \"X\" icon that allows you to easily close the module settings. This means you can now open and set up modules in any order you prefer.\n\nWe introduced badges for each module to make sure you don't miss any important information:\n\n - a green badge indicates that all required fields are filled in.\n\n - an orange badge signals that you need to provide some additional information.\n\n - a gray badge reminds you that you still need to get started with setting up the module.\n\nOnce you complete the setup and all your badges turn green, you will see a side panel that gives you the option to run, edit, or schedule your scenario.\n\nWe renamed the add-on apps to community apps. In addition, on the Make integrations page, we show the number of scenarios that are using the community app.\n\nOn the Make integrations page, we show the verification badge for Make verified apps with their author and maintainer. This brings more clarity to who developed the app and who you should reach out to if you experience issues.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nNew app documents:\n\nDeel\n\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365 Business Central\n\nOracle Eloqua\n\nSAP Agent\n\nUpdated app documents:\n\nBasecamp 3\n\nFreshservice\n\nGoogle Cloud Text-to-Speech\n\nInstagram for Business\n\nSnowflake\n\nTwitter\n\nWordpress\n\nJanuary 29, 2024\nNew features\nDomain claim\n\nEnterprise customers can now claim and verify an email domain for their Single Sign-On (SSO) setup, allowing for SSO enforcement. Make recognizes users with the claimed email domain and prompts them to use SSO. See our article on domain claim for information on setup and provisioning options.\n\nImprovements and changes\n\nUsing a coupon for a higher plan now changes your subscription. Once the coupon expires, you automatically stay on your new plan. Or, you can manually downgrade to your original plan. See our article on coupons for details.\n\nFixed issues\n\nUnder the SSO option Default teams for newly created users, the list of teams showed deleted teams. This list now shows only valid teams.\n\nIt wasn't possible to delete records in a webhook queue: the Delete button wasn't clickable.\n\nThe infinite scroll in the scenario history wasn't infinite: it got stuck and didn't show all records. Now you have access to the full history.\n\nThe hints for creating names of custom functions and scenario inputs were incorrect. The hints now show the correct requirements for custom function and scenario inputs names.\n\nDoubled and unaligned texts appeared when you clicked the Create a connection button. We solved it, so you have beautifully aligned and correct texts.\n\nWhen you tried to resolve incomplete executions, the Run once button wasn't clickable. Also, a module that caused an error lost its mapping. We fixed both issues.\n\nMapping pills showed their raw name. Pills now have descriptive names.\n\nWhen you ran the Explain flow option and then deleted one or more modules, the dot showing the flow was stuck. We unfroze the dot, and now it shows the full flow (and takes into account the deleted modules).\n\nThe built-in option that Make uses to decode URLs in the output refused to decipher links. Now URLs in the output are legible and don't contain odd symbols.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nNew app documents:\n\nInstantly\n\nUpdated app documents:\n\nawork\n\nIntercom\n\nOpen AI (ChatGPT, Whisper, DALL-E)\n\nOutreach\n\nSalesforce\n\nTidycal\n\nJanuary 16, 2024\nNew features\nDynamic connections\n\nWith dynamic connections, you and your teammates use connections as scenario inputs. You can create a scenario with your connections, and your colleagues provide their connections to run the scenario. To learn more about how to use dynamic connections, check out the article in our Help Center. Dynamic connections are available for Enterprise plan users only.\n\nJanuary 11, 2024\nImprovements and changes\n\nA link to Make Community now appears in the sidebar Help submenu.\n\nEnterprise customers can now see their current subscription period and reset date on their organization dashboard.\n\nFixed issues\n\nThe list of users for both organizations and teams only displayed 10 users. User lists now include all members.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nNew app documents:\n\nIPQualityScore\n\nMemberful\n\nPingdom\n\nSALESmanago\n\nUpdated app documents:\n\nAttio\n\nBigQuery\n\nGoogle Keep\n\nGoogle Shopping\n\nGravity Forms\n\nKanbanize\n\nMicrosoft Power BI\n\nMicrosoft SharePoint\n\nPDF.co\n\nShopify\n\nSmartThings\n\nSquare\n\nTeamleader\n\nDecember 14, 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nThe link for the Resource Hub is now always in the left sidebar. No need to look for it in the submenus. Information and resources are now just one click away.\n\nA new email notifies you when you reach the limit on extra operations auto-purchasing. If you get this email, it means that you can only buy extra operations from your organization dashboard. The email has a link so it's easier to top up if needed.\n\nFixed issues\n\nPreviously, when you reduced the number of settings in the module settings window, it didn't automatically adjust its size. But now, the window shrinks based on the number of settings you have.\n\nWhen you were searching for an app to add it to the Favorites list, the search didn't show results. We fixed it: you can search for an app and get relevant results.\n\nAfter you tried to resolve the Incomplete execution, the diagram didn't load. This minor UX issue doesn't exist anymore.\n\nAfter you deleted a custom variable, an incorrect warning message popped up when you tried to save the scenario.\n\nThe Auto-align feature refused to align all modules in scenarios. Currently, it aligns all modules in your scenario.\n\nWhen signing in with SSO, Enter did not always work. It's fixed so you can stay on your keyboard when logging in and not bother with clicking.\n\nIn some cases, the list of organization members did not immediately update after inviting a new member. Invited members now appear as expected.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nNew app documents:\n\nInsightly CRM\n\nJobNimbus\n\nMixmax\n\nReamaze\n\ntimeBuzzer\n\nWistia\n\nUpdated app documents:\n\nAcuity Scheduling\n\nClickUp\n\neWay-CRM\n\nHubSpot CRM\n\nLooker Studio\n\nMicrosoft 365 Email\n\nNetSuite\n\nTally\n\nNovember 29, 2023\nFixed issues\n\nSome templates did not load values for arrays. Templates now display these values so you can edit and change them as needed.\n\nIn some cases, login failed with a 401: Access denied error. Login now functions normally.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nNew app documents:\n\nAtera\n\nFireflies.ai\n\nLinear\n\nUpdated app documents:\n\nCitrix Share File\n\nFreshmarketer\n\nGoogle Cloud Firestore\n\nGoogle Groups\n\nGoogle Tasks\n\nGoogle Translate\n\nLinkedIn\n\nNetSuite\n\nSlack\n\nNovember 16, 2023\nFixed issues\n\nWhen you import a blueprint, it now includes the scenario name.\n\nYou can edit Boolean values in Data stores.\n\nWhen you migrated from one zone to another (i.e. EU1 to US1), the Migration tool showed the wrong initial zone that you wanted to migrate from. Now the Migration tool shows the correct initial zone.\n\nTeam members who did not have a role and permission to delete members could see the Delete button. Now the Delete button only appears for team members with the Team Admin role.\n\nSeveral bug fixes and tweaks for Custom scenario properties:\n\nThere is now consistent behavior when adding and rearranging columns in table view.\n\nThe + Add property button didn't always appear. It now appears for all Enterprise customers.\n\nIf you went to the Scenario properties tab using a direct URL, you could not edit properties. It is now possible to edit custom properties after going to this tab via URL.\n\nTable view didn't always appear for Enterprise users who hadn't yet added a custom property. It now appears even when there are no custom properties.\n\nThe button to delete an organization sometimes appeared for users who weren't owners of that organization. Only owners can now see the Delete button for their organization.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nNew app documents:\n\nCircle\n\nFoursquare\n\nUpdated app documents:\n\nAbyssale\n\nMongoDB\n\nTeamleader\n\nZulip\n\nDocumentation updates\n\nError processing: we updated the list of increasing time intervals. This reduces the number of operations consumed when repeated attempts are made to execute a scenario with errors.\n\nChanging payment details and viewing invoices: we made changes to the information regarding what you should do when your payment fails.\n\nNovember 2, 2023\nFixed issues\n\nYou can now click on item pills to expand mapped items with subitems.\n\nThe Search items box in the mapping field didn't respond to user actions causing some glitches when you were typing or inserting text.\n\nDocumentation updates\n\nWe continue developing new documentation on Make, including errors. The 429 errors - rate limiting article explains how to handle this error, which appears when you reach the API rate limit for the app.\n\nUsing the On-premise agent: we added a couple of colorful and clear graphic schemes that explain the mechanism of the On-prem agent work.\n\nOctober 19, 2023\nNew features\nCustom scenario properties\n\nEnterprise customers can use custom scenario properties to help organize and sort scenarios. For example, you can add information like URLs, client email, business criticality, or anything else you like. See the Help Center article for more information.\n\nFixed issues\n\nModules that caused an error and had an error handler in the route didn't show a warning message.\n\nSeveral small UI fixes made Make more attractive:\n\nWhen renaming a module, you see all UI elements properly aligned.\n\nIf you assign a long name to a route, it is aligned in the Order routes window.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nUpdated app documents:\n\nAdobe Acrobat Sign\n\nCaspio\n\nFacebook Groups\n\nFeedly\n\nGoogle Drive\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nGoogle Translate\n\nRebrandly\n\nSquare\n\nTwitter\n\nDocumentation updates\n\nSomething new in Make Release notes: we made updates to some documents in our Help Center!\n\nFAQs: Due to the shutdown of Integromat on the 30th of September, we shortened the article and left only relevant questions. We added a link to the article where you can learn more about the current state of Integromat.\n\nIncomplete executions: We updated the procedure for resolving the Incomplete execution with another necessary step. The structure is clearer now, so it is easier to follow the whole process.\n\nOctober 6, 2023\nFixed issues\n\nWe tamed down our chaotic cursor: when you edit a formula with different functions, your cursor doesn't randomly move between the formula's elements.\n\nWere you confused by empty variable pills when mapping although they should have contained data? Don't worry, it was just a tiny visibility issue: now pills are full of color to show you that they contain data.\n\nWe get how frustrating it can be when a data store misunderstands your command: you wanted to edit a record but Make added a new record instead. No more confusion - you have your record edited and saved correctly.\n\nA module wrongly perceived an array as a string and didn't let you map the array's elements. We repaired this mechanism, so now the array's elements are available for mapping.\n\nAfter adding another module of the same app you already had in a scenario, it didn't pull up a connection for this app. It's not a problem anymore: Make now remembers the connection from the same app.\n\nSeptember 27, 2023\nFixed issues\n\nModules now handle different data types more gracefully. Data in all formats, from arrays to simple texts and numbers, are displayed correctly in the output.\n\nNobody likes an error, but when they happen, you need to know about it. We now ensure you have all the information about errors in your scenario logs.\n\nWe recently had an issue where Make was not allowing a new webhook to be created for the cloned scenario. We've fixed it, and now Make follows its own rules and assigns a separate webhook to each scenario.\n\nYour confidential scenarios are now safeguarded. Previously, there was a small concern with webhooks revealing data in their logs and queue. Now we have developed a fog-like covering for webhook's data, ensuring that it remains hidden.\n\nCalling all custom app users! Scenarios with custom apps can now be saved without any error popping up.\n\nThe clickable module ellipsis or three dots icon is back! You can now click it again to access additional options.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nNew app documents:\n\nAttio\n\nAlegra\n\nbexio\n\nCapsule CRM\n\nChatra\n\nDEAR Inventory\n\nDropcontact\n\nLinkedIn Lead Gen Forms - Events\n\nNetHunt\n\nPushbullet\n\nParseur\n\nRossum\n\nTalentLMS\n\nUpdated app documents:\n\nFluentCRM\n\nHubspot CRM\n\nOpenAI\n\nOracle Fusion Cloud ERP\n\nOracle Fusion Cloud HCM\n\nOracle Fusion Cloud Sales\n\nSlickText\n\nSugarCRM\n\nTwitch\n\nXero\n\nZoho CRM\n\nSeptember 11, 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nWe've made the router even sweeter by adding missing icons to the Order Route window.\n\nTreat yourself to a centered route name, so everything looks perfectly balanced now.\n\nFixed issues\n\nPreviously, cloning scenarios with custom apps and webhooks was like trying to clone a pineapple – it didn't quite work! We've cracked the code and now each scenario comes with its very own unique webhook.\n\nIf you needed to define a target structure type in the array aggregator, it got picky and showed the target modules fields selectively. Now you see all available fields.\n\nMake could not deal with migrated scenarios: they ran with an error that appeared without any reason.\n\nThe Migration tool refused to replace connections with ones created on Make.\n\nWebhooks had a strike and didn't allow you to edit them. Fortunately, we satisfied their requirements.\n\nMapping pills were stuck in the initial modules field, so you could not drag them to another field.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nA bunch of new and updated app documents appeared in our Help Center. Take a look and keep on building scenarios!\n\nNew app documents:\n\nAdobe CC Libraries\n\nCheckr\n\nCloudinary\n\nGlide\n\nHotmart\n\niLovePDF\n\nMailmodo\n\nSamCart\n\nUpdated app documents:\n\nBox\n\nBubble\n\nGoogle Sheets\n\nMicrosoft SharePoint Online\n\nNotion\n\nOnceHub\n\nWebflow\n\nWix\n\nWorkday Human Capital Management\n\nWorkday Financial Management\n\nYandex.Translate\n\nAugust 25, 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nWe made our famous router much more attractive to the paparazzi:\n\nYou can set the order of all routes belonging to a specific router. No more time-consuming manual work: do it fast and easy and visualize on the scenario canvas.\n\nManage all the modules that follow a router in one click.\n\nNo more cut app names in the scenario builder: you see the full application name under the module.\n\nFixed issues\n\nMake mixed error messages up, but we fixed it. Now if a scenario fails to finish the initialization, you see a correct message.\n\nLanguages unite people! The webhook output supports languages with the non-Latin script.\n\nModules don't erase mapping after you click Save.\n\nHTTP OAuth2 and Email connections pretended they were zombies: you could see them in the Connections list, but sneaky 404 errors prevented you from making any changes.\n\nThe Migration tool played a bad game with you: it allowed migrating data stores that exceeded the allowed size in your organization on Make, but you didn't see any warning message beforehand.\n\nThe scenario activation toggle played dead, but we breathed a new life into it: turn your scenario on and off at any moment.\n\nWere you wondering where your On-prem agent disappeared? Actually, they were always on the On-prem agents tab, but now they are visible.\n\nWe noticed that extra operations auto-purchasing got confused by yearly plans with monthly limits. The auto-purchase would not reset month to month. Now, extra operations auto-purchasing works as expected for these organizations.\n\nA couple of bugs crept into the template builder and made some edge cases where:\n\nmapped values sometimes disappeared.\n\nunchecking Use in wizard wouldn't save correctly.\n\nWe squashed those bugs so you can confidently use the template builder now.\n\nAugust 10, 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nWe're not going to stop making our features even more awesome: the list of Connected systems became more comfortable to use on your mobile devices. We've added a charming little icon next to the connected system name shows you if it's connected to an On-prem agent.\n\nYou won't have any problems with understanding what the () function does: we added a clear description.\n\nWhen there's something strange in your scenarios, who you gonna contact? We've streamlined our help ticket process to automatically include your relevant information.\n\nFixed issues\n\nWe tried a new insect repellent out and killed a whole bunch of UI bugs:\n\nNow the scrollbar in modules is always visible even if you stretch the window.\n\nMailhooks don't pretend they are webhooks anymore: they have the correct icon in the webhooks list.\n\nThe Show advanced settings button is in its place again: the custom apps using the OAuth connection always have it.\n\nAll the data is in its place safe and secure! After the scenario migration to Make, mapping remains the same as it was in Integromat.\n\nThe Refresh form button doesn't erase mapping anymore.\n\nThe filter settings window is not a spoiled child: it works correctly and appears without a random error.\n\nMake is a good diplomat: it talked with app servers and agreed to show available settings options in some modules that refused to show them before.\n\nWe believe in second chances. A small bug kept members entirely from your organization. Now, a member who's not on any team can't access any scenarios or data but you can assign them to another team without adding them to the organization again.\n\nJuly 27, 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nWant more features from the Apps Code editor? We've got you covered! With this release, you get IML functions docs when you hover over them. If you try that with a custom IML function, you can use the pop-up to jump to the definition of the function.\n\nFixed issues\n\nIt is easy to mix-up a comma and semicolon, but we keep an eye on that: the formatNumber function has the correct example with a semicolon.\n\nSometimes Make insisted on saving the scenario in the edit mode when you already saved it. We calmed it down: no more annoying pop-ups.\n\nEmpty custom variables seem so useless, especially in functions! The issue is in the past: all custom variables contain relevant values wherever used in the scenario.\n\nAll fans of the Integromat DevTool don't experience its failure on custom domains anymore.\n\nThe rise of the machines is canceled: Make doesn't prevent you from extending your connections any longer.\n\nTiny, but an oh-so important UI fix: the route menu is as beautiful as everything else in Make.\n\nWe bet you don't need buttons that don't do anything, right? Don't be surprised by the absence of the Refresh form button in the scenario schedule settings.\n\nLonger looks better now. We tweaked the UI so lengthy organization names don't look ... awkward ... anymore.\n\nYou don't have to automate alone anymore. We squashed some bugs that got in the way of inviting collaborators into your organization. Now they can log in and get into your organization without any issues.\n\nHolmes would be proud. We cracked the case of the missing mapped values. Those values are back in your templates and won't disappear when you create Make\n\nJuly 13, 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nEven more useful data in system variables: we added a new Is incomplete execution variable that shows whether the scenario execution is a regular one or an incomplete one.\n\nAnd one more lovely variable: Execution type shows the way the scenario was executed. Possible values are:\n\nRun Once: the scenario was executed by clicking the Run once button.\n\nAPI-Triggered: the scenario was executed via API or manually if the schedule is set up as On demand.\n\nInstant: the scenario was executed according to the schedule. The scenario begins with a webhook, and is scheduled for Immediately.\n\nScheduled: the scenario was executed according to the schedule that is set up for any option except On demand and Immediately.\n\nFixed issues\n\nWere you ever wondering why Make asked you to save changes in the incomplete execution when you didn't change anything? We understand you: no more irritating messages appear without any reason.\n\nWe fixed the mod operator description: it reflects the operator's work correctly.\n\nNobody likes filters that don't filter anything, right? That's not the case anymore: if a filter contains a team system or custom variables, it does take them into account.\n\nMake Migration tool doesn't ignore Make limitations in custom apps names' symbols anymore: if the name contains more than 30 symbols, the Migration tool won't migrate it.\n\nIt had one job! In some cases, extra operations auto-purchasing didn't keep scenarios running. We squashed this bug and you trust our amazing extra operations auto-purchasing without any worries!\n\nThe mysterious case of the vanishing connection! Our templates used to play hide-and-seek with your existing connections, but we've given them a crash course on detective work. Now, you can easily spot and leverage your connections whenever you use a template. No more disappearing, case closed!\n\nIt had one job! In some cases, extra operations auto-purchasing didn't keep scenarios running. Don't worry, we squashed this bug and you can rely on extra operations auto-purchasing.\n\nThe mysterious case of the vanishing connection! Our templates used to play hide-and-seek with your existing connections, but we've given them a crash course on detective work. Now, you can easily spot and leverage your connections whenever you use a template. No more disappearing, case closed!\n\nJune 29, 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nOur Apps platform is getting stronger by the day. Developers can now enjoy an editor experience with all the bells and whistles: IML syntax highlighting, context-based suggestions, app code validation, and code folding.\n\nFixed issues\n\nNo missed connections; we always swipe right for you. In some cases, creating a connection resulted in a Connection action timed out error.\n\nUmm ... let's double-check that. The System variable Operations left value did not always return the correct value. We've got that variable back to its reliable self now.\n\nThe webhook log won't leave you in the dark with empty fields. We tweaked the webhook log to let you know when the body is too big or complicated.\n\nRun once was accepted into the Olympics for passing mapped values. It did some extra training and now always passes mapped values to other modules.\n\nWe squashed some template bugs to be more consistent and reliable.\n\nIt didn't look right but it worked. Mapped values in blueprints now display and work correctly.\n\nCorrected some tooltips to uncomplicate some mathematic operators. Now if we could just math easier in general.\n\nJune 14, 2023\nNew features\nOn-premise agent (beta)\n\nThe beta is here for Enterprise customers.\n\nWith the On-premise agent installed on your system, your scenarios can access applications and databases on your local network. The beta version features a module supported by an HTTP agent app. See the On-prem agent article for more details.\n\nImprovements and changes\n\nWe organized the organization dashboard. Does that make it a reorganization dashboard? Reorganization-ception? We don't know but buttons and information related to your subscription and extra operations are tidier and more logical now.\n\nDeveloping a custom app, now in color! We remodeled the code editor experience and improved syntax highlighting, code beautification and a new save button. Keep your hats on, more incoming in the next release!\n\nFixed issues\n\nPolling triggers using the Choose manually option were not updating with the correct epoch data value. We didn't even have to poll all of you to know that this incorrect data shouldn't be allowed to stay in office.\n\nWe know you all trust us to get things right, so we made sure our type conversions were on point. When mapping an array with a single item inside, no more empty results when you're expecting some sweet text value.\n\nGone are the days of sad- and awkward-looking columns that wouldn't scale. I guess you can say they're making a bigger thing out of it now.\n\nIs it supposed to look like that?! No, nobody wanted our logo in the two-factor authentication QR code to look like a rejected rugby ball design. That's why we changed it making sure it still does the job of keeping your account secure.\n\nMay 31, 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nClearer hints in the Incomplete Execution to let you understand the functionality better.\n\nImproved privacy and data protection during registration.\n\nThe affiliate dashboard now has more information on migrated organizations to improve clarity for commissions.\n\nUI tweaks for customers using a coupon trial to make billing easier to understand.\n\nFixed issues\n\nDid you set up a fallback route in your scenarios and then couldn't find it? We've found the issue, and fallbacks aren't reset randomly anymore.\n\nThe names of custom fields in your applications are now shown correctly when mapping: no more confusing numbers.\n\nWe like short links, but not cropped ones. In webhook logs, you can see all the data in webhook URLs, as before.\n\nDid it seem illogical to choose the date range for scenario scheduling if it ran just Once or On demand? We think so. Date ranges are no longer shown in these cases.\n\nIn a few cases, links to the Make help center incorrectly went to the legacy help center.\n\nMay 17, 2023\nNew features\nSleep therapy?\n\nNot quite but you will sleep easier knowing your critical scenarios won't stop if you run out of operations.\n\nExtra operations auto-purchasing lets your scenarios keep running after you reach your operations limit. See the article for details on how to enable extra operations auto-purchasing.\n\nImprovements and changes\n\nA new beautiful button for creating a connection in every application you might need to build a scenario:\n\nThe results in the full-text search became even more effective: as usual, you have the most relevant data at the top, but now the most recent results go first.\n\nLiking the new plan? Put a ring on it! UI tweaks to make it easier to keep a plan from a coupon.\n\nThere are new options when creating a scenario from a template. You can choose between the guided setup or quickly creating a new scenario. Guided setup now lets you skip the guided experience at any time.\n\nFixed issues\n\nNo more troubles with the formatDate function: it correctly considers the organization's time zone.\n\nLet your data stores work properly: if you add a new item to the data structure, the system no longer messes up its type.\n\nFlaky is only good for pastries. The Users tab of the Teams dashboard did not always display all Team members. Don't worry, we made it accurate and consistent.\n\nIt's an older promo code, but it checks out. Sometimes, shortened URLs for affiliate links copied source information from older promo codes. We've fixed this bug to make your tracking more accurate.\n\nSpell-Czech didn't catch it. The Installed Apps tab of the organization dashboard had a typo. We caught it and fixed it so everything is clear now, assuming you understand Czech.\n\nMay 03, 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nNow a webhook can process all files it receives under the same key. But there is a little trick: you can find information about all the files in the collection named by the key, under the files array. Let's jump into an example:\n\nIn this example, the webhook received two files: image and image(1) under the picture key. Only the last sent file is shown in the picture collection. To see both files, expand the files array.\n\nBut don't worry: no need to urgently adjust your scenarios - you may leverage new functionality whenever you want.\n\nNo more issues with connecting to Twitter via OAuth2: use it as always! To start using the new Twitter application, just give Make your approval as an additional step - and it's done. Once creating a connection, click Yes, continue as shown in the screenshot, and then grant all permissions on Twitter's side.\n\nClearer hints in the Scenario Builder to let you understand the functionality better.\n\nUpdated logo in Upgrade Hub and Make Migration Tool: we're Make forever and ever! If you haven't migrated from Integromat to Make yet, it is the right time to do it with the help of our amazing tool.\n\nLong links are only good when we're talking about bratwurst, not URLs. Affiliates can now use TinyURL or other shorteners and still get information about the source of new users and organizations.\n\nNew address, who dis? You can now update your billing address when checking out. Just use the edit button and enter your new info.\n\nFixed issues\n\nAn iterator couldn't process variable values: now you have all data you need.\n\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA) became a little too excited and sometimes fully enabled itself before setup was complete. We had chat with it and 2FA promised to not do this anymore.\n\nAdding an app to favorites in scenario editor doesn't create an error message. It knows now that your favorite app exists.\n\nGet your inbox under control! We did some tweaks and fixes to the Email notifications tab of your Profile. Now you can count on changes being saved, the right people getting emails, and a more consistent UI.\n\nNo more mystery coupons! We've made everything clear in your organization dashboard to let you know when a coupon is active. Now you can find those details at a glance!\n\nApril 19, 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nYou can now remove yourself from an organization in two places:\n\nThe Users tab of the Organization dashboard\n\nThe list of organizations in your profile\n\nAffiliates can now enter longer links for their paypal.me and no longer need to shorten their link.\n\nFixed issues\n\nSome apps didn't appear appear in the scenario editor. Instead, a Module not found error appeared at the app's place without any reason.\n\nWhen deleting a custom variable, no warning message with the list of referenced scenarios appeared.\n\nThe base64 function converted the value in the wrong way.\n\nIt wasn’t possible to delete an incomplete execution. The Some of the executions could not be deleted because they are being processed right now error appeared, however, the incomplete execution wasn't in processing.\n\nA scenario execution was stuck in the Running status, however, it wasn't in processing.\n\nIf the scenario contained a webhook with records in its queue, and you added a new trigger module to the scenario, after running it, the new module was trying to process its queue instead of waiting for data.\n\nThe Users tab of the Organization and Team dashboards incorrectly displayed deleted members.\n\nApril 05 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nIn the Upgrade hub, you can see the list of organizations that haven't been migrated fully yet.\n\nEmail notifications for scenario errors and warnings behave differently. The first error or warning immediately sends an email. After the first error or warning, there is an interval as follows:\n\nErrors - Every 5 minutes, users receive an email with a link to their scenario history where they can access details of new errors.\n\nWarnings - Every 15 minutes, users receive an email with a link to their scenario history where they can access details of new warnings.\n\nThe Affiliates dashboard now has a direct link to promo assets.\n\nUS customers can now receive a sales tax exemption when applicable. The new process automatically adjusts your billing in the Stripe portal.\n\nFixed issues\n\nIf you had an array of numbers in the scenario input, the Set Variable module showed a Invalid value \"VALUE_NAME\" of variable arrayOfNumbers. Type number expected error without any reason.\n\nIf you used several custom variables in a scenario, but then deleted all of them and tried to save the scenario, the warning message didn't show all deleted variables used in this scenario.\n\nAfter setting up an app, an error bubble appeared without any reason.\n\nWhen trying to resolve an incomplete execution, the history showed the successful attempt without any error while it wasn't resolved in fact.\n\nWhen running the /data-stores/{dataStoreId}/data API endpoint without the exceptKeys optional parameter, there was an error.\n\nWhen clicking the Exit editing button in the scenario builder, the Not found error appeared without any reason.\n\nWhen creating a remote procedure for any custom app, you didn't see the connection name under the Connection section.\n\nThe organization and team tabs displayed deleted users.\n\nUsers could not remove themselves from an organization.\n\nMarch 22 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nIn the migration tool, you have all scenarios that can be migrated selected for further migration by default.\n\nFixed issues\n\nIt wasn't possible to save the scenario after clicking Run once. The Unknown Exception: invalid input syntax for type json error appeared without any reason.\n\nThe formatDate function didn’t modify the date according to the settings you set for this function.\n\nIf a module in the scenario contained a custom function, the scenario failed with the [object Array] could not be cloned without any reason.\n\nManual writing of a function’s notation in the module didn't work correctly.\n\nWhen approving a custom app as an admin, the Commit button wasn't clickable with no errors if you left the text field empty.\n\nThe apps environment for creating custom apps displayed incorrect redirect URIs.\n\nUsers in the United States Minor Outlying Islands could not migrate to Make.\n\nOrganizations with SSO could not invite new users.\n\nIn some cases, it was not possible to reinvite users to an organization.\n\nThe template editor gave errors during validation when it should not.\n\nDescriptions added to filters in the template editor disappeared.\n\nThe template editor's header was large and made part of the canvas invisible.\n\nMarch 08 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nAn updated version of the Make mobile app is available for your Android and iOS devices. This version features Make branding.\n\nA branded Google Sign-in button appears when you create a new connection for any of Google apps.\n\nWhen you use the following components in the scenario, but then deleted some of them, Make shows a warning message that contains information about the deleted component(s) once you try to save the scenario:\n\nData stores\n\nCustom functions\n\nData structures\n\nOrganization and team variables\n\nDevices\n\nKeys\n\nConnections\n\nImproved hints for some features.\n\nFixed issues\n\nIt wasn't possible to delete a user who created a custom function.\n\nThe Unexpected internal error was caught. Contact the support. error appeared in the scenario when there were no errors in fact.\n\nWhen the admin of the organization entered another organization that they were not an admin for, they didn't see the organization's custom functions (if any existed).\n\nIt wasn't possible to migrate a huge data store (around 2000 MB and bigger).\n\nCustom functions didn't work in filters.\n\nClicking multiple times on Buy extra operations opened multiple checkout pop-ups.\n\nIn some cases, it was not possible to add an ACH payment method.\n\nFebruary 23, 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nImproved hints for some features.\n\nFixed issues\n\nWhen you used notes in the scenario builder, the user interface had minor visual glitches.\n\nWhen setting up modules (including custom apps), text values in various drop-down menus weren't sorted in alphabetic order.\n\nIf there was a custom function in an iterator, its output wasn't clickable, and it wasn't possible to open the next module after executing the scenario.\n\nIn the scenario with the \"Flow Control tool → Module → Array aggregator\" scheme, the Array aggregator didn't show the name of the chosen Flow Control tool while mapping values.\n\nAfter deleting a custom variable and then executing scenarios where it was used, the warning message didn't contain the name of the deleted variable.\n\nThe Reauthorize button for some OAuth connections wasn't visible in Connections.\n\nIt wasn’t possible to map an iterator’s result to the module next to the iterator, if there was a Set Variable tool before the iterator.\n\nIt was impossible to restore the oldest version of a custom function.\n\nWhen using the Choose where to start option, it wasn't possible to specify a specific ID of the item to start with.\n\nThe affiliate dashboard did not correctly display the number of paying organizations that count toward affiliate payouts.\n\nFebruary 8, 2023\nNew features\nBulk selection\n\nBulk selection allows you to save time when working with any feature in Make that offers several options to choose from.\n\nImprovements and changes\n\nImproved hints for some features.\n\nYou can change your organizations’ country setting. Updating the country parameter does not impact language, time zone, or billing.\n\nFixed issues\n\nThe Reauthorize button for some OAuth connections wasn't visible in Connections.\n\nWhen setting up the scenario input, if you selected the Boolean type of data and set it up as No, it was reset to Empty after clicking Save.\n\nIt was possible to clone a scenario with custom functions to a different team.\n\nThe icons of custom apps were broken when mapping values between two modules.\n\nThe mapping process crashed the scenario containing custom functions and a bundle with binary data.\n\nIf you didn't find the needed app in the list of modules, the system didn't suggest requesting for a new app.\n\nIf the scenario had the Break error handler, and the scenario resulted in an incomplete execution several times, there was only one record for all failed executions in the Incomplete Executions tab.\n\nAll paying organizations can have up to 1,000 data stores, including Enterprise organizations.\n\nJanuary 25, 2023\nNew features\nCustom functions\n\nCustom functions allow you to extend Make's capabilities to work with data in scenarios. You can now write your own Javascript functions and make them available in the mapping dialog.\n\nLearn more about Custom functions\n\nNew enterprise apps\n\nThe following new apps are available to customers with the Enterprise plan:\n\nNetsuite\n\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365 CRM\n\nWorkday Human Capital Management\n\nImprovements and changes\n\nImproved the resiliency of webhooks and mailhooks, which are forwarded from Integromat, against DoS attacks.\n\nImproved availability of past invoices for download.

The build bots do it by parsing your HTML files directly at deploy time, so there's no need for you to make an API call or include extra JavaScript on your site. For more information, you can view the documentation on https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/#html-forms.\n\nCode an HTML form into any page on your site, add a netlify attribute or data-netlify=\"true\" to the <form> tag, and you can start receiving submissions in your Netlify site admin panel.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n<form name=\"contact\" method=\"POST\" data-netlify=\"true\">\n  <p>\n    <label>Your Name: <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" /></label>   \n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <label>Your Email: <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" /></label>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <label>Your Role: <select name=\"role[]\" multiple>\n      <option value=\"leader\">Leader</option>\n      <option value=\"follower\">Follower</option>\n    </select></label>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <label>Message: <textarea name=\"message\"></textarea></label>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n  </p>\n</form>\n\nTo create the webhook for Watch Form Submissions module follow the steps below:\n\n1. Choose the Watch Form Submissions module.\n\n2. Add a new webhook.\n\n3.

These four properties guarantee database accuracy and stability during transactions. See this article for more information.\n\nMake marks this functionality with a badge. Note that the ACID badge indicates the use of these properties and does not indicate whether the module is an instant or polling trigger.\n\nAction module\n\nYou can create, read, update, or delete data with an action module. Action modules are the most common type of module and can be at the beginning, middle, or end of a scenario. There is no limit to the number of action modules in your scenario.\n\nActive and inactive scenarios\n\nThere are two ways you can use scenarios in Make depending on how you want your scenario to function:\n\nActive scenarios run according to a defined schedule or webhook.\n\nFor example: to watch a spreadsheet or webhook.\n\nInactive scenarios execute manually whenever you wish to run them.\n\nFor example: limited, one-time results such as retrieving data for a specific time.\n\nYou can change between active and inactive whenever you like on the Scenarios tab.\n\nAggregator\n\nAn aggregator is a type of module that allows you to merge multiple bundles into one single bundle. Aggregators are useful in making data readable for certain modules or generating meaningful output. Make offers:\n\nArray aggregator\n\nNumerical aggregator\n\nTable aggregator\n\nText aggregator\n\nSee Also Aggregator article.\n\nArray\n\nWithin a bundle, data items of the same type are sometimes in an array. You can find an array by looking at the details of a bundle.\n\nDepending on the details of your scenario, you can map other modules to a specific item in an array or use iterators and aggregators to manipulate your data into other formats.\n\nWhen mapping, Make marks arrays with [ ].\n\nArray aggregator\n\nWhen designing a scenario, use an array aggregator to merge multiple bundles into one single bundle. This may be necessary to format data properly for subsequent modules. The array aggregator also lets you define your target data structure.\n\nSee Also Aggregator article.\n\nAuto commit\n\nThe Auto commit option defines how Make process data transactions. Enabling Auto commit switches all operations to the commit phase. In the case of an error, data commits immediately and you cannot restore any lost data.\n\nNote\n\nIf you disable Auto commit, no commit occurs until operations are executed for all modules. Only modules with the \"ACID\" tag support transactionality.\n\nSee Also Scenario execution, cycles, and phases article.\n\nBlueprint\n\nMake lets you import and export scenarios via a blueprint, a file in JSON format. Your blueprint contains all of your modules and settings except for connections. When importing from a blueprint, you must add your connections.\n\nNote\n\nBlueprints are not compatible between Integromat and Make.\n\nBreak error handling directive\n\nUsing a break directive lets you resolve errors manually and helps when you want more human oversight of errors. When an error occurs, the break directive stops execution of subsequent modules and stores the error in the queue of incomplete executions. Then, the break directive creates a separate record for each bundle that causes the error (available under the Incomplete executions tab > Details). Here, you can manually resolve the error and process all unprocessed bundles. The scenario execution history shows the status as Warning.\n\nNote\n\nYou must enable storing of incomplete executions under Scenario settings.\n\nBundle\n\nA bundle is a chunk of data and the basic unit for use with modules. A bundle consists of items, similar to how a bag may contain separate, individual items.\n\nClone module\n\nWhen you need a quick duplicate of a module (for example when using data store modules on each branch of a router), use the clone module command to make an exact duplicate of your module. It appears instantly and has the same settings and variables as the original module. You can then drag it to wherever you need it and customize the settings. Changes in the original do not affect the clone and vice versa.\n\nNote\n\nYou cannot clone the trigger module of your scenario.\n\nClone scenario\n\nYou can duplicate a scenario from the Scenario tab by using the Clone option on the drop down menu for the scenario. Possible uses include sales with multiple pipelines. Use Clone scenario to create a duplicate scenario and customize for each pipeline. Changes in the original do not affect the clone and vice versa.\n\nCommit error handling directive\n\nUse the commit error handling directive when you want to stop the execution of the scenario completely but still have the sent data. When there is an error, the commit directive:\n\nstops execution immediately\n\ndoes not process the subsequent modules\n\nignores all unprocessed bundles\n\nThe scenario execution history displays the status as Success.\n\nCommit phase\n\nCommit is the third phase of a scenario execution. If the operation phase is successful for all modules, the commit phase begins and makes all data changes permanent. This means that Make sends information to all the services involved in the operation phase about its success.\n\nSee Also Scenario execution, cycles, and phases article.\n\nConnection\n\nA connection allows Make to communicate with an app/service. When adding an app/service to a Make, you may have to create a connection between Make and that app/service to retrieve or send necessary data. Make asks for only the specific permissions required. As a result, some apps/services may ask for permission multiple times. For more information, see Connecting to services\n\nConverger\n\nA converger is the counterpart to the router module and merges several routes into one route. There is no converger module available in Make, but there is a workaround, allowing you to reduce the duplication of modules in different routes.\n\nSee Also Converger workaround.\n\nCopy module\n\nWhen working with multiple scenarios, use the copy module command to create a duplicate of your module that you can paste to any scenario. It functions similar to cutting and pasting text on your computer. Although cloning a module is faster, copying allows you to paste the module in another scenario. Copying a module will also copy any filters before the original module. You can also box select (shift + drag) several modules and copy them with the ctrl + C shortcut. This is helpful when creating complex scenarios.\n\nCycle\n\nA cycle is the operation and commit/rollback phases of scenario execution. A scenario may have one or more cycles (one is the default).\n\nSee Also Cycles.\n\nData loss\n\nThe data loss option enables data to be lost if Make fails to save a bundle to the queue of incomplete executions (e.g. due to a lack of free space). Enable data loss to prevent interruptions in the overall scenario execution, e.g. a scenario where it is imperative the scenario keeps running and the incoming erroneous data is not that important.\n\nSee Also Scenario settings article.\n\nData store\n\nA data store is a built-in database in Make .You can use data stores to store data from scenarios or transfer data between individual scenarios or scenario runs. Your account includes data stores, so you do not have to register at a third-party service.\n\nData structure\n\nWhen you create a data store, you need to create a data structure that formats your data store in Make. Think of the data store as a spreadsheet and the data structure as the headers. The data structure defines the kind of data (i.e. text, numeric, etc.) that the data store records. You can view and manage your data structures from the data structures page. You can reuse your data structures.\n\nData Transfer\n\nData transfer is the amount of data transferred through your scenario.\n\nSee Also Pricing parameters.\n\nDiagram\n\nThe diagram is a visual representation of your scenario and appears exactly the same way as you see your scenario in the Scenario editor. Use the diagram tab to quickly view:\n\nthe execution history of your scenario.\n\nthe amount of operations and data consumed.\n\nthe controls to manage the scenario.\n\nDirective (error handling)\n\nA directive allows you to control how Make handles errors. There are six error handling directives:\n\nRollback\n\nCommit\n\nResume\n\nIgnore\n\nBreak\n\nRetry\n\nExplain flow\n\nThe Explain flow button allows you to see how the data will flow through from module to module before you run your scenario. Clicking the Explain flow button  starts an animated visualization of how your bundles flow through your scenario.\n\nFilter\n\nA filter helps you select bundles that fit specific criteria. You can add a filter between two modules to be sure that bundles received from the preceding modules fulfill specific conditions. Make offers:\n\nBasic operator filters\n\nText filters\n\nNumeric filters\n\nDate-time filters\n\nTime filters\n\nBoolean filters\n\nArray filters\n\nSee Also Filtering article.\n\nFinalization phase\n\nFinalization is the fourth and final phase of scenario execution. The finalization phase closes open connections (e.g. FTP connections, database connections, etc.) and marks the scenario as completed.\n\nFunctions\n\nFunctions allow you to create complex formulas when mapping items. The functions available in Make are similar to functions in Google Sheets and those in other programming languages. The functions let you perform various transformations of item values, such as converting a text to uppercase, trimming a text, converting a date into a different format, and many others. Hovering over a function gives you a brief explanation and usage example.\n\nSee Also Functions article.\n\nHistory\n\nMake maintains a history of your scenario and records:\n\nDate that scenario execution started\n\nStatus (success, warning, or error)\n\nExecution duration\n\nNumber of operations spent during the scenario run\n\nSize of transferred data\n\nLink to detailed information, where you can inspect all data in that particular execution received and how the data was processed\n\nYou can view this information by clicking on history in Scenario detail or in the Diagram. Viewing from the diagram allows you to see currently running executions and stop them if necessary.\n\nIgnore error handling directive\n\nUse the ignore error handling directive when you want a scenario to continue processing the next bundles if an error occurs. The ignore directive does not process the bundle where the error occurred through subsequent modules. The scenario execution status is marked as Success.\n\nThe ignore directive is the default when you use a module instead of an error handling directive.\n\nIncomplete executions\n\nSometimes Make cannot successfully finalize a scenario execution due to an error.\n\nMake stores incomplete executions in a folder named Incomplete Executions. Each stored incomplete execution can be resolved either manually or automatically.\n\nInitialization phase\n\nInitialization is the first phase of scenario execution. During the initialization phase, Make creates all necessary connections (for example, to databases, email services, etc.). The initialization phase also checks if each module is capable of performing its intended operation(s).\n\nInstant trigger\n\nSee Webhook.\n\nItem\n\nAn item is data that is part of a bundle. There are several different types of items: text, number, boolean (yes/no), date, time, buffer (binary data), collections, and arrays. You can find these details by clicking on the inspector at the upper-right of your module.\n\nIterator\n\nWhen creating a scenario, use an iterator to divide one bundle into smaller separate bundles. Subsequent modules then process the bundles separately. One common use is when automatically uploading email attachments to a cloud drive.\n\nYou can find iterators under Flow control of the tools section.\n\nSee Also Iterator article.\n\nKeychain\n\nThe keychain helps you to administer the keys you have stored in Make. Each key is a unique identifier used for encryption.\n\nSee Also Keys.\n\nKey (data store)\n\nWhen creating a new data store, you can assign unique identifiers to each record. Make will create a key for you if you leave the key field blank. You can also map the value of your key to make it easier to find information in your data store.\n\nMapping\n\nMapping links the modules in your scenario. When you map an item, you connected the data retrieved by one module to another module to perform the desired action. For example, you can map the email address and subject lines from the Email > Watch emails module to Google Sheets > Add a row and create a spreadsheet of email addresses and subjects.\n\nSee Also Mapping.\n\nModule\n\nModules are the main building blocks of automation in Make. Modules represent actions that Make performs with an app. Each app typically contains several modules that read, create, update, and delete data.\n\nNotes\n\nClicking the notes button  lets you add notes to your modules in your scenario. The notes feature is very useful for keeping track of webhook links. You can also use notes to explain scenario routes, which is useful for teams working on complex scenarios.\n\nNumerical aggregator\n\nA numerical aggregator lets you to apply functions like SUM or AVG to numerical values. Numerical aggregator then return the results in one bundle.\n\nOperation\n\nEvery time a module in a scenario performs an action, it counts as an operation. For example, when your scenario reads a record from Pipedrive, writes a row into a Google sheet, or posts a tweet, each counts as one operation.\n\nMore examples that count as operations:\n\nRead data from an app or webhook\n\nSearch for data in an app\n\nCreate data in an app\n\nUpdate data in an app\n\nDelete data from an app\n\nTransform data using the built-in tools\n\nAggregate a row of data into an array or text\n\nIterate a row of data\n\nDepending on the complexity of the process you’re automating, your scenario can perform anywhere from two operations to thousands of operations in a single run.\n\nNote\n\nThere is a limit on the number of operations according to your subscription.\n\nDon’t worry about using up all your operations before the end of the month or year. You can always buy extra operations or upgrade to a higher tier plan.\n\nSee Also Counting the number of operations.\n\nOperation phase\n\nOperation is the second phase of scenario execution. During the operation phase read and/or write operations are performed:\n\nThe read operation obtains the data needed by the modules in your scenario.\n\nThe write operation sends data to apps/services for further processing.\n\nRepeater\n\nWhen you need a module to perform a task multiple times, for example make an API call, use a repeater. Placing a repeater module before another module makes the subsequent module repeat its task. You can confirm by inspecting the bundles output by the subsequent module.\n\nSee Also Repeater section in Flow control article.\n\nResume error handling\n\nUse the Resume directive when you want scenario execution to continue even though an error occurs. The Resume directive allows subsequent modules continuing processing as if no error took place. The Scenario execution history displays the status as Success.\n\nRetry\n\nMake does not feature a retry error handling directive, though there are two workarounds that mimic its functionality.\n\nSee Also Retry workaround article.\n\nRollback error handling\n\nUse the Rollback directive when you want to mark the error and return modules to how they were before the scenario ran. The Rollback Directive stops the scenario execution immediately. Then a rollback phase starts on all modules to revert each module back to its initial state. The Rollback directive marks the scenario execution status as Error.\n\nNote\n\nThis is the default behavior if there is no error handler route and the Allow Storing Incomplete Executions setting under Scenario settings is not checked.\n\nSee Also Directives for error handling article.\n\nRollback phase\n\nRollback is a phase that occurs when there is an error during the operation or commit phase on any module. The scenario execution stops the operation or commit phase and starts the rollback phase, reversing all changes in data.\n\nNote\n\nSome modules do not support rollback and operations performed by these modules are irreversible.\n\nSee Also ACID modules.\n\nRouter\n\nA router allows you to add new routes to a scenario so you can branch your flow into several routes and process the data within each route differently.\n\nSee Also Router article.\n\nRun Once\n\nOnce a scenario is configured, you can execute it by clicking the play icon.\n\nThis way, you can verify that the scenario runs as you expect.\n\nIf everything is working properly, you can activate the scenario. Once activated, thescenario execute according to its schedule.\n\nIf everything does not run as expected, you can visit our error handling article to learn how to handle errors.\n\nScenario\n\nA scenario is a series of modules that users create to automate apps/services. Creating a scenario allows you to transfer and transform selected data between apps/services via modules.\n\nScenario execution\n\nWhenever your scenario runs, it constitutes one scenario execution. Make marks the scenario execution as either success, warning, or error. You can find this information on the right hand side of the Diagram or on the History tab.\n\nIn technical terms, scenario execution refers to a sequence of phases. Execution starts with the initialization phase, continues with at least one cycle composed of the operation and commit/rollback phases and ends with the finalization phase.\n\nIt is possible to receive emails when errors occur by enabling email notifications from the email notification options tab of the dashboard.\n\nScheduling\n\nMake allows you to define when and how often an active scenario runs. Use the Schedule setting panel under the Options tab and choose Scheduling to set your preferred schedule.\n\nSequential processing\n\nUsing the Sequential processing options allows you to monitor and resolve errors in greater detail. If you enable sequential processing, Make stops processing the task sequence until you resolve all incomplete executions. With sequential processing enabled, you can address all incomplete executions in the order in which they occurred.\n\nIf you disable Sequential processing, the scenario continues to run according to its schedule with repeated attempts to rerun the incomplete executions.\n\nSee Also Scenario settings article, Incomplete executions article.\n\nTable Aggregator\n\nYou can use a table aggregator to create a table from multiple bundles. The table aggregator merges values based on your specified column and row parameters and outputs into a single bundle. One possible use is compiling blog posts or emails into a single email summary.\n\nTeams\n\nUse teams to control and separate access to scenarios and other Make data. You can assign users to multiple teams and specific roles on each team. Members of a team have access only to scenarios and data that belong to their team and role.\n\nSee Also Teams article.\n\nTemplate\n\nA template is a pre-developed scenario that you can customize to your specific needs. Make has made many templates for you to quickly create useful scenarios.\n\nMake also allows you to submit your own templates for sharing with the Make community.\n\nText aggregator\n\nWhen a module requires text in a single bundle, use a text aggregator to merge values into a single bundle. You can map text aggregators the same way as modules or other tools to create the bundle you need.\n\nText Parser\n\nThe text parser tool allows you to add these modules:\n\nMatch pattern - allows you to find and extract text matching a search pattern. Match pattern uses regular expressions, a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern. One example use is extracting email addresses from a document or the body of emails.\n\nReplace - searches for a specified value or regular expression, and replaces the result with the new value.\n\nGet elements from HTML - retrieves the desired elements from an HTML code.\n\nHTML to Text -allows you to convert HTML to plain text.\n\nGet elements from text - retrieves desired elements from text.\n\nTransaction processing\n\nMake uses transactional processing to describe the scenario execution cycle. A transaction consists of four phases during which Make creates or updates data in a way that ensures data integrity across apps and services. There are 4 phases:\n\nInitialization - creates all necessary connections and checks that all modules are ready.\n\nOperation - performs the reading and writing of data, retrieving and sending data from one service or module to another.\n\nCommit/rollback\n\nCommit - verifies all changes across modules and services and makes them permanent.\n\nRollback - when changes cannot be verified, the scenario ‘rolls back’ all changes, returning all data, modules, and services to their original states. The rollback phase protects data integrity in the event of an error.\n\nFinalization - closes all open connections (e.g. FTP connections, database connections, etc.) and completes the scenario.\n\nSee Also Scenarion execution, cycles, and phases.\n\nTrigger\n\nEvery scenario has a trigger, an event that starts your scenario. A scenario must have a trigger. There can only be one trigger for each scenario. When you create a new scenario, the first module you choose is your trigger for that scenario. Create a trigger by clicking on the empty module of a newly created scenario or moving the clock/lightning icon to another module.\n\nThere are two types of triggers:\n\nPolling -  routinely monitors a connected app/service \n\nInstant - also called webhooks that immediately execute the scenario \n\nWebhook\n\nWhen integrating with third-party apps/services, webhooks are a way for those apps to let Make know when something happens. A webhook is a notification containing data about an event, sent by one app to another app or site.\n\nMake uses webhooks as instant triggers to immediately execute the scenario. Webhooks create a URL that you can call from an external app or service, or from another Make scenario.\n\nPrev\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."
