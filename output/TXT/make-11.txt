Create an account on www.clickfunnels.com.\n\nAn already built funnel. More information about building your first funnel.\n\nAn established connection to ClickFunnels using a webhook.\n\nWatch the ClickFunnels integration video\nCreating a New Funnel Webhook\n\n1. Create an Make webhook and copy the provided link.\n\n2. Open the Settings in the funnel that you want to process data from.\n\n3. Click the Manage Your Funnel Webhooks button at the bottom of the Settings page.\n\n4. Click on the New Webhook button.\n\n5. Paste the Make webhook in the URL field.\n\n6. Select the event you want to watch.\n\n7. Click on the green button, CREATE FUNNEL WEBHOOK\n\nIf you select more events, for example, \"purchase created\" and \"purchase updated\" your webhook module (in Make) will be triggered twice after any new purchase.\n\nImportant to know:\n\nClickFunnels sends webhooks from each page. Even though it's only transferred to the next step, the action on the button says Submit Form. So, what happens if you use this button on different pages? ClickFunnels submits the form again, even though the event calls for creating a contact.\n\nThe solution for this is to put a filter to filter by page ID (placing the filter after the ClickFunnels' webhook module in Make) you can notice that duplicated webhooks come from another page with different ID:\n\nFilter example:\n\nTriggers\nWatch new contacts\n\nIf a new contact is created in the funnel then this module reads its data. The data can be further processed in the Make scenario.\n\nTo run this module, you need to add a webhook to the desired funnel.\n\nWatch new purchases\n\nRetrieves purchase data (product details, contact details, amount, etc.) when a new purchase is made.\n\nTo run this module, you need to add a webhook to the desired funnel.\n\nSample scenarios\n\nYou can find sample scenario templates with ClickFunnels modules here, www.make.com/en/templates/click-funnels.\n\nActions\nAdd Contact\n\nAdds a contact to a specified ClickFunnels page.\n\nPage URL\n\n\t\n\nEnter the required ClickFunnels page URL.\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\t\n\nEnter the name of the new contact entry.\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\t\n\nEnter the email of the new contact entry.\n\nClickFunnels\nGetting Started with ClickFunnels\nPrerequisites\nWatch the ClickFunnels integration video\nCreating a New Funnel Webhook\nImportant to know:\nTriggers\nSample scenarios\nActions\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

For example, RSS Subscription Extension (Chrome) or Feedbro (Firefox).\n\nYou can also find the RSS feed URL manually in the website's source code:\n\n1. Open the website you want to retrieve a feed from.\n\n2. Press Ctrl+U (Windows) or Command+Option+U (Mac) on your keyboard to view the page source code.\n\n3. Press Ctrl+F (Windows) or Command+F (Mac) on your keyboard to search the page source code.\n\n4. Search for \"rss\", \"feed\", or \"atom\" to find the RSS feed URL.\n\n5.

For more information, please refer to the Working with files section.\n\nTrigger Did Not Process RSS Feed Items\n\nWith websites that frequently update their RSS feed/Atom export, it can happen that some RSS feed items do not get processed.\n\nHere is an example: A news portal publishes 40 articles every day, but it only includes the last 20 articles in its RSS/Atom export feed. If the interval for processing is set to one day, then Make sees only the last 20 articles. Make does not have access to the previous 20 articles, and therefore, it cannot process them.\n\nIf this is the case, you'll need to set a shorter interval for processing the articles, like every 12 hours.\n\nIf this is not the case, and the article still has not been processed, it may be that the trigger has not yet reached the given article when being executed.\n\nRSS\nGetting Started With RSS\nHow to Retrieve the Website's Feed URL\nTriggers\nWatch RSS Feed Items\nActions\nRetrieve RSS Feed Items\nCommon Problems With the Watch RSS Feed Items Trigger\nTrigger Execution Failed\nTrigger Did Not Process RSS Feed Items\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

The WSDL URL usually ends with ?wsdl, but not necessarily, e.g. http://voip.ms/api/v1/server.wsdl\n\nIf the WSDL file does not display directly in the web browser, open the downloaded file in a text editor.\n\nSearch for the <service> or <wsdl:service>tag:\n\nOnce located, copy the URL from the location attribute.\n\nIn Make, paste the URL into the HTTP module's URL field.\n\nOpen the Online SOAP Client in a new web browser window/tab.\n\nPaste the WSDL URL into the WSDL URL field.\n\nClick on the Browse button.\n\nPick from the list of functions to the left, e.g. getLanguages.\n\nCopy the content of the Request XML text area.\n\nIn Make, paste the copied content to the module's Request content field.\n\nProvide values for selected parameters by replacing the question marks with actual values:\n\nClose the module's configuration by clicking on the OK button.\n\nExecute the scenario/module.\n\nSOAP\nSupported features\nWorkaround\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Ten je možné vytvořit na adrese www.sklonovani-jmen.cz/registrace.\n\nKolonky v modulech, jejichž popisek je zobrazen tučným písmem (ve scénáři Makeu, ne v této dokumentaci) jsou povinné!\n\nPřipojení Skloňování Jmen do Makeu\n\nPro vytvoření spojení mezi Makeem a vaším účtem Skloňování Jmen je potřeba zadat při vytváření spojení API klíč, který získáte následujícím postupem:\n\n1. Přihlaste se do svého účtu Skloňování Jmen.\n\n2. V pravém části obrazovky klikněte na odkaz Dokumentace.\n\n3. Zkopírujte API klíč, který vám byl vygenerován.\n\n4. Nyní v Makeu u modulu Skloňuj jméno otevřete dialog Create a connection.\n\n5. Do kolonky API Key vložte API klíč, který jste zkopírovali v kroku číslo 3.\n\n6. Klikněte na tlačítko Continue.\n\nSpojení bylo navázáno. Nyní můžete začít s nastavováním modulu.\n\nSkloňuj jméno\n\nPomocí tohoto modulu můžete nechat vygenerovat požadované pády zadaného jména.\n\nConnection\n\nNastavte navázání spojení se svým účtem Skloňování Jmen.\n\nJméno\n\nZadejte jméno, jehož tvar chcete získat. Může obsahovat více jmen oddělených svislicí „|“, v takovém případě bude vrácen seznam zpracovaných jmen oddělených týmž znakem.

Příklad: Josef Novák bude osloven „pane Josefe“.\n\nHodnota 1 na druhém místě znamená, že budou ignorovány případné tituly. Příklad: Ing. Josef Novák bude osloven „pane Josefe Nováku“.\n\nHodnota 1 na třetím místě určuje vypuštění úvodního pane / paní. Příklad: Josef Novák bude osloven „Josefe Nováku“.\n\nHodnota 1 na čtvrtém místě způsobí vypuštění křestních jmen. Příklad: Josef Novák bude osloven „pane Nováku“.\n\nVýchozí hodnotou je 0001. Obsahuje-li jméno vědecké či akademické tituly, vytvoří se pořadovaný pád z nich; přidává se úvodní „pane“ / „paní“; křestní jména se při z oslovení vypouštějí, příjmení zůstávají.\n\nNabízené hodnoty a příklady vrácených tvarů 5. pádu uvádí následující tabulka:\n\nČíslo\n\nMgr.

If you do not have one, you can create a Google account at https://accounts.google.com.\n\nMustache\n\nFor more details about the Mustache template system, please visit the Mustache official website.\n\nAdding a Mustache Module to your Scenario\n\n1. Click on the blue button, Create a new scenario in the top-right corner of Make’s Dashboard page or Scenarios page\n\n2. Search for the Mustache module using the search field\n\n3. Select Mustache by clicking on the module's icon\n\n4. Click on the Continue button\n\n5. Your scenario is now open\n\n6. Start by clicking on the white question mark icon in the center of your scenario\n\n7. Select Mustache from the menu\n\nTransformers\nCompile a Template\n\nMustache is a simple template system allowing you to generate output content from the provided template with variables.\n\nTo demonstrate what the module does, we will generate a short party invitation sent by email.\n\nTemplate\n\n\t\n\nCreate the desired Mustache template in this field. Use variables as required and close them into double curly braces {{}}. These braces are called mustaches.\n\n\n\n\nVariables\n\n\t\n\nNow you have to define the variables used in your text above. We have used four variables in mustaches in our sample template. These variables are name, date, time and place.\n\nSetting Up Variables in the Mustache Module\n\n1. Click on the Add item button in the Variables section\n\n2. There are two fields in the Add item dialog – Key and Value.\n\nKey\n\n\t\n\nEnter a variable used in your template. Do not use curly braces.\n\n\n\n\nValue\n\n\t\n\nSpecify the source of the variable. We have used the Google Sheets module, Watch a Worksheet trigger and have chosen the Events table from where to load the variables.\n\nWhen someone enters values into the table, these values will be used as variables for our Mustache template.\n\nSetting up a variable in the Mustache module\n\nNow, when the source of variables (using the Google Sheets module) and all needed variables in the Mustache module are set, we should decide what to do with the resulting text we get as output from the Mustache module.\n\nAs an example, we will send an email with our invitation.\n\nSetting up a Target for the Mustache Template\n\nMustache, as a transformer module, cannot be the last in the scenario.\n\n1. Add another module after the Mustache module\n\n2. It can be the Email module, for example\n\n3. Select the Send an email action\n\nSend an email action settings\n\n1. Ensure that a connection to your email is established (to establish a connection to the email module follow instructions in the Email documentation)\n\n2. Add recipients of the invitation in the To field\n\n3. Enter the subject of the email into the Subject field\n\n4. Add the Mustache module Compile a template action to the Content field\n\nThe result of our sample Mustache scenario:\nActivating a scenario\n\nOnce your Mustache scenario is tested and ready to use, you have to activate it.\n\nActivate your scenario by following Step 4 in the Creating a scenario article.\n\nMustache\nGetting Started with Mustache\nPrerequisites\nMustache\nAdding a Mustache Module to your Scenario\nTransformers\nCompile a Template\nSetting Up Variables in the Mustache Module\nSetting up a variable in the Mustache module\nSetting up a Target for the Mustache Template\nSend an email action settings\nActivating a scenario\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."
