You can proceed with setting up the module.\n\nSite\nWatch Form Submissions\n\nTriggers when a new form is submitted on the specified site.\n\nNetlify comes with built-in form handling. The build bots do it by parsing your HTML files directly at deploy time, so there's no need for you to make an API call or include extra JavaScript on your site. For more information, you can view the documentation on https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/#html-forms.\n\nCode an HTML form into any page on your site, add a netlify attribute or data-netlify=\"true\" to the <form> tag, and you can start receiving submissions in your Netlify site admin panel.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n<form name=\"contact\" method=\"POST\" data-netlify=\"true\">\n  <p>\n    <label>Your Name: <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" /></label>   \n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <label>Your Email: <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" /></label>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <label>Your Role: <select name=\"role[]\" multiple>\n      <option value=\"leader\">Leader</option>\n      <option value=\"follower\">Follower</option>\n    </select></label>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <label>Message: <textarea name=\"message\"></textarea></label>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n  </p>\n</form>\n\nTo create the webhook for Watch Form Submissions module follow the steps below:\n\n1. Choose the Watch Form Submissions module.\n\n2. Add a new webhook.\n\n3.

    "html": "Skip to main content\nMake Help Center\nRelease notes\nGeneral\nAI in Make\nAccess management\nConnections\nScenarios\nTutorials\nModules\nMapping\nTools\nFunctions\nErrors\nDevices\nApps\nGlossary\nCommunity\nSupport\nAcademy\nBlog\nAPI documentation\nmake.com\nMake Help CenterGlossary\nGlossary\nACID\n\nACID stands for atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. These four properties guarantee database accuracy and stability during transactions. See this article for more information.\n\nMake marks this functionality with a badge. Note that the ACID badge indicates the use of these properties and does not indicate whether the module is an instant or polling trigger.\n\nAction module\n\nYou can create, read, update, or delete data with an action module. Action modules are the most common type of module and can be at the beginning, middle, or end of a scenario. There is no limit to the number of action modules in your scenario.\n\nActive and inactive scenarios\n\nThere are two ways you can use scenarios in Make depending on how you want your scenario to function:\n\nActive scenarios run according to a defined schedule or webhook.\n\nFor example: to watch a spreadsheet or webhook.\n\nInactive scenarios execute manually whenever you wish to run them.\n\nFor example: limited, one-time results such as retrieving data for a specific time.\n\nYou can change between active and inactive whenever you like on the Scenarios tab.\n\nAggregator\n\nAn aggregator is a type of module that allows you to merge multiple bundles into one single bundle. Aggregators are useful in making data readable for certain modules or generating meaningful output. Make offers:\n\nArray aggregator\n\nNumerical aggregator\n\nTable aggregator\n\nText aggregator\n\nSee Also Aggregator article.\n\nArray\n\nWithin a bundle, data items of the same type are sometimes in an array. You can find an array by looking at the details of a bundle.\n\nDepending on the details of your scenario, you can map other modules to a specific item in an array or use iterators and aggregators to manipulate your data into other formats.\n\nWhen mapping, Make marks arrays with [ ].\n\nArray aggregator\n\nWhen designing a scenario, use an array aggregator to merge multiple bundles into one single bundle. This may be necessary to format data properly for subsequent modules. The array aggregator also lets you define your target data structure.\n\nSee Also Aggregator article.\n\nAuto commit\n\nThe Auto commit option defines how Make process data transactions. Enabling Auto commit switches all operations to the commit phase. In the case of an error, data commits immediately and you cannot restore any lost data.\n\nNote\n\nIf you disable Auto commit, no commit occurs until operations are executed for all modules. Only modules with the \"ACID\" tag support transactionality.\n\nSee Also Scenario execution, cycles, and phases article.\n\nBlueprint\n\nMake lets you import and export scenarios via a blueprint, a file in JSON format. Your blueprint contains all of your modules and settings except for connections. When importing from a blueprint, you must add your connections.\n\nNote\n\nBlueprints are not compatible between Integromat and Make.\n\nBreak error handling directive\n\nUsing a break directive lets you resolve errors manually and helps when you want more human oversight of errors. When an error occurs, the break directive stops execution of subsequent modules and stores the error in the queue of incomplete executions. Then, the break directive creates a separate record for each bundle that causes the error (available under the Incomplete executions tab > Details). Here, you can manually resolve the error and process all unprocessed bundles. The scenario execution history shows the status as Warning.\n\nNote\n\nYou must enable storing of incomplete executions under Scenario settings.\n\nBundle\n\nA bundle is a chunk of data and the basic unit for use with modules. A bundle consists of items, similar to how a bag may contain separate, individual items.\n\nClone module\n\nWhen you need a quick duplicate of a module (for example when using data store modules on each branch of a router), use the clone module command to make an exact duplicate of your module. It appears instantly and has the same settings and variables as the original module. You can then drag it to wherever you need it and customize the settings. Changes in the original do not affect the clone and vice versa.\n\nNote\n\nYou cannot clone the trigger module of your scenario.\n\nClone scenario\n\nYou can duplicate a scenario from the Scenario tab by using the Clone option on the drop down menu for the scenario. Possible uses include sales with multiple pipelines. Use Clone scenario to create a duplicate scenario and customize for each pipeline. Changes in the original do not affect the clone and vice versa.\n\nCommit error handling directive\n\nUse the commit error handling directive when you want to stop the execution of the scenario completely but still have the sent data. When there is an error, the commit directive:\n\nstops execution immediately\n\ndoes not process the subsequent modules\n\nignores all unprocessed bundles\n\nThe scenario execution history displays the status as Success.\n\nCommit phase\n\nCommit is the third phase of a scenario execution. If the operation phase is successful for all modules, the commit phase begins and makes all data changes permanent. This means that Make sends information to all the services involved in the operation phase about its success.\n\nSee Also Scenario execution, cycles, and phases article.\n\nConnection\n\nA connection allows Make to communicate with an app/service. When adding an app/service to a Make, you may have to create a connection between Make and that app/service to retrieve or send necessary data. Make asks for only the specific permissions required. As a result, some apps/services may ask for permission multiple times. For more information, see Connecting to services\n\nConverger\n\nA converger is the counterpart to the router module and merges several routes into one route. There is no converger module available in Make, but there is a workaround, allowing you to reduce the duplication of modules in different routes.\n\nSee Also Converger workaround.\n\nCopy module\n\nWhen working with multiple scenarios, use the copy module command to create a duplicate of your module that you can paste to any scenario. It functions similar to cutting and pasting text on your computer. Although cloning a module is faster, copying allows you to paste the module in another scenario. Copying a module will also copy any filters before the original module. You can also box select (shift + drag) several modules and copy them with the ctrl + C shortcut. This is helpful when creating complex scenarios.\n\nCycle\n\nA cycle is the operation and commit/rollback phases of scenario execution. A scenario may have one or more cycles (one is the default).\n\nSee Also Cycles.\n\nData loss\n\nThe data loss option enables data to be lost if Make fails to save a bundle to the queue of incomplete executions (e.g. due to a lack of free space). Enable data loss to prevent interruptions in the overall scenario execution, e.g. a scenario where it is imperative the scenario keeps running and the incoming erroneous data is not that important.\n\nSee Also Scenario settings article.\n\nData store\n\nA data store is a built-in database in Make .You can use data stores to store data from scenarios or transfer data between individual scenarios or scenario runs. Your account includes data stores, so you do not have to register at a third-party service.\n\nData structure\n\nWhen you create a data store, you need to create a data structure that formats your data store in Make. Think of the data store as a spreadsheet and the data structure as the headers. The data structure defines the kind of data (i.e. text, numeric, etc.) that the data store records. You can view and manage your data structures from the data structures page. You can reuse your data structures.\n\nData Transfer\n\nData transfer is the amount of data transferred through your scenario.\n\nSee Also Pricing parameters.\n\nDiagram\n\nThe diagram is a visual representation of your scenario and appears exactly the same way as you see your scenario in the Scenario editor. Use the diagram tab to quickly view:\n\nthe execution history of your scenario.\n\nthe amount of operations and data consumed.\n\nthe controls to manage the scenario.\n\nDirective (error handling)\n\nA directive allows you to control how Make handles errors. There are six error handling directives:\n\nRollback\n\nCommit\n\nResume\n\nIgnore\n\nBreak\n\nRetry\n\nExplain flow\n\nThe Explain flow button allows you to see how the data will flow through from module to module before you run your scenario. Clicking the Explain flow button  starts an animated visualization of how your bundles flow through your scenario.\n\nFilter\n\nA filter helps you select bundles that fit specific criteria. You can add a filter between two modules to be sure that bundles received from the preceding modules fulfill specific conditions. Make offers:\n\nBasic operator filters\n\nText filters\n\nNumeric filters\n\nDate-time filters\n\nTime filters\n\nBoolean filters\n\nArray filters\n\nSee Also Filtering article.\n\nFinalization phase\n\nFinalization is the fourth and final phase of scenario execution. The finalization phase closes open connections (e.g. FTP connections, database connections, etc.) and marks the scenario as completed.\n\nFunctions\n\nFunctions allow you to create complex formulas when mapping items. The functions available in Make are similar to functions in Google Sheets and those in other programming languages. The functions let you perform various transformations of item values, such as converting a text to uppercase, trimming a text, converting a date into a different format, and many others. Hovering over a function gives you a brief explanation and usage example.\n\nSee Also Functions article.\n\nHistory\n\nMake maintains a history of your scenario and records:\n\nDate that scenario execution started\n\nStatus (success, warning, or error)\n\nExecution duration\n\nNumber of operations spent during the scenario run\n\nSize of transferred data\n\nLink to detailed information, where you can inspect all data in that particular execution received and how the data was processed\n\nYou can view this information by clicking on history in Scenario detail or in the Diagram. Viewing from the diagram allows you to see currently running executions and stop them if necessary.\n\nIgnore error handling directive\n\nUse the ignore error handling directive when you want a scenario to continue processing the next bundles if an error occurs. The ignore directive does not process the bundle where the error occurred through subsequent modules. The scenario execution status is marked as Success.\n\nThe ignore directive is the default when you use a module instead of an error handling directive.\n\nIncomplete executions\n\nSometimes Make cannot successfully finalize a scenario execution due to an error.\n\nMake stores incomplete executions in a folder named Incomplete Executions. Each stored incomplete execution can be resolved either manually or automatically.\n\nInitialization phase\n\nInitialization is the first phase of scenario execution. During the initialization phase, Make creates all necessary connections (for example, to databases, email services, etc.). The initialization phase also checks if each module is capable of performing its intended operation(s).\n\nInstant trigger\n\nSee Webhook.\n\nItem\n\nAn item is data that is part of a bundle. There are several different types of items: text, number, boolean (yes/no), date, time, buffer (binary data), collections, and arrays. You can find these details by clicking on the inspector at the upper-right of your module.\n\nIterator\n\nWhen creating a scenario, use an iterator to divide one bundle into smaller separate bundles. Subsequent modules then process the bundles separately. One common use is when automatically uploading email attachments to a cloud drive.\n\nYou can find iterators under Flow control of the tools section.\n\nSee Also Iterator article.\n\nKeychain\n\nThe keychain helps you to administer the keys you have stored in Make. Each key is a unique identifier used for encryption.\n\nSee Also Keys.\n\nKey (data store)\n\nWhen creating a new data store, you can assign unique identifiers to each record. Make will create a key for you if you leave the key field blank. You can also map the value of your key to make it easier to find information in your data store.\n\nMapping\n\nMapping links the modules in your scenario. When you map an item, you connected the data retrieved by one module to another module to perform the desired action. For example, you can map the email address and subject lines from the Email > Watch emails module to Google Sheets > Add a row and create a spreadsheet of email addresses and subjects.\n\nSee Also Mapping.\n\nModule\n\nModules are the main building blocks of automation in Make. Modules represent actions that Make performs with an app. Each app typically contains several modules that read, create, update, and delete data.\n\nNotes\n\nClicking the notes button  lets you add notes to your modules in your scenario. The notes feature is very useful for keeping track of webhook links. You can also use notes to explain scenario routes, which is useful for teams working on complex scenarios.\n\nNumerical aggregator\n\nA numerical aggregator lets you to apply functions like SUM or AVG to numerical values. Numerical aggregator then return the results in one bundle.\n\nOperation\n\nEvery time a module in a scenario performs an action, it counts as an operation. For example, when your scenario reads a record from Pipedrive, writes a row into a Google sheet, or posts a tweet, each counts as one operation.\n\nMore examples that count as operations:\n\nRead data from an app or webhook\n\nSearch for data in an app\n\nCreate data in an app\n\nUpdate data in an app\n\nDelete data from an app\n\nTransform data using the built-in tools\n\nAggregate a row of data into an array or text\n\nIterate a row of data\n\nDepending on the complexity of the process you’re automating, your scenario can perform anywhere from two operations to thousands of operations in a single run.\n\nNote\n\nThere is a limit on the number of operations according to your subscription.\n\nDon’t worry about using up all your operations before the end of the month or year. You can always buy extra operations or upgrade to a higher tier plan.\n\nSee Also Counting the number of operations.\n\nOperation phase\n\nOperation is the second phase of scenario execution. During the operation phase read and/or write operations are performed:\n\nThe read operation obtains the data needed by the modules in your scenario.\n\nThe write operation sends data to apps/services for further processing.\n\nRepeater\n\nWhen you need a module to perform a task multiple times, for example make an API call, use a repeater. Placing a repeater module before another module makes the subsequent module repeat its task. You can confirm by inspecting the bundles output by the subsequent module.\n\nSee Also Repeater section in Flow control article.\n\nResume error handling\n\nUse the Resume directive when you want scenario execution to continue even though an error occurs. The Resume directive allows subsequent modules continuing processing as if no error took place. The Scenario execution history displays the status as Success.\n\nRetry\n\nMake does not feature a retry error handling directive, though there are two workarounds that mimic its functionality.\n\nSee Also Retry workaround article.\n\nRollback error handling\n\nUse the Rollback directive when you want to mark the error and return modules to how they were before the scenario ran. The Rollback Directive stops the scenario execution immediately. Then a rollback phase starts on all modules to revert each module back to its initial state. The Rollback directive marks the scenario execution status as Error.\n\nNote\n\nThis is the default behavior if there is no error handler route and the Allow Storing Incomplete Executions setting under Scenario settings is not checked.\n\nSee Also Directives for error handling article.\n\nRollback phase\n\nRollback is a phase that occurs when there is an error during the operation or commit phase on any module. The scenario execution stops the operation or commit phase and starts the rollback phase, reversing all changes in data.\n\nNote\n\nSome modules do not support rollback and operations performed by these modules are irreversible.\n\nSee Also ACID modules.\n\nRouter\n\nA router allows you to add new routes to a scenario so you can branch your flow into several routes and process the data within each route differently.\n\nSee Also Router article.\n\nRun Once\n\nOnce a scenario is configured, you can execute it by clicking the play icon.\n\nThis way, you can verify that the scenario runs as you expect.\n\nIf everything is working properly, you can activate the scenario. Once activated, thescenario execute according to its schedule.\n\nIf everything does not run as expected, you can visit our error handling article to learn how to handle errors.\n\nScenario\n\nA scenario is a series of modules that users create to automate apps/services. Creating a scenario allows you to transfer and transform selected data between apps/services via modules.\n\nScenario execution\n\nWhenever your scenario runs, it constitutes one scenario execution. Make marks the scenario execution as either success, warning, or error. You can find this information on the right hand side of the Diagram or on the History tab.\n\nIn technical terms, scenario execution refers to a sequence of phases. Execution starts with the initialization phase, continues with at least one cycle composed of the operation and commit/rollback phases and ends with the finalization phase.\n\nIt is possible to receive emails when errors occur by enabling email notifications from the email notification options tab of the dashboard.\n\nScheduling\n\nMake allows you to define when and how often an active scenario runs. Use the Schedule setting panel under the Options tab and choose Scheduling to set your preferred schedule.\n\nSequential processing\n\nUsing the Sequential processing options allows you to monitor and resolve errors in greater detail. If you enable sequential processing, Make stops processing the task sequence until you resolve all incomplete executions. With sequential processing enabled, you can address all incomplete executions in the order in which they occurred.\n\nIf you disable Sequential processing, the scenario continues to run according to its schedule with repeated attempts to rerun the incomplete executions.\n\nSee Also Scenario settings article, Incomplete executions article.\n\nTable Aggregator\n\nYou can use a table aggregator to create a table from multiple bundles. The table aggregator merges values based on your specified column and row parameters and outputs into a single bundle. One possible use is compiling blog posts or emails into a single email summary.\n\nTeams\n\nUse teams to control and separate access to scenarios and other Make data. You can assign users to multiple teams and specific roles on each team. Members of a team have access only to scenarios and data that belong to their team and role.\n\nSee Also Teams article.\n\nTemplate\n\nA template is a pre-developed scenario that you can customize to your specific needs. Make has made many templates for you to quickly create useful scenarios.\n\nMake also allows you to submit your own templates for sharing with the Make community.\n\nText aggregator\n\nWhen a module requires text in a single bundle, use a text aggregator to merge values into a single bundle. You can map text aggregators the same way as modules or other tools to create the bundle you need.\n\nText Parser\n\nThe text parser tool allows you to add these modules:\n\nMatch pattern - allows you to find and extract text matching a search pattern. Match pattern uses regular expressions, a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern. One example use is extracting email addresses from a document or the body of emails.\n\nReplace - searches for a specified value or regular expression, and replaces the result with the new value.\n\nGet elements from HTML - retrieves the desired elements from an HTML code.\n\nHTML to Text -allows you to convert HTML to plain text.\n\nGet elements from text - retrieves desired elements from text.\n\nTransaction processing\n\nMake uses transactional processing to describe the scenario execution cycle. A transaction consists of four phases during which Make creates or updates data in a way that ensures data integrity across apps and services. There are 4 phases:\n\nInitialization - creates all necessary connections and checks that all modules are ready.\n\nOperation - performs the reading and writing of data, retrieving and sending data from one service or module to another.\n\nCommit/rollback\n\nCommit - verifies all changes across modules and services and makes them permanent.\n\nRollback - when changes cannot be verified, the scenario ‘rolls back’ all changes, returning all data, modules, and services to their original states. The rollback phase protects data integrity in the event of an error.\n\nFinalization - closes all open connections (e.g. FTP connections, database connections, etc.) and completes the scenario.\n\nSee Also Scenarion execution, cycles, and phases.\n\nTrigger\n\nEvery scenario has a trigger, an event that starts your scenario. A scenario must have a trigger. There can only be one trigger for each scenario. When you create a new scenario, the first module you choose is your trigger for that scenario. Create a trigger by clicking on the empty module of a newly created scenario or moving the clock/lightning icon to another module.\n\nThere are two types of triggers:\n\nPolling -  routinely monitors a connected app/service \n\nInstant - also called webhooks that immediately execute the scenario \n\nWebhook\n\nWhen integrating with third-party apps/services, webhooks are a way for those apps to let Make know when something happens. A webhook is a notification containing data about an event, sent by one app to another app or site.\n\nMake uses webhooks as instant triggers to immediately execute the scenario. Webhooks create a URL that you can call from an external app or service, or from another Make scenario.\n\nPrev\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Follow the steps below to achieve this:\n\nCreate a new applet on IFTTT or go to an existing one that contains the trigger from which you'd like to send data to Make\n\nInsert the action Webhook - Make a web request. The applet should look like: If Your trigger then Webhook - Make a web request\n\nCreate a new scenario on Make using IFTTT - Receive data as the first module\n\nClick the 'Add' button to create a new webhook\n\nName your webhook and click Save\n\nCopy the newly generated webhook URL and let the webhook wait to receive sample data\n\nGo to IFTTT and in the settings of the Webhook - Make a web request action fill in the following values:\n\nURL: Paste the webhook URL obtained from Make in the previous step\n\nMethod: POST\n\nContent Type: application/json\n\nBody: JSON with data you want to send to Make\n\nExample JSON:\n\n               {\n\"Value1Label\": \"{{Value1}}\",\n\"Value2Label\": \"{{Value2}}\"\n}\n            \n\nThe JSON can contain an arbitrary amount of values. Value1Label is a label how the value will be presented in Make. {{Value1}} is an ingredient from the IFTTT trigger.\n\nTurn your IFTTT applet on and run it once. This will send sample data to the Make webhook which had been listening for data\n\nOnce the webhook receives the sample data, click 'OK' to continue and use the data received from IFTTT in subsequent modules of your Make scenario.\n\nComplete your scenario in Make and turn it on.\n\n----\n\nSend data\n\nFollow the steps below to send data from Make to a trigger in an IFTTT applet and run any IFTTT action using the Send data module:\n\nCreate a new applet on the IFTTT Platform (https://platform.ifttt.com/)\n\nUse Webhooks - Receive a web request as the trigger for your applet\n\nScroll below to enter an event name which you will need to enter when setting up the module on Make\n\nInsert the action you want to control from Make. The applet should look like: If Webhooks - Receive a web request then Your action\n\nActivate your applet.\n\nGo to Make and insert the module IFTTT - Send data to your scenario that shall send data to IFTTT\n\nGo to https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks, click 'Documentation' on the upper-right corner and copy your key from the documentation page\n\nClick 'Add' next to the Connectiondrop-down to create a new connection between Make and IFTTT. You will be requested to fill in the key obtained in the last step\n\nEnter the event name that you had entered when creating the applet on IFTTT\n\nLastly, map the data in the fields Value1, Value2, and Value3. These values will be sent to IFTTT\n\nOnce your scenario setup on Make is complete, make sure you save it and turn it on to begin sending data to your newly created IFTTT applet. Now you can use this data in subsequent actions in your applet to achieve the intended integration!\n\nIFTTT\nGetting started with IFTTT\nReceive data\nSend data\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."
