Scenario inputs are not available on the Legacy plan.\n\nSee Make pricing for more information.\n\nThe scenario inputs feature allows everyone to run complex scenarios by just filling in the required scenario inputs.\n\nScenario inputs allow you to pass data with a predefined structure to a scenario every time you run it. First, you define the expected data structure. Then, whenever you run the scenario, Make shows a form where you enter the data. The data from your scenario input is then made available to all modules in the scenario.\n\nImagine a new employee is about to start working in your company. You may need to create new accounts for your new employee in several different systems (e.g. JIRA, Slack, Email, Miro, etc). To create these accounts, you need the new employee’s name, email, employee ID, and maybe some other personal information. Without this data, you cannot proceed with the account creation. Once you have all the necessary information, you can start setting up the accounts for the new employee.\n\nTo automate this action, you can set up a scenario that will create new accounts for your new employee in all the different systems you need. Use the scenario inputs feature to define the input structure as the starting point of your scenario. You can use the name, email, and employee ID as your scenario inputs. Once you enter and save the employee information to the scenario, the scenario runs and makes all the accounts so your new employee is good to go! The scenario cannot proceed unless it has all the data you define as required.\n\nMoreover, you don't need to know all the complex scenario logic behind it and how the accounts are created in different systems. A Make expert can pre-build the scenario(s) for you. All you need to do is just enter the required inputs (name, email, employee ID) and the scenario will run. In this way, even casual users can run complex automation using scenario inputs.\n\nSome other cases in which you might use scenario inputs:\n\nSyncing information about a new customer in multiple systems\n\nAdding offline leads to the CRM, email lists, and creating a proposal\n\nCreating a new record/invoice/email/order by just providing a set of inputs\n\nWatch the video\nDefine the scenario input structure\nNote\n\nScenario inputs are available on Pro, Teams, and Enterprise pricing plans. Scenario inputs are not available on the Legacy plan.\n\nSee Make pricing for more information.\n\nNotice\n\nYou can define scenario inputs for your scenario before or after adding your modules.\n\nIn the scenario editor, click the scenario input icon.\n\nClick Add item.\n\nThe process is the same as defining a data structure.\n\nEnter the Name. This field is mandatory.\n\nWarning\n\nYou cannot use spaces or special characters in the name. You can use letters, numbers, and the underscore symbol (_).\n\nYou can only start with a letter or underscore.\n\nIn Specification, select the input data type from the dropdown menu.\n\nOptional: In Default, enter the default value you expect to get.\n\nIn Required, select whether this input is required or not to start your scenario.\n\nIf you select Yes, your scenario cannot run unless you provide the required input.\n\nWarning\n\nIf you have Required inputs, your scenario scheduling type must be On-demand. \n\nLearn more about On demand scheduling.\n\nIf you select No, the scenario can run without the specific input.\n\nOptional: If you selected Text, Array, or Collection as your Specification, in Multi-line, select how you want your text to show.\n\nSelecting Yes shows multiple lines of text to show.\n\nSelecting No shows only one line of text.\n\nRepeat the process if you need to add more items.\n\nClick Save.\n\nImportant\n\nClicking Save in the scenario inputs form interface does not save the inputs. You still need to save your whole scenario.\n\nClick the save icon to save your scenario.\n\nYou can use the scenario inputs as mappable values in your scenarios. You can find them under the Variables tab in the mapping dialog.\n\nTip\n\nUse Generate to generate a data structure descriptor according to your content type.\n\nTip\n\nYou can also define the expected structure of the scenario inputs via an API call. Learn more.\n\nThis might be useful, for example, if a third party integrates Make in their product and wants to generate a form for their users to pass data to the scenario.\n\nUsing scenario inputs\n\nOnce you define your scenario inputs, your defined scenario inputs appear as mappable values under the Variables tab in the mapping dialog. You can use scenario input mappable values in your scenarios.\n\nWith defined scenario inputs, every time you trigger a scenario (via Run Once or via API), the scenario inputs window pops up.\n\nThe scenario with scenario inputs can run only if you fill in all the required fields with the correct data types.\n\nEdit the scenario input structure\nWarning\n\nEditing the input structure item(s) in an active scenario might lead to data inconsistencies and scenario failure.\n\nNavigate to the scenario input icon in the scenario editor.\n\nClick on the item you want to edit.\n\nMake your changes.\n\nCaution\n\nChanging the scenario input name will cause scenarios to fail with errors. \n\nIf you need to change the input name, we recommend deleting the old item and adding a new one with the new name.\n\nCaution\n\nIf you change the inputs from not required to required, you need to change your scheduling to On-demand.\n\nLearn more about On demand scheduling.\n\nClick Save.\n\nOnce you save your changes, the changes update automatically everywhere you use the specific input mappable value. This does not refer to the scenario input name (see above).\n\nDelete items in the scenario input structure\nWarning\n\nDeleting the input structure item(s) in the active scenario might lead to data inconsistencies and scenario failure.\n\nTo delete an item from an input structure, navigate to the scenario input icon in the scenario editor.\n\nFind an item you want to delete.\n\nClick X to delete the item.\n\nTo delete all items, click X for all of the items.\n\nClick Save to save your changes.\n\nRelated APIs\n\nThe Make API allows you to define scenario inputs programmatically, as well as use the API to pass input values to a scenario and run it.\n\nIn the API, the definition of scenario inputs is called scenario interface.\n\nYou can also use the Run a scenario module of the Make app. Check the Make app documentation.\n\nThe following endpoints are available:\n\nGet scenario interface\n\nUpdate scenario interface\n\nExecute scenario\n\nIn this section\nWatch the video\nDefine the scenario input structure\nUsing scenario inputs\nEdit the scenario input structure\nDelete items in the scenario input structure\nRelated APIs\nScenario inputs\nWatch the video\nDefine the scenario input structure\nUsing scenario inputs\nEdit the scenario input structure\nDelete items in the scenario input structure\nRelated APIs\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Filters will help you to select those bundles.\n\nYou can add a filter between two modules and check whether bundles received from the preceding modules fulfill specific filter conditions or not. If yes, the bundles will be passed on to the next module in the scenario. If not, their processing will be terminated.\n\nFor example, if you want to create a scenario with the Facebook trigger Watch posts and you want to work only with posts containing a specific word or posts written by a specific author, a filter would make sure you receive only these posts and nothing else.\n\nAdding a filter\n\nTo add a filter between two modules, click on the connecting line between them.\n\nThis brings up a panel where you can enter the name for the filter that is to be created and define one or more filter conditions.\n\nFor each condition, you can enter one or two operands and an operator that will determine the relation between them. In the operand field, you can enter values in the same way as you would map them.\n\nIn the example above, you can see how to connect the Gmail trigger Watch emails and the Google Drive action Upload a file. The filter automatically applies the condition to incoming bundles from the first module and only bundles containing attachments are allowed to pass on to the next module.\n\nOperators\n\nFor each condition, you can use one of several different operators.\n\nBasic operators\n\nExists - checks whether a specific bundle item is filled in. Using this operator, you can create a filter that permits, for example, only Facebook posts that contain a photo to go through to the next module in a scenario.\n\nNot exists - the opposite of exists. It permits only those bundles where a specific item is not filled in.\n\nOther operators\n\nThere are a number of other operators you can use: text comparison operators, numerical operators, time and date operators, and operators for working with arrays.\n\nCopying a filter\n\nCopying filters is currently not natively supported by the Scenario editor, though if you use the Google Chrome web browser, the following workaround can be employed:\n\nInstall Make DevTool Chrome extension.\n\nIn Make, open your scenario.\n\nIn Chrome, open the Developer tools. You can do so either by choosing the Developer tools command from the the Chrome main menu or just press Ctrl+Shift+I or F12:\n\nIn the Developer tools, click on the Make tab.\n\nClick on the Tools icon in the left side bar.\n\n.Click on the Copy filter tool and configure it in the right side panel.\n\nSet the Source Module field - the module that's right after the filter you wish to copy.\n\nSet the Target Module field - the module before which you wish to copy the filter.\n\nClick on the Run button.\n\nIn this section\nAdding a filter\nOperators\nCopying a filter\nFiltering\nAdding a filter\nOperators\nBasic operators\nOther operators\nCopying a filter\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Depending on how you want to use your scenario, you will either activate or inactivate yourscenario.\n\nActive scenarios run periodically according to their defined schedule\n\nInactive scenarios are executed once and whenever you wish to run them\n\nYou may change between the two statuses whenever you like (active scenarios can become inactive and vice versa).\n\nWhy activate? Why inactivate?\n\nThere are specific purposes for activating your scenarios as well as other reasons for making your scenarios inactive.\n\nUsing the example of connecting Instagram to Dropbox, you want to activate your scenario when you are wanting to consistently watch your account on a long-term basis. In this case, whenever you add a photo, it will automatically upload this photo to Dropbox. It will do so according to its schedule.\n\nOn the other hand, the inactive scenario is great for when you simply want to select photos from a specific time interval. Clicking the Run once icon in the scenario editor will start a one-time execution of the scenario.\n\nHow to activate\n\nA newly created scenario is, by default, inactive.

A scenario comprises of a series of modules that indicate how data should be transferred and transformed between apps/services.\n\nThere are 4 steps to creating a scenario:\n\nChoose your apps\n\nBuild your scenario\n\nTest your scenario\n\nActivate your scenario\n\nExample: Add new incoming emails to a Google Sheet as a new row\n\nTo exemplify how to create a scenario, we will go through the process step-by-step. In our example scenario, we are adding new incoming emails to a Google Sheets spreadsheet as a new row.\n\nNote\n\nBefore you begin creating any scenario, ensure you are signed in to your Make account.\n\nStep 1: Choose your apps\n\nGo to your organization dashboard and click Create a new scenario button.\n\nYou can also go to Scenarios > Create a new scenario .\n\nClick the plus icon. A list of apps appears. In the search field, search for the app you want to use. In this case, search for Email.\n\nStep 2: Build your scenario\nAdd Email module\n\nSelect the folder whose emails you want to watch.\n\nGo to Scenarios > Create a new scenario\n\nAdd Email > Watch email module.\n\nCreate a connection to your email.\n\nSelect the folder whose emails you want to watch.\n\nSelect the criteria of the emails you want to watch from the dropdown menu.\n\n(optional)\n\nSpecify if you want to watch emails from a specific email address, emails that contain a specific phrase, etc.\n\nClick OK to save.\n\nA pop-up appears. Choose from when to want to start watching emails.\n\nClick OK to save.\n\nAdd Google Sheets > Add a row module\n\nHover over the right part of the Email module. The plus sign appears.\n\nClick Add another module. An empty module appears.\n\nSearch for and click the module you want. In this case, select Google Sheets > Add a row module.\n\nCreate a connection to your Google account.\n\nUnder Choose a method, select whether you want to select your spreadsheet from the list or manually.\n\nUnder Choose a Drive, select your drive.\n\nIn Spreadsheet ID, select your spreadsheet.\n\nIf your spreadsheet is in the folder, first select the folder. Then, click the plus sign to select the specific spreadsheet in the folder.\n\nSelect the sheet name.\n\nSelect whether your table contains headers. Our table contains headers, but yours doesn't have to.\n\nIn values, map the data you want to get in your spreadsheet.\n\nIf your table has headers you will see the header names before the letter in brackets.\n\nClick OK to save.\n\nNote\n\nFor more robust scenarios, repeat the same steps as in Step 2 until you add all the modules you want.\n\nStep 3: Test your scenario\n\nBefore you activate and schedule your scenario, you should test your scenario to check if everything is working properly.\n\nClick the Run once button to test your scenario.\n\nBubbles appear on top of the modules, which gives you information about the processed data, or what is referred to as bundles.\n\nClick the number to display the information about the processed bundles, including the number of operations. By clicking the individual operations, you can see which module settings were used and which bundles were returned by which module.\n\nFor more information, see the Execution flow section.\n\nTesting your scenario is vital for seeing how data flows through your scenario. It also helps to show if there are any errors in your scenario.\n\nNote\n\nIf you encounter an error for any scenario, see our Error processing section.\n\nStep 4: Schedule and activate your scenario\n\nYour scenario is almost ready to run, but it's still inactive.\n\nTo schedule your scenarios, click on the Schedule setting.\n\nSet how often you want your scenario to run.\n\nClick OK to save.\n\nTo activate your scenario, exit the scenario editor by hitting the arrow icon in the top-left corner, as shown in the animation below.\n\nClick the ON/OFF button to activate your scenario and setting up the schedule.\n\nOnce activated, your scenario will run according to its schedule.\n\nFor further details on Scenario editor, please visit our Scenario editor documentation.\n\nImportant terms\nScenario activation\n\nScenarios are active or inactive. You can change the scenario status by clicking the ON/OFF button in the scenario detail.\n\nScenario schedule\n\nActive scenarios execute according to a schedule. See Scheduling a scenario.\n\nScenario name\n\nTo rename your scenario, click on the scenario's name in the top left corner. Press ENTER or click outside the edited field to save the new scenario name.\n\nSelecting the first bundle\n\nTriggers allow you to select the first bundle that you want to process in the scenario. See Selecting the first bundle.\n\nNumber of returned bundles\n\nModules, by default, always return only two bundles. You can change this in the module settings field Maximum number of returned bundles.\n\nAdvanced scenario settings\n\nMake allows you to configure a number of other advanced settings. See Scenario settings.\n\nIn this section\nExample: Add new incoming emails to a Google Sheet as a new row\nImportant terms\nCreating a scenario\nExample: Add new incoming emails to a Google Sheet as a new row\nStep 1: Choose your apps\nStep 2: Build your scenario\nStep 3: Test your scenario\nStep 4: Schedule and activate your scenario\nImportant terms\nScenario activation\nScenario schedule\nScenario name\nSelecting the first bundle\nNumber of returned bundles\nAdvanced scenario settings\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Here you can set various advanced settings.\n\n1 - Sequential processing\n\nYou can allow Make to store information about incomplete scenario executions.\n\nThe sequential processing setting determines how Make processes recurring incomplete scenario executions. The Incomplete executions folder must contain scenario data.\n\nIf enabled, Make stops executing the scenario until you resolve all incomplete executions. This option guarantees that Make will always solve incomplete executions in sequential order.\n\nIf disabled, the scenario continues to run according to its schedule, regardless of errors.\n\nNote\n\nSequential processing also applies to webhooks. By default, Make processes webhooks in parallel. When you enable sequential processing, Make waits until the previous execution is complete before starting the next one.\n\nSee webhooks for more information.\n\n2 - Data is confidential\n\nAfter a scenario executes, you can display information about data processed by the modules. This happens by default.\n\nIf you do not want to store this information, enable the data is confidential setting.\n\nCaution\n\nIf enabled, there are very limited options to solve errors that occur in a scenario execution.\n\n3 - Allow storing of incomplete executions\n\nThis setting determines what happens if a scenario run encounters an error. You can choose how Make will process the data.\n\nIf enabled, the scenario is paused and moved to the Incomplete executions folder. This gives you the possibility to fix the issue and continue executing from where the scenario stopped.\n\nIf disabled, the scenario run stops and starts a rollback phase.\n\nYou can resolve each incomplete execution either manually or automatically.\n\nNote\n\nThe data in this folder counts towards the storage limits of your subscription plan.\n\n4 - Enable data loss\n\nMake may fail to save a data bundle to the queue of incomplete executions (e.g. due to a lack of free space). With this setting enabled, Make does not save the lost data. This is to prevent interruptions in the scenario execution.\n\nThis option is well-suited for scenarios where continuous execution is the highest priority. The incoming data is less important.\n\nScenario modules can encounter files larger than the maximum allowed size. In this case, Make proceeds according to the enable data loss setting and displays a warning message.\n\nNote\n\nThe maximum file size depends on your subscription plan.\n\n5 - Auto commit\n\nThis setting applies to transactions and defines the way to process a scenario. This setting is enabled by default.\n\nIf enabled, the commit phase on each module starts immediately after the operation phase. Data is committed right away and cannot be restored in the case of an error.\n\nIf disabled, no commit occurs until operations are executed for all modules.\n\nNote\n\nNot every module supports transactionality. Only modules marked with the tag 'ACID' support transactions.\n\n6 - Commit trigger last\n\nThis setting defines the module commit order after a successful scenario operation phase. This setting is enabled by default.\n\nIf enabled, the commit phase skips the trigger and processes that module last.\n\nIf disabled, the commit phase occurs in the default order.\n\n7 - Max number of cycles\n\nThis setting defines the maximum number of cycles allowed during a scenario execution.\n\nSetting more cycles can be useful when you want to prevent connection interruption to third-party services. This can also ensure all records are processed within the scenario run.\n\nIf you execute the scenario manually by clicking the Run once button, the setting is ignored and only one cycle will be performed.\n\nExample\n\nDropbox > Watch files retrieve files added to a folder and the Google Sheets > Add a Row module inserts the file name and file size to a new row in the sheet.\n\nMax number of cycles is set to 1 (default)\n\nThe Limit field in the Dropbox > Watch files module is set to 10.\n\nIf 100 files are added to the Dropbox folder and the Limit field is set to 10 then 90 files will be left unprocessed after one scenario run. The next 10 files will be processed in the next scheduled scenario execution.\n\nMax number of cycles is set to 10\n\nAs before, the Limit field in the Dropbox > Watch files module is set to 10.\n\nIf 100 files are added to the Dropbox folder and the Limit field option is set to 10 then 10 files will be processed during the first cycle, the next 10 files in the second cycle, the next 10 files in the third cycle, and so on, until all files are processed.\n\nAll files are processed within the one scenario run.\n\nYou can see the already run cycles in the scenario run details.\n\n8 - Number of consecutive errors\n\nThis setting defines the maximum number of consecutive execution attempts before the scenario deactivates (excluding DataError, DuplicateDataError and ConnectionError).\n\nNote\n\nIf a scenario starts with an instant trigger, the setting is ignored and the scenario is deactivated immediately once the first error has occurred.\n\nIn this section\n1 - Sequential processing\n2 - Data is confidential\n3 - Allow storing of incomplete executions\n4 - Enable data loss\n5 - Auto commit\n6 - Commit trigger last\n7 - Max number of cycles\n8 - Number of consecutive errors\nScenario settings\n1 - Sequential processing\n2 - Data is confidential\n3 - Allow storing of incomplete executions\n4 - Enable data loss\n5 - Auto commit\n6 - Commit trigger last\n7 - Max number of cycles\nExample\n8 - Number of consecutive errors\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

The full version will come later. We would like to encourage you to provide us with your feedback in Make Community, so we will be able to improve the On-prem agent feature and make it comfortable for you to work with.\n\nThe On-prem agent is available only on the Enterprise plan.\n\nThe general On-prem agent architecture:\n\nOne On-prem agent can connect to many applications that are located in the same network. Currently, we provide an HTTP Agent app that allows connecting with other custom systems that provide an API or a web service.\n\nThe deeper visual explanation of the solution:\n\nTo start using an On-prem agent in your scenarios, you need to:\n\nCreate a new On-prem agent in the On-prem agents section of the Organization dashboard.\n\nDownload the On-prem agent and install it on your device.\n\nConnect a system (an application) to the installed On-prem agent.\n\nAdd a connection between Make and the connected system when adding the application module in your scenario.\n\nAdding an On-prem agent\n\nThe installation process consists of three steps:\n\nCreating an On-prem agent in the On-prem agents section, in Make.\n\nDownloading the On-prem agent to your device.\n\nInstalling the On-prem agent on your device.\n\nImportant\n\nOnly users with the Owner, Admin, and App dev organization roles can perform all three steps.\n\nCreating an On-prem agent\n\nFirst, you need to create a new On-prem agent in Make.\n\nGo to the Organization section, the On-prem agents tab, and click Create a new on-prem agent. A window appears.\n\nIn the On-prem agent name field, enter the agent name.\n\nClick Create agent. A page with credentials appears.\n\nSave the Client ID, the Secret, and the Base URL because you will need these credentials in the installation stage later. Check I saved my credentials.\n\nWarning\n\nMake sure to save the credentials in this step in a secure location. This is the only time when Make shows the On-prem agent credentials.\n\nClick Download installer.\n\nMake redirects you to the download page, where you can choose your device OS and download the On-prem agent installer. In the Organization section, on the On-prem Agent tab, you can see the created On-prem agent with the Registered status.\n\nDownloading the On-prem agent\n\nYou need to download the installation package for the On-prem agent to run on your device.\n\nAfter creating the On-prem agent, Make redirects you to the download page.\n\nSelect the OS of your device, and click Download.\n\nTip\n\nFor macOS download the file for Linux: it is a .ZIP archive you will have to unzip when installing.\n\nTip\n\nIf the auto-download doesn't start automatically, follow the link that appears after you click Download.\n\nDefine where you want to save the On-prem agent installation package on your device.\n\nClick Save.\n\nYou downloaded the On-prem agent installation package to your device. You're ready to install the On-prem agent.\n\nInstalling the On-prem agent\n\nInstallation is the last step you need to start using the On-prem agent in Make. Here you will find steps for installing the On-prem agent on Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nInstallation for Windows\nInstallation for macOS\nInstallation for Linux\nConnecting a system\n\nOnce you installed the On-prem agent, you can connect it to an application (a connected system). You can connect several systems to one On-prem agent.\n\nImportant\n\nOnly users with the Owner, Admin, and App dev organization roles can connect a system.\n\nNote\n\nIn the BETA version, Make supports only HTTP Agent for the On-prem agent. There will be more apps in the future.\n\nConnect the HTTP system\n\nGo to the On-prem agents section and click the active agent that you want to use for a particular system (application).\n\nClick Connect system.\n\nIn the Name field, insert a connection name. This name appears when adding an application module to a scenario.\n\nIn the Choose app to connect dropdown list, select the HTTP Agent app.\n\nDefine the base URL to the application API.\n\nTip\n\nThe URL contains a host, a port, and a definition of API for a particular app. If the app runs on the same device where the On-prem agent is installed, the host is localhost. If the app runs on another device, the host is the device IP address. The port and the API definition vary based on the app.\n\nIn this example URL: https://localhost:3000/api:\n\nthe host is localhost\n\nthe port is 3000\n\nthe definition of API is /api\n\nIn the URL field, insert the URL to the application API.\n\nClick Save.\n\nIn the connected systems list, you see a new connection that works with this specific On-prem agent. Now you can start building a scenario.\n\nNote\n\nYou might be asked to renew the access to the connected system after a certain period of time. If so, click Revoke in the Connected systems section.\n\nCreating a connection in the scenario\n\nTo create a connection , go to the scenario editor.\n\nNote\n\nCurrently, Make supports only HTTP Agent application for the On-prem agent usage.\n\nClick Create a new scenario.\n\nSelect the HTTP Agent from the dropdown list.\n\nSelect a module and connect it to Make.\n\nFinish configuring the module settings.\n\nAfter adding the module, you can continue building your scenario. The module uses your selected On-prem agent.\n\nOn-prem agent status\n\nThe following table explains the possible On-prem agent status.\n\nStatus\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\t\n\nRecommended next steps\n\n\n\n\nActive\n\n\t\n\nThe On-prem agent is installed on your device and works under normal conditions.

The restrictions are in effect as of June 1st, 2020. The purpose of the new measures is to protect Google users from leakage or misuse of their personal data on Google. New restrictions are related to the Gmail and Google Drive apps. More info here.\n\nTo access restricted scopes, the connected service (Make or any other service that wants to access the user's data via the API) has to be verified and has to have a Letter of Assessment to prove that the service is secure and transparent about how they use the data. Make complies with all of Google’s requirements for access to restricted scopes, unfortunately, most of the third-party connected services in Make don't have the Letter of Assessment and therefore don't comply with Google terms. Because of that, we are not permitted to send data to these services.\n\nThere are a few exceptions where it is possible to send data to an unapproved third-party service that doesn’t have the Letter of Assessment and doesn’t violate any of these new restrictions.\n\nWe opted for the Domain-wide Installation exception. Domain-wide Installation is suited for Google Workspace users and this approach allows users to integrate unapproved services without any limitations. Simply speaking, if you are a Google Workspace user you don't have to perform any additional steps and can directly connect to unapproved services.\n\nFAQ\nWhat apps in Make are affected?\n\nGoogle Drive, Gmail, and Email (connected to Gmail account).\n\nDo I have a Google Workspace account?\n\nIf your email address ends with @gmail.com or @googlemail.com your account is not a Google Workspace account. If your Google account ends with custom domain e.g. @my-company.com then it is a Google Workspace account.\n\nGoogle Workspace users (click on your profile icon in the top-right corner of your Google account to display the following pane):\n\nThe This account is managed by <yourCompany> information is displayed in the top of the pane.\n\nGmail (non-business) users (click on your profile icon in the top-right corner of your Google account to display the following pane):\n\nYour email address ends with the @gmail.com or googlemail.com and there is no information as in the business Google account (above).\n\nWhat should I do if I'm @gmail.com or @googlemail.com user?\n\nIf you want to integrate any other service than Google Drive or Gmail, you don’t have to do anything special to connect to your services that use your @gmail.com or @googlemail.com account to sign in. Just create a connection to the service in the regular way as described in the Connecting an application article.\n\nThe changes only apply if you are integrating Google Drive or Gmail. If you want to connect to Google Drive or Gmail then you have to switch to Google Workspace or Connecting to Google services using custom OAuth client (advanced option).\n\nWhat should I do if I'm a Google Workspace user?\n\nThere is no required action.\n\nIn this section\nFAQ\nConnecting to Google Services With New Security Measures\nFAQ\nWhat apps in Make are affected?\nDo I have a Google Workspace account?\nWhat should I do if I'm @gmail.com or @googlemail.com user?\nWhat should I do if I'm a Google Workspace user?\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Our goal is to get a list of the latest deviations. Before configuring this scenario, you have to find out some basic information about the service.\n\nFirstly, go through the Development section and find out what method DeviantArt uses for user authentication, and which API is appropriate to perform the desired function.\n\nMake supports the following authorization types:\n\nOAuth2\n\nBasic Authorization\n\nAPI key\n\nGetting ready\n\nDeviantArt uses a standardized OAuth2 protocol for authorization. You can see that in the Authentication section.\n\nCreate a so-called client to be able to communicate with the API. Click Register your application link to create a client.\n\nA form opens up that allows you to create a new application. Fill in the name and description of the application and upload the icon.\n\nIn Application settings section, fill out the OAuth2 Redirect URI Whitelist field. All services that use standard OAuth2 protocol for authorization require this parameter.\n\nThe value of this parameter is always the same ‑ https://www.integromat.com/oauth/cb/oauth2. This is the URL, that a user is redirected to after they authorize Make to access the given service. This way, Make learns that the authorization has been successful, and creates a new connection with the service.\n\nOAuth redirect URI domain\n\nNotice that the redirect URI starts with https://www.integromat.com instead of https://www.make.com. This is currently a known issue in Make.\n\nMake was formerly called Integromat, which means you can trust this URL as much as any Make URL.\n\nPlease make sure all your OAuth redirect URIs point to https://www.integromat.com/oauth/cb/oauth2.\n\nOnce you have completed the registration, a screen opens where you can view two important values - client_id and client_secret. Write down these two values, you need them later on.\n\nGo back to the Authentication section and get authorization URL and access token URL. All services that use standard authorization OAuth2 protocol always include both URL addresses in their documentation.\n\nGo to the API section which describes all API calls in detail. The API you need is in GET /browse/newest.\n\nExpand the Authentication and Parameters sections to learn which scope is required to call this API and which parameters you can send along with the request.\n\nCreating a scenario\nNote\n\nBefore you start setting up your scenario in Make, we recommend that you go through all APIs that you plan to call and get a list of all scopes that are needed. This way you can acquire all the necessary scopes at once and avoid the hassle of expanding the scopes in the future.\n\nGo to Make and create a new scenario.\n\nChoose the OAuth 2.0 HTTP(S) request and response processing module from the HTTP app and add it to your scenario.\n\nIn the open configuration window, click Add. A new window opens that allows you to add a new OAuth2 connection. In this step, enter the information that you have found in the documentation:\n\nConnection name - Enter any name you would like to identify as the connection.\n\nAuthorize URI - The Authorize URL specified in the Authentication section of the DeviantArt documentation.\n\nToken URI - The Access Token URL indicated in the Authentication section of the DeviantArt documentation.\n\nScope - Specify the list of access scope that you want to grant to Make and associate with this connection. In our case, it is enough to select the browse value.\n\nClient ID - The client ID you got when creating the application.\n\nClient secret - The secret key you were given once you had created the application.\n\nClick Create a connection.\n\nA new window pops up. Click Authorize App to authorize Make to access the given service via the application you have created.\n\nThe access tokens exchange in the background automatically. The configuration window automatically populates with the newly created connection.\n\nSet up the URL address of the API endpoint according to the specifications given in the API documentation and specify optional parameters (in our case, we will enter https://www.deviantart.com/api/v1/oauth2/browse/newest).\n\nWhen creating a scenario, we recommend working with a smaller number of bundles.\n\nTesting\n\nRun your scenario.\n\nIf the execution results show that the call ended with a 200 status, the run completed successfully. The response details contain complete JSON data that is available for further use.\n\nCopy the whole JSON response to the system clipboard - you’ll need it in order to generate a data structure.\n\nThanks to the data structures, Make knows exactly what structure the received data has.\n\nUse JSON app > Parse JSON module to parse your data in order to use the data in your scenario.\n\nIn the settings of Parse JSON module, map the Data  variable from the HTTP app to the JSON string field.\n\nNext to the Data structure field, click Add. A panel opens. Select Generator.\n\nIn the data structure generator, choose the JSON value as Content type. In the Sample data field paste the JSON response from the server that you have copied to the system clipboard.\n\nOnce you confirm your entries, the data structure generates automatically.\n\nGive a name to the Data structure and click Save. \n\nClick Save to confirm the settings.\n\nRun the scenario.\n\nOnce the scenario run completes, view details of the JSON module run. If everything has been processed without errors, you will see a list of 5 new DeviantArt deviations. You can then easily browse through the data structure and map obtained values to other modules.\n\nIn this section\nGetting ready\nCreating a scenario\nTesting\nHow to connect Make to any web service that uses OAuth2 authorization\nGetting ready\nCreating a scenario\nTesting\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

You can connect the desired service (app) to Make using Make's HTTP module.\n\nIn the following article, we will describe how to connect almost any web service to Make using an API Key/API token.\n\nLike it is for most web services, the procedure of connecting the service via an API token is similar and consists of the following steps:\n\nCreate an application on the web service's website.\n\nObtain the API Key/API token.\n\nAdd Make's HTTP > Make an API Key Auth request module to your scenario.\n\nSet up the module according to the web service's API documentation and run the scenario.\n\nNote\n\nWe will use the Pushover notification service as an example.\n\nCreating a new application and obtaining the API token\n\nLog in to your Pushover account.\n\nClick Create an Application/API Token.\n\nFill in the application information and click Create an Application.\n\nStore the provided API token in a safe place. You will need it for your HTTP > Make an API Auth Key Request module to connect to the desired web service (Pushover, in this case).\n\nSetting up the HTTP module\n\nTo connect a web service to your Make scenario, you need to:\n\nAdd the HTTP > Make an API Key Auth request module to your Make scenario.\n\nSet up the HTTP > Make an API Key Auth request module according to the web service's API documentation.\n\nAdd the HTTP > Make an API Key Auth request module to your scenario.\n\nUnder Credentials, click Add.\n\nEnter your Pushover API Key into the Key field. Make hides your key. You can click on the visibility icon to view your key.\n\nEnter the following to integrate your Pushover account with Make:\n\nNote\n\nThese module settings correspond to the Pushover web service API documentation. Settings vary across web services. For example, some services require the API token in the Header and not in the Body field.\n\nURL : https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json\n\nThe URL field contains the endpoint that you can find in the respective web service's API documentation.\n\nMethod: POST\n\nSelect a method based on the endpoint you want to use. The Pushover endpoint for pushing messages requires the POST method.\n\nHeaders: Some web services may use Headers to specify the API token authentication and/or other parameters. This is not the case in our example as the Pushover's endpoint for pushing messages uses Body (see below) for all request types.\n\nQuery String: Some web services may use Query String to specify other parameters. This is not the case in our example as the Pushover web service uses Body (see below) for all request types.\n\nBody Type: Raw - This setting allows you to select the JSON content type in the Content Type field below.\n\nContent Type: JSON (application/json)\n\nJSON is the required content type by the Pushover app. This may differ from other web services.\n\nRequest Content: Enter the Body request content in the JSON format. You can use the JSON > Create JSON module or enter the JSON content manually.\n\nNote\n\nSee the web service's API documentation for the required parameters (fields).\n\nManually enter the JSON request body\n\nSpecify the following parameters in JSON format:\n\nuser\n\n\t\n\nThe user key from your Pushover dashboard.\n\n\n\n\ntoken\n\n\t\n\nThe API token that you generated in step 4.\n\n\n\n\nmessage\n\n\t\n\nThe text content of the push notification sent to your devices.\n\n\n\n\ntitle\n\n\t\n\nOptional The message's title. If left blank, your app's name is the title by default.\n\nExample:\n\n{\"user\":\"12345c2ecu1hq42ypqzhswbyam34\",\n\"token\":\"123459evz8aepwtxydndydgyumbfx\",\n\"message\":\"Hello World!\",\n\"title\":\"The Push Notification\"}\nJSON body mapped using the JSON > Create JSON module\n\nThe Create JSON module helps you create the JSON required for your request body. It also gives you the possibility to define values dynamically. For more information about the JSON modules please refer to the JSON documentation.\n\nEnter (or map) the values you want to create JSON from.\n\nConnect the JSON > Create JSON module to the HTTP > Make an API Key Auth Request module you have already set up (above).\n\nMap the JSON string from the Create JSON module to the Request content field in the HTTP > Make an API Key Auth Request module.\n\nNow when you run the scenario, the push notification is sent to the device registered in your Pushover account.\n\nIn this section\nCreating a new application and obtaining the API token\nSetting up the HTTP module\nConnecting Make to any web service that uses API tokens authorization\nCreating a new application and obtaining the API token\nSetting up the HTTP module\nManually enter the JSON request body\nJSON body mapped using the JSON > Create JSON module\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Dropbox prompts you to grant Make access to your data.\n\nGrant Make access to your Dropbox account.\n\nClick Save.\n\nYou have set the build-time value for the dynamic connection. You can see the connection in the Build-time value field.\n\nSelect whether you want to use the build-time connection as the default or not. Make uses the default value to run the scenario. You can select a different connection when you run the scenario on-demand.\n\n(Optional): You can select the dynamic connection default value in the Default value selection box or create a new connection with the Add button.\n\nNote\n\nIf you don't provide a default for the dynamic connection, you can schedule the scenario to On-demand only.\n\nClick Save.\n\nYou created a dynamic connection. Now you can continue configuring the module.\n\nTip\n\nYou can set the default for the dynamic connection in the scenario inputs interface as well:\n\nYou can find the list of dynamic connections:\n\nIn the module:\n\nIn the Scenario inputs window:\n\nIn the Build-time value tab, the dynamic connection with the connection its using:\n\nRunning a scenario with a dynamic connection\n\nA dynamic connection is like a variable or a container for connections, which is empty until you assign a connection to it. To run a scenario with a dynamic connection, you have to assign a connection to it or use a default. You can either create a new dynamic connection or use an existing one.\n\nUsing an existing dynamic connection\n\nTo run a scenario with a dynamic connection, use the scenario inputs. In scenario inputs, assign a connection to the dynamic connection for your scenario run or use the default.\n\nNote\n\nTo run your scenario on schedule, you have to provide a default for your dynamic connections. Make uses the default connection in scheduled scenario runs.\n\nGo to your scenario.\n\nClick Run once. A scenario inputs window appears.\n\nYou can either set up a new connection or use an existing connection.\n\nTo set up a new connection, click Add. The app prompts you to grant Make access to your account.\n\nTo use a connection that already exists, select the connection from the dropdown list.\n\nNote\n\nThe dropdown list shows only connections available for the app.\n\nClick OK.\n\nMake runs the scenario with the selected connections.\n\nUpdating a dynamic connection\n\nCompared to other connections, dynamic connections are flexible and can change the value they contain. For example, you might want to assign a different connection to the dynamic connection with each scenario run. This might be practical when you want to frequently use different credentials in the scenario.\n\nAnother option is to update just the default for the dynamic connection for scheduled scenario runs.\n\nYou can update a dynamic connection:\n\nin the app module\n\nin scenario inputs\n\nUpdating dynamic connections in the app module\n\nOpen the Connections dropdown list in the app module and find the dynamic connection you want to edit.\n\nClick Edit.\n\nOptional: You can change the dynamic connection name as well.\n\nIn the Build-time value dropdown list, select the connection you want to assign to the dynamic connection. Click Add, if you want to create a new connection.\n\nClick Save.\n\nYou have updated the dynamic connection. When the scenario runs, the dynamic connection will use the connection you assigned.\n\nUpdating dynamic connections in the scenario inputs\n\nGo to the scenario in which you want to update the dynamic connection.\n\nClick scenario inputs.\n\nGo to the Build-time value tab.\n\nClick Edit.\n\nIn the dropdown list, select another connection you want to assign to the dynamic connection. Click Add if you want to create a new connection.\n\nClick Save.\n\nYou have updated the dynamic connection.

For example, a connection lets Make check your Gmail and enter the sender and subject into Google Sheets.\n\nBecause third parties have different technologies and standards, there are different ways to create connections in Make. For some apps, creating a connection requires logging in to the third-party app and clicking that you agree to let Make access your profile and data. Other third parties require an API key or OAuth credentials.\n\nMake offers two types of connections:\n\nStandard - the most common kind of connection and the type explained in this article.\n\nDynamic - a feature for Enterprise customers that lets you easily switch between multiple connections. This way you can have a separate connection for each team or department in your company and change them as needed.\n\nCreating a connection\n\nYou create connections in the scenario editor when you add a module. All users in your team can use any connections you create in that team. Use your personal third-party account and credentials carefully, especially when your team has other users.\n\nImportant\n\nAll team members can manage connections as well. If you want to connect Make with your personal account or data, consider creating a separate team where you are the only member.\n\nThe following is the general way to create a connection. For more details, see the article on the specific app you want to connect.\n\nGo to your scenario and add a module. For example, click + and search for Dropbox. Then select the module you want, such as Create a Folder.\n\nClick Create a connection.\n\nIn the Connection name field, you can name your connection. For example, if you have two different Dropbox accounts, you might name one Dropbox-Company, and the second Dropbox-Personal.\n\nTip\n\nIf your app has fields for:\n\nCredentials such as username and password\n\nAPI Key\n\nClient ID and client secret\n\nAnything not on this list\n\nRefer to the article on the specific app you want to connect for more information.\n\nClick Save. A new window prompts you to grant Make access to your data.\n\nTip\n\nSteps 4 and 5 can vary. Carefully follow on-screen instructions when granting consent.\n\nGrant Make access to your Dropbox account and data.\n\nYou created a connection between your Dropbox account and Make and you can continue setting up the module. You can find the connection in the Connections section:\n\nManaging connections\n\nThe connections tab lets you do any of the following to your connections:\n\nEdit\n\nVerify\n\nReauthorize\n\nDelete\n\nYou can find the connections by clicking  in the left sidebar.\n\nEdit connections\n\nYou can edit the setup of some connections. Clicking Edit for a connection opens a pop-up where you can adjust the information you previously entered.\n\nVerify connections\n\nYou can see whether your connection works by clicking Verify. The button briefly changes to Verifying ... as Make checks. A green check mark in a circle appears when successful.\n\nReauthorize connections\n\nSome third parties, such as Google only grant access for a limited time. In this case, you may need to occasionally reauthorize your connection. Just click Reauthorize and follow any on-screen prompts that appear.\n\nDelete connections\n\nIf you need to delete a connection, click Delete. The button turns red and asks again to confirm that you want to erase that connection. Click again to delete your connection.\n\nCaution\n\nDeleting a connection may cause your scenarios to stop working. Be sure that the connection is not used in any scheduled or active scenarios.\n\nIn this section\nCreating a connection\nManaging connections\nConnecting an application\nCreating a connection\nManaging connections\nEdit connections\nVerify connections\nReauthorize connections\nDelete connections\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Email notifications let you know when it's time to rotate your certificates.\n\nRotate service provider certificates\n\nTo maintain the security of your SSO setup, Make supports service provider (SP) certificate rotation on a 3-year basis. When your SP certificate is 90 days from expiring, Make provides a new certificate and sends you an email. Rotate your certificate before it expires to avoid login failure. You can see when your certificate expires by looking under the Expires column of the Service Provider Certificates section of your SSO setup.\n\nYou can activate your new certificate and copy or download it with the following steps:\n\nLog in to your Make account.\n\nGo to the SSO section of your organization dashboard.\n\nUnder SSO configuration, find your Service Provider Certificates.\n\nFind your new certificate.

You cannot change to which team a particular item belongs.\n\nA user can be a member of any number of teams within the same organization.\n\nYou must always have at least one team in an organization.\n\nTeams are available only in the Teams plan\n\nIf you're on a plan lower than the Teams plan, you can always have only one team in your organization.\n\nTeams and organizations\n\nOrganizations are the most basic organizational unit, or container, to which all elements within Make are assigned. An organization can contain any number of teams.\n\nYou register users into an organization. Then, you assign users to teams. A user can be a member of any number of organizations and any number of teams. A user can have a different role in each team.\n\nCreating teams\n\nYou can create teams in the Organization > Teams section.\n\nYou create teams inside organizations. You must be an owner or an admin of an organization to manage its teams.\n\nGo to Organization > Teams.\n\nClick Add a new team.\n\nEnter the new team's name and click Add.\n\nThe new team appears in the list of teams. Click the team name or the Edit button to manage team members.\n\nManaging teams\n\nTeams allow you to view the team's consumption of operations and data transfer, manage team members and their roles, and set up notifications.\n\nMonitoring operations and Scenario executions\n\nMake allows you to monitor operations and data transfer consumed by each team. Click Team in the menu to view these statistics.\n\nSince scenarios always belong to teams, their execution history is also tracked for each team separately.\n\nManaging team members\n\nWhen adding users to teams, you assign team roles to the users. Roles determine what permissions users have and what users can do with the team's data.\n\nTo manage team members, go to Team > Users. The Users section shows all users in your organization and the role they have in the selected team. Users who don't belong to the selected team have their team role set to None.\n\nTo add a user to the team, click the Role menu and select a role other than None.\n\nYou can assign users to the following roles:\n\nTeam Admin has full access to all data within the team. Only team admins can create custom functions.\n\nTeam Member has full access to all data within the team, but cannot manage team members and cannot delete the team.\n\nTeam Monitoring has read-only access to the team, scenarios, and templates.\n\nTeam Operator has read-only access to all data within the team. In addition, the Team Operator can activate or stop scenarios and set up scenario schedules.\n\nTeam Restricted Member has full access to all data within the team, but cannot modify the team.\n\nSee the table below for details on team role permissions.\n\nTo remove a user from a team, select None from the Role menu. Make removes the user from its team role, which effectively removes the user from the team.\n\nNote\n\nOwners and admins of a team's parent organization always have Team Admin permissions.\n\nManaging team notification options\n\nUsing Notification options, you can control how Make notifies team members about warnings and errors in scenarios.\n\nIn this section\nTeams and organizations\nCreating teams\nManaging teams\nTeams\nTeams and organizations\nCreating teams\nManaging teams\nMonitoring operations and Scenario executions\nManaging team members\nManaging team notification options\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Each organization has a separate pricing plan and is billed separately. This means that you can also monitor your operations and data consumption for each organization separately.\n\nEach organization allows you to select the geographical location of the data center, where the organization's data will be stored and processed. Currently, Make supports two data center locations:\n\nUnited States (US)\n\nEuropean Union (EU)\n\nNote\n\nThe geographical location that you select for an organization does not represent where your company or your users are located, but where the data center that stores and processes your data is located.\n\nMake recommends that you select the location closest to you to ensure low latency.\n\nWarning\n\nYou cannot change the location of the data center after you create the organization.\n\nCreating organizations\n\nAny user can create their own organization, even if they already are a member of another organization.\n\nClick your user name in the left menu, and then click Profile.\n\nIn the Organizations tab, click Create a new organization.\n\nFill in the details of the new organization. Note that Region represents the location of the data center that will store and process your data. Country represents your physical location but is currently not used by Make in any way.\n\nMake creates your new organization. By default, the pricing plan for the organization is set to Free. The organization contains one team, called My team.\n\nAdding users to organizations\n\nTo add users to an organization, you must be the owner or an admin of the organization. For more details about roles, refer to Organization roles.\n\nGo to the Organization tab and select your organization.\n\nClick on Users.\n\nClick Invite a new user.\n\nIn the dialog that opens, fill in the details of the user:\n\nEmail - the invited user's email address .\n\nName - the name of the user. The user can change their name after they accept the invitation.\n\nRole in the organization\n\nTeam\n\nNote\n\nYou must select at least one team for the user to be able to work with Make.\n\nNote - your custom message that appears in the invitation email.\n\nClick Save.\n\nThe user receives an invitation email where they can accept the invitation by clicking Accept invitation button.\n\nWhen the user accepts the invitation, the system adds them to the organization. The system also adds the user to the selected team with the team member role. More about teams.\n\nNote\n\nThe invitation expires in 7 days. If the invited user does not accept the invitation, use the following steps:\n\nRemove the invited user from your organization. See the section below.\n\nUse the above procedure to send a new invitation.\n\nRemoving users\n\nTo remove users from an organization, you must be the owner or an admin of the organization.\n\nGo to the Organization tab and select your organization.\n\nClick on Users.\n\nUse the dropdown menu in the Role column to select Remove.\n\nThe user disappears from the list and a message briefly appears confirming the change.\n\nOrganization roles\n\nMake provides a two-level permission model. All users are members of at least one organization and one team. The permissions that users have are determined by the organization role and team role that they are assigned to.\n\nThe following table describes actions that members of different organization roles can perform.\n\nFor information about team roles, read the article about teams.\n\nSwitching organizations\n\nIf you are a member of multiple organizations, you can change the active organization in the left menu. All items in the menu represent items that belong to the currently selected organization.\n\nTransfer ownership\n\nWhen you create an organization, you automatically become the owner of the organization. Organization owners can manage and access all teams in an organization. An organization can have only one owner. If you are the owner of an organization, you can transfer ownership to any member of your organization.\n\nGo to your Organization dashboard by clicking Organization in the left sidebar.\n\nNext to Organization settings, click the drop-down arrow to expand the drop-down menu.\n\nSelect Transfer ownership.\n\nUse the drop menu to select the organization member you want to be the owner of the organization. All organization members appear in the menu. You may need to add someone to your organization. Once a new member accepts the invitation, you can transfer ownership to them.\n\nClick Save.\n\nA purple pop-up appears confirming that ownership is transferred successfully.\n\nIn this section\nCreating organizations\nAdding users to organizations\nOrganization roles\nSwitching organizations\nTransfer ownership\nOrganizations\nCreating organizations\nAdding users to organizations\nRemoving users\nOrganization roles\nSwitching organizations\nTransfer ownership\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Extra operations auto-purchasing covers you when you reach your limit of operations by automatically purchasing extra operations.\n\nWhen you use all of the operations in your subscription, Make automatically purchases 10,000 extra operations. All automatic purchases are in units of 10,000 operations. Make then charges you for the 10,000 extra operations.\n\nIf you use all 10,000 extra operations, Make auto-purchases 10,000 operations again. Make limits auto-purchasing to the number of operations in your subscription. For example. if your plan has 80,000 operations, Make auto-purchases a maximum of 8 times.\n\nExample\n\nIn this example, you have a monthly subscription plan with 80,000 operations. You enable extra operations auto-purchasing. When you use all 80,000 of your monthly operations, the following happens:\n\nMake automatically purchases 10,000 operations and keeps your scenarios running.\n\nCaution\n\nIf your payment fails, your scenarios pause until you update your payment method. Make sends you an email notification when your payment fails.\n\nMake charges you for the 10,000 operations based on your plan and adds a 30% surcharge.\n\nLet's assume that your scenarios use all 10,000 extra operations before the monthly billing cycle renews. Extra operations auto-purchasing buys an additional 10,000 operations.\n\nSo far, extra operations auto-purchasing has purchased a total of 20,000. Your auto-purchase limit per monthly cycle is 80,000 operations. In this example, extra operations auto-purchasing is only possible six more times, i.e. 60,000 extra operations.\n\nEnable extra operations auto-purchasing\n\nGo to your organization dashboard.\n\nClick the toggle for extra operations auto-purchasing.\n\nIn the pop-up, select a payment method.\n\nCaution\n\nExtra operations auto-purchasing only accepts card payments.\n\nIf you do not have a saved payment card, the pop-up instructs you to enter a new payment. Click Enter a payment method and follow the on-screen instructions.\n\nAfter you enter and save a payment method, a redirect takes you back to your organization dashboard. Repeat steps 2 and 3 above.\n\nClick Turn on.\n\nThe pop-up disappears and the toggle now displays its status as On.\n\nDisable extra operations auto-purchasing\n\nGo to your organization dashboard.\n\nClick the toggle for extra operations auto-purchasing.\n\nIn the pop-up, click Turn off.\n\nThe pop-up disappears and the toggle now displays its status as Off.\n\nIn this section\nExample\nEnable extra operations auto-purchasing\nDisable extra operations auto-purchasing\nEnable extra operations auto-purchasing\nExample\nEnable extra operations auto-purchasing\nDisable extra operations auto-purchasing\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

However, Make uses organization time zones and user time zones differently:\n\nThe organization time zone defines the time used when executing scenarios and modules. For example, a scenario schedule of \"4:00 pm every day\" means 4:00 pm in the organization's time zone.\n\nThe user time zone is similar to locale and defines how Make displays time, for example, in scenario execution history.\n\nAs a result, organization members in a time zone different from the organization's time zone may see different times displayed. See the example below for more details.\n\nYour profile page lets you view and edit time zone settings from the Time Zone Options tab.\n\nExample\n\nA Make organization based in New York City has members in New York City, Los Angeles, and London. When members view scenario execution histories, they see that information relative to their local time zone. Members in London see the time scenarios executed in London time, Los Angeles members see those execution times in LA time, and so on. However, when they schedule scenarios, Make uses New York City time regardless of the user's location.\n\nUser name\n\n\t\n\nUser city and time zone\n\n\t\n\nOrganization time zone\n\n\t\n\nTime zone that the user sees in scenario editor and logs\n\n\t\n\nTime zone used for scenario execution\n\n\n\n\nAmal\n\n\t\n\nNew York\n\n(GMT-05:00) America/New_York\n\n\t\n\n(GMT-05:00) America/New_York\n\n\t\n\n(GMT-05:00) America/New_York\n\n\t\n\n(GMT-05:00) America/New_York\n\n\n\n\nBola\n\n\t\n\nLos Angeles\n\n(GMT-08:00) America/Los_Angeles\n\n\t\n\n(GMT-05:00) America/New_York\n\n\t\n\n(GMT-08:00) America/Los_Angeles\n\n\t\n\n(GMT-05:00) America/New_York\n\n\n\n\nCharlie\n\n\t\n\nLondon\n\n(GMT+0:00) Europe/London\n\n\t\n\n(GMT-05:00) America/New_York\n\n\t\n\n(GMT+0:00) Europe/London\n\n\t\n\n(GMT-05:00) America/New_York\n\nManage organization time zone\n\nMake uses an organization's time zone to define when a scheduled scenario executes. The organization time zone defines scenario execution and functions such as formatDate and parseDate. Unless otherwise specified, Make uses the organization time zone as the default time for time and date-related functions and scenario execution. You can view and edit your organization time zones on the Time Zone Options tab of the profile page.\n\nNote\n\nOnly organization owners and admins can edit the organization's time zone.\n\nGo to your profile page and click Time Zone Options.\n\nMake lists your organizations under Scenarios and displays the current time zone setting.\n\nClick  to edit an organization's setting.\n\nA dialog appears where you can use the menu to search and select a new time zone.\n\nClick Save.\n\nThe selected time zone now appears on the Time Zone Options page.\n\nAny scehduled scenarios execute at the scheduled time in the time zone you assigned in step 4.\n\nManage user time zone\n\nMake uses your user time zone to display time and date information. For example, execution logs display the time in your user time zone. The user time zone only impacts how Make displays information, such as the date and time displayed in module output, bundles, or a log. Changing the user time zone does not impact scenario execution. You can view and edit your user time zone anytime on the Time Zone Options tab of the profile page:\n\nGo to your profile page and click Time Zone Options.\n\nFind your name in the Web section. Make displays the current time zone setting.\n\nClick  to edit your settings.\n\nA dialog appears where you can use the menu to search and select a new time zone.\n\nClick Save.\n\nThe selected time zone now appears on the Time Zone Options page.\n\nIn this section\nExample\nManage organization time zone\nManage user time zone\nManage time zones\nExample\nManage organization time zone\nManage user time zone\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

This will give you access to a more stable and reliable infrastructure. Make provides an effective tool to let you migrate your data fast and easy.\n\nIn this article, you will learn how to use the Make Migration tool to move your data and start enjoying the Enterprise plan.\n\nMigration scope overview\n\nThe Migration tool has two modes:\n\nFast mode enables automatic migration of selected scenarios and their associated data. In some cases, the system may require you to take manual steps.\n\nManual mode allows you to choose which data to migrate and how to handle it in your Enterprise instance.\n\nWhich data can you migrate?\n\nThe Migration tool migrates the following items:\n\nScenarios and scenario folders;\n\nConnections (except those that are associated with connected systems and On-prem Agents);\n\nWebhooks and mailhooks;\n\nKeys;\n\nData stores;\n\nData structures;\n\nCustom apps.\n\nNote\n\nIf the following items exist in your source instance, but no scenarios use them, the Migration tool doesn't move them to the target instance:\n\nConnections;\n\nWebhooks and mailhooks;\n\nKeys;\n\nData stores;\n\nData structures.\n\nWhich data can't you migrate?\n\nUser accounts;\n\nOrganizations;\n\nScenario executions history and logs;\n\nIncomplete executions;\n\nConnections associated with connected systems and On-prem Agents;\n\nWebhook and mailhook queues and logs;\n\nDevices;\n\nPayment details and extra operations.\n\nPrepare your data\n\nThe Migration tool has some peculiarities that you need to keep in mind when migrating your data either in a fast or a manual mode. To arrange your target instance better, consider taking some measures that allow you to overcome limits of the Migration tool.\n\nTeams\n\nKeep in mind that: Migration involves transferring data from one team in the source instance to another team in the target instance.\n\nDo it: To have your data in different teams in the target instance:\n\nIn the target instance, create as many teams as needed.\n\nIn the Migration tool, select the team you want to migrate scenarios to, and then select the specific scenarios to be moved to the selected team.\n\nTip\n\nYou can't move scenarios from one team to another after finishing migration. When migration is complete, you can clone scenarios and select the desired team for them.\n\nTo avoid data inconsistency, we recommend not migrating data from the same team more than once.\n\nTime zones\n\nKeep in mind that: The Migration tool doesn't migrate the time zone settings. You need to set up time zones in the target instance.\n\nDo it: If you aim to run scenarios in the target instance according to the time zone that you have in the source instance, manually set up a time zone in the target instance. Learn more about managing time zones.\n\nScenarios\n\nKeep in mind that: If your scenarios contain apps that require you to whitelist IP addresses for access, you need them to have relevant IPs associated with the target instance.\n\nDo it: Before migrating such scenarios, add the following IPs to apps depending on your zone: eu1.make.celonis.com or us1.make.celonis.com. You may delete those IPs from apps in the source instance after the migration is done.\n\nKeep in mind that: The Migration tool doesn't migrate a webhook or mailhook queue. It can cause problems if you use sequential processing because scenarios data may arrive to the target instance before the queue is processed in the source instance.\n\nDo it: To ensure sequential processing, do one of the options:\n\nOption 1: Process the entire queue in the source instance before migrating.\n\nOption 2:\n\nMigrate scenarios in the manual mode.\n\nDisable scenarios in the target instance and enable scenarios in the source instance.\n\nProcess the webhook queue.\n\nOnce all the data is processed, enable scenarios in the target instance.\n\nNote\n\nData received after migration goes to the new webhook URL and will be processed once you enable scenarios in the target instance.\n\nConnections\n\nKeep in mind that: The Migration tool doesn't replace one connection with another if they have different scopes and permissions.\n\nDo it: Ensure that scopes and permissions of connections in the target instance match scopes and permissions of connections that you want to replace.\n\nData stores\n\nKeep in mind that: Data may be inconsistent between the source and target instances if the Migration tool moves scenarios that update data stores more frequently than every five minutes.\n\nDo it: To avoid inconsistency:\n\nStop all scenarios in the source instance before starting migration.\n\nNote\n\nYou have to stop only scenarios that contain the Add/replace a record, Delete all records, Delete a record, and Update a record modules.\n\nMigrate scenarios.\n\nRun scenarios in the target instance.\n\nCustom apps\n\nKeep in mind that: You cannot migrate scenarios with published custom apps if you didn't install those apps into the target instance beforehand.\n\nDo it: To have scenarios with custom apps in the target instance:\n\nIf the custom app has the Private status, publish it. Refer to the App Builder documentation to learn more.\n\nNote\n\nIt is not possible to migrate apps that have the Private status. Publish the app after making all the necessary changes.\n\nWhen the custom app has the Published status, you cannot:\n\nMake the custom app Private again\n\nDelete the custom app\n\nDelete a module from the custom app\n\nInstall the published custom app in the target instance.\n\nMigrate scenarios.\n\nMigrate your data\n\nIt's time to proceed with the migration process. You can migrate as many scenarios as you want at once. If you didn't migrate all scenarios at once, you can continue later.\n\nFollow the next steps to start migration:\n\nGo to the Migration tool.\n\nRead all the information and click Let's start.\n\nIn the Source and Target sections, select Make.\n\nIn both sections, click Sign in to source and Sign in to target respectively, and log in to both Make instances. Then click Continue.\n\nIn both Organization dropdown lists, select the source organization to migrate data from, and the target organization to migrate the data into\n\nIn both Team dropdown lists, select the source team to migrate data from, and the target team to migrate data into. Then click Continue.\n\nYou see the list of all scenarios that your source instance has. You can select the migration mode: fast or manual.\n\nNote\n\nThe Migration tool doesn't migrate scenarios that have errors: you can find them in the Non-migratable scenarios tab. If you want to move those scenarios to the target instance, you must first resolve the errors.\n\nManage your data and finish migration\n\nDepending on the migration mode you chose, you need to decide how to handle your data from the source instance. Some options are available only for the manual mode.\n\nWe highly recommend using the fast migration mode to ensure smooth and easy data transferring.\n\nSelect custom apps to replace ones that migrated scenarios use.\n\nSelect the action for connections:\n\nDuplicate a connection in the target instance.\n\nReplace a connection with the one that exists in the target instance.\n\nNote\n\nThe set of scopes or permissions of a particular connection might differ between the source and the target instance. To see the scopes of a specific connection, go to the Connection section and click the eye  icon.\n\nIf you need to extend scopes:\n\nLog in to either a source or a target instance depending on where you need to extend scopes.\n\nCreate a new scenario or open an existing one.\n\nAdd a module that requires additional scopes.\n\nCreate a new connection. Make will ask you to provide additional permissions. Click Continue.\n\nOn the app page where you're redirected to, confirm granting new scopes.\n\nOptional: Delete the module or the newly created scenario if you don't need it.\n\nSome apps allow adding scopes manually when creating a new connection. If you created a custom application in a service itself, you may extend scopes in your service account.\n\nUse a previously migrated connection.\n\nSelect the action for webhooks and mailhooks:\n\nDuplicate a webhook or mailhook.\n\nDuplicate a webhook or mailhook and forward traffic.\n\nNote\n\nWe recommend always choosing the second option. If you just duplicate a webhook or mailhook, traffic will still be sent on the webhook or mailhook that you have in the source instance, and no data will appear in the target instance.\n\nA duplicated webhook will have a different URL.\n\nIf you have linked devices in your source instance, create a mock device in the target instance.\n\nNote\n\nYou need to replace a mock device with a real device. See more information in the section below.\n\nSelect the action for data stores:\n\nDuplicate a data store and migrate its content.\n\nDuplicate a data store without its content.\n\nReplace a data store with the one that exists in the target instance.\n\nNote\n\nThe Migration tool will replace data in the data store in the target instance with data from the source instance. If you use auto-generated keys, Make will store data under different keys in the target instance.\n\nSelect the action for data structures:\n\nDuplicate a data structure.\n\nReplace a data structure with the one that exists in the target instance.\n\nSelect the action for keys:\n\nDuplicate a key.\n\nNote\n\nA duplicated key contains the relevant data, but the key ID is different.\n\nReplace a key with the one that exists in the target instance.\n\nSelect the action for folders:\n\nDuplicate a folder.\n\nReplace a folder with the one that exists in the target instance.\n\nSelect what you want to do with scenarios both in the source and target instances.\n\nImportant\n\nIf at least one scenario contains webhooks or mailhooks, Make automatically disables all migrated scenarios. You may enable them manually after migration.\n\nClick Start migration\n\nThe migration is completed. The Migration tool shows the list of scenarios and entities it migrated and confirms that the migration process was successful. Click Show log to see the migration log.\n\nIf the migration fails, the Migration tool rolls back all changes made both to the source and target instances. Check the migration log out to find out reasons for the failure.\n\nPost-migration data setup\n\nUsing the Migration tool to move your data to a different server environment ensures smooth and easy migration. Still, you must consider specific details and take certain actions after migration to fully benefit from the Enterprise plan.\n\nYour data will remain in your source instance after migration.\n\nSubscriptions and coupons\n\nMake doesn't automatically cancel your source instance subscription. After you fully set up your target instance, you need to manually cancel your subscription. After that, your source instance moves to the Free pricing plan: you can use all available features within this plan.\n\nExtra operations remain in the source instance. Contact our Support to move extra operations to the target instance.\n\nScenarios\n\nAfter migrating scenarios scheduled as immediately, they execute once the scenarios trigger receives new data.\n\nSome scenarios require additional configuration after migration. Pay attention to scenarios that contain:\n\nCustom apps: They may require additional setup.\n\nApps that require IP whitelisting: Make sure that the migrated scenarios have updated IPs in their apps.\n\nThe Make app: Create a new connection and update all IDs mapped in the app modules. New IDs should be associated with the data based on the target instance.\n\nOn-prem connections\n\nThe Migration tool doesn't migrate connections associated with connected systems and On-prem Agents. You need to manually create connections in the target instance and then link them to connected systems.\n\nWebhooks and mailhooks\n\nIf during migration you selected duplicating webhooks or mailhooks and forwarding traffic, the old URL in the source instance still receives traffic, but redirects it to the new URL in the target instance. Don't delete the old URL in order not to lose traffic. Contact our Support to receive a list of pairs of old and new URLs.\n\nDevices\n\nThe Migration tool creates mock devices in the target instance to migrate scenarios that use the iOS or Android app.\n\nNote\n\nThe mock device is called a deaf device in the target instance.\n\nAfter migration, to use such scenarios, you must:\n\nCreate a new device manually in the target instance.\n\nReplace a mock device with the newly created in all relevant scenarios.\n\nDelete all mock devices.\n\nIn this section\nMigration scope overview\nPrepare your data\nMigrate your data\nPost-migration data setup\nUpgrading to the Enterprise plan\nMigration scope overview\nWhich data can you migrate?\nWhich data can't you migrate?\nPrepare your data\nTeams\nTime zones\nScenarios\nConnections\nData stores\nCustom apps\nMigrate your data\nManage your data and finish migration\nPost-migration data setup\nSubscriptions and coupons\nScenarios\nOn-prem connections\nWebhooks and mailhooks\nDevices\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Review the details and click Redeem Coupon.\n\nNote\n\nDepending on the details of your discount and your plan, you may be redirected to a payment gateway to finish redeeming your coupon.\n\nTo confirm the successful redemption of your coupon, check the details in the Organization panel, Subscription panel, or Subscription > My Plan.\n\nSubscription coupons\nSubscription coupons and your plan\n\nUsing a coupon for a subscription plan places you on that plan if you have a saved payment method.\n\nTo return to the plan you had before the coupon, change your subscription before your coupon expires.\n\nIf you do not have a valid payment method saved, you will have a Free plan when your coupon expires.\n\nSubscription coupons and your billing cycle\n\nAfter you redeem your subscription coupon, your billing cycle changes. The day you redeem your coupon becomes the new start date of your billing cycle.\n\nExample:\n\nYou have a Core plan that renews on the 20th of each month. You receive a coupon for the Teams plan. On the 15th you redeem your coupon. The 15th is now the beginning of your monthly billing cycle.\n\nExceptions:\n\nCoupons for the same plan do not impact your billing cycle. For example, a discount on your current plan.\n\nCore plans with an annual subscription have different billing and reset cycles. See the note on Core plans in our article on changing your subscription.\n\nTip\n\nYou can only have 1 subscription coupon applied to your subscription plan at a time. Redeeming a second plan coupon cancels the first. This limit does not apply to coupons for extra operations. You can combine coupons for plans and extra operations.\n\nExtra operations\n\nYou do not need a saved payment method to use coupons for extra operations.\n\nExtra operations are valid for the length of your billing cycle and expire on your billing day.\n\nExample:\n\nYou have a coupon for 10,000 extra operations and your monthly subscription is the 15th of the month. If you redeem the extra operations on the 14th, they are valid until the 15th.\n\nNote\n\nExtra operations are valid until the end of your billing cycle regardless of how many other coupons you redeem.\n\nIn this section\nHow to redeem coupons\nSubscription coupons\nExtra operations\nCoupons\nHow to redeem coupons\nSubscription coupons\nSubscription coupons and your plan\nSubscription coupons and your billing cycle\nExtra operations\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

These terms do not apply when downgrading to the Free plan.\n\nNo cash refund\n\nMake has no cash refund policy.\n\nIf you decide to upgrade we convert your unused operations to credit. If you decide to downgrade we transfer your unused operations to the new plan. Learn more in the upgrade and downgrade section.\n\nUpgrading your subscription\nTypes of upgrade\n\nYou can upgrade between plans and between tiers. Plans differ in features, and tiers refer to the number of operations.\n\nAn upgrade can be:\n\nChanging from a lower plan to a higher plan, regardless of the tier (e.g. changing from the highest tier in Core to the lowest tier in Teams)\n\nChanging within the same plan to a higher tier (e.g. from 10,000 operations per month in Pro to 150,000 operations per month in Pro)\n\nChanging from a monthly to an annual subscription to an equal or higher tier (e.g. changing from 10,000 per month in Pro to 120,000 per year in Pro)\n\nHow to upgrade\n\nGo to Organization > Subscription.\n\nA purple border and highlight mark your current plan.\n\nUse the toggle to select a monthly or annual subscription.\n\nClick the arrow to open a drop-down menu with different operation tiers. Choose the number of operations in your new plan.\n\nClick Buy plan on your chosen plan and tier. Annual subscriptions appear as Buy yearly plan.\n\nLeft: monthly subscription; Right: annual subscription\n\nCheck your billing info and use the edit button  to update if necessary.\n\nClick Select payment method.\n\nUse the drop down menu to select a payment method.\n\nFollow the on-screen instructions from Stripe checkout.\n\nReview your payment information and click Subscribe.\n\nA notification pops up saying that your plan was successfully changed. Your new plan is highlighted on the subscription page.\n\nCredit\n\nIf you decide to upgrade, we convert your unused operations (including purchased extra operations) to credit in dollars according to the price per operation in your current plan.\n\nWe deduct this credit immediately from your payment for the new upgraded subscription. The credit is visible in the checkout page calculation.\n\nCredit calculation explained\n\nFor example, you want to upgrade from Core to Pro, and you have 160,000 unused operations. We convert these unused operations to credit. You can find the calculation logic below.\n\nWe calculate the price per single operation in your original price plan.\n\nWe do this by dividing the price of the plan with the number of operations.\n\nIn this example the original price of the Core plan is $113.85 and it has 150,000 operations per month.\n\n$113.85 divided by 150,000 operations equals $0,000759 per one operation.\n\nWe multiply the price per operation with the number of unused operations.\n\nOur price per operation is $0.00075 and there are 160,000 unused operations.\n\n$0.000759 multiplied with 160,000 unused operations equals $121.44, which is the amount of the credit you can see deducted on the checkout page.\n\nThe credit amount cannot exceed the amount of your total bill.\n\nDowngrading your subscription\nTypes of downgrade\n\nYou can downgrade between plans and between tiers. Plans differ in features, and tiers refer to the number of operations.\n\nA downgrade can be:\n\nChanging from a higher plan to a lower plan, regardless of the tier (e.g. changing from the lowest tier in Teams to the highest tier in Core)\n\nChanging within the same plan to a lower tier (e.g. changing from 150,000 operations in Pro to 10,000 operations in Pro)\n\nChanging from an annual to a monthly subscription to a lower tier is a downgrade (e.g. changing from 240,000 operations per year in Pro to 20,000 operations per month in Pro).\n\nHow to downgrade\n\nGo to Dashboard > Subscription.\n\nChoose the plan you want to downgrade to. Choose the number of operations in your plan.\n\nIn the example below, the current plan is Teams with the minimum number of operations. So you can downgrade to any tier in Core or Pro.\n\nIn your new plan and tier, click Downgrade.\n\nA popup window appears. Click Downgrade to ... plan (the ... part changes according to your plan).\n\nCheck your billing info and update if necessary by using the edit button .\n\nClick Select payment method.\n\nUse the drop menu to select a payment method and click Proceed to payment.\n\nOn the Stripe checkout screen, review your details and click Subscribe.\n\nA notification pops up saying that your plan was successfully changed. Your new plan is highlighted on the subscription page.\n\nTransfer of unused operations\n\nIf you want to downgrade, we transfer your unused operations to the new downgraded plan in a 1:1 ratio. You can use the transferred operations in the new downgrade plan for the length of your new billing cycle:\n\n30 days for a monthly plan\n\n365 days for an annual plan\n\nFor example, you decide to downgrade from Pro plan to Core plan and you have 10,000 operations left. In the Core plan, you choose the tier with 150,000 operations/month, so in the first month of the downgrade, you have 160,000 operations available.\n\nFirst you use the operations within your subscription, then the extra/transferred operations. You can see the number of operations you have on your Dashboard.\n\nData is also automatically transferred with the operations. In Integromat operations and data transfer were separate.\n\nCanceling your subscription\n\nYou can cancel your subscription at any time.\n\nHow to cancel your subscription\n\nGo to Dashboard > Subscription > My plan.\n\nClick Cancel subscription.\n\nA new dialog opens. Click Cancel subscription to cancel.\n\nWe will send you a confirmation email similar to the following example:\n\nWhat happens after cancellation\n\nWe don't charge you for the next month, but you can still use your current subscription until the end of your billing cycle. After that, we switch you to the Free plan (assuming that you are not the owner of another organization with the Free plan).\n\nWe don't transfer your unused operations to that Free plan. You will have the standard Free subscription (i.e. 1,000 operations per month). This applies to both monthly and annual subscriptions.\n\nAbout canceling organizations\n\nYou can have only one free organization under your account.\n\nWhen you set an organization to a Free plan (either create a new free organization or set a current one to free), for the next one month it is not possible to set another organization to a Free plan.\n\nIf you have multiple organizations under your account and one subscription is already canceled, each subsequent organization you cancel is set as an organization without a license. You cannot run any scenarios under this organization until you subscribe to a new plan.\n\nExtra operations\n\nYou can buy extra operations at any time from your organization dashboard. Make consumes the operations included in your subscription first and then your extra operations. For example, if your subscription has 40,000 operations per month, you use those operations before consuming any extra operations you purchase. Operations 0 to 40,000 are your subscription. Operations 40,001 and onward are your extra operations.\n\nNote\n\nExtra operations also give you additional data transfer but do not impact other usage allowance parameters. See the information on our usage allowance policy for more details.\n\nHow to buy extra operations\n\nGo to Dashboard > Organization > Buy extra operations.\n\nYou can also access the same dialog via Dashboard > My plan > Buy extra operations.\n\nUse the + and - buttons to enter how many extra operations in units of 1,000.\n\nPrice per extra operation\n\nThe price for the extra operations is identical to the price per operation within your pricing plan and tier.\n\nFor example, if you are subscribed to a $9 plan and have 10,000 operations, 1 operation costs you $0.0009 ($9 / 10,000 operations). If you decide to buy 1,000 extra operations, it costs you $0.9 (1,000 operations * $0.0009). If you decide to buy 10,000 extra operations, it costs you $9 (10,000 operations * $0.0009).\n\nClick Select payment method.\n\nUse the drop-down menu to select a payment card.\n\nNote\n\nYou can only use credit/debit cards to pay for extra operations.\n\nClick Proceed to Payment.\n\nYou will see the extra operations on your dashboard.\n\nA notification briefly appears in the lower right. You can check your extra operations anytime on your dashboard.\n\nValidity of extra operations\n\nExtra operations are valid for the current billing cycle. For example, you have monthly billing and your billing cycle is from the first until the last day of the month. If you buy extra operations on the 20th, your extra operations are valid until the last day of that month.\n\nIf you have an annual plan, extra operations expire at the end of your billing year.\n\nImportant\n\nFor Core plan with an annual subscription, operations reset every month and your extra operations expire with the monthly reset.\n\nMonthly and annual subscription\n\nYou can choose between a monthly or an annual subscription.\n\nMonthly subscription\n\nIf you have a monthly subscription, your billing cycle is one month. For example, if you subscribe on 12 January, your next payment is due on 12 February.\n\nIf you have a monthly subscription, you get the monthly allocation of operations in the tier you choose.\n\nAnnual subscription\n\nIf you have an annual subscription, you pay the whole yearly amount up front and we allocate all the operations that belong in the specific plan and tier you chose. There is no monthly operations allotment, but the bulk of operations is available for you to use flexibly over the year.\n\nImportant\n\nWith the Core plan you always have monthly allocated operations, even if you have an annual subscription. Only Pro and Teams plans have an annual package of operations.\n\nChanging your billing cycle\n\nIf you change from a monthly to an annual subscription, and vice versa, we look at your current and future operations tier. The tier determines whether the action is an upgrade or a downgrade.\n\nChanging from a monthly to an annual subscription to an equal or higher tier is an upgrade (e.g. changing from 10,000 per month in Pro to 120,000 per year in Pro).\n\nChanging from an annual to a monthly subscription to a lower tier is a downgrade (e.g. changing from 240,000 operations per year in Pro to 20,000 operations per month in Pro).\n\nIn this section\nUpgrading your subscription\nDowngrading your subscription\nCanceling your subscription\nExtra operations\nMonthly and annual subscription\nChanging your subscription (upgrading, downgrading, or canceling)\nUpgrading your subscription\nTypes of upgrade\nHow to upgrade\nCredit\nDowngrading your subscription\nTypes of downgrade\nHow to downgrade\nTransfer of unused operations\nCanceling your subscription\nHow to cancel your subscription\nWhat happens after cancellation\nExtra operations\nHow to buy extra operations\nValidity of extra operations\nMonthly and annual subscription\nMonthly subscription\nAnnual subscription\nChanging your billing cycle\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

You can use up to 1,000 data stores per single organization, regardless of your plan. Note that the minimum size of one data store is 1 MB.\n\nMake calculates data storage based on the number of your operations per month. For every 10,000 operations per month, you get 10 MB of data storage.\n\nCustomers with operations flexibility on annual plans such as Pro, Team, or Enterprise receive their usage allowance based on monthly operations. For example, an annual plan with 1,200,000 operations for the year has a data storage maximum of 100 MB because there are 100,000 operations per month.\n\nIf you are on the Free plan, you have 1000 operations per month, which equals 1 MB of data storage and 1 data store.\n\nLegacy plan\n\nIf you are an existing Integromat customer, you can still keep using your Integromat plan on the Make platform. Your subscription price and the number of operations remain the same as before the upgrade, and the features are equal to Make Core plan.\n\nAdditionally to the old Integromat plan, you receive the following new features:\n\nMin. 1 minute interval between scheduled scenario executions\n\nUnlimited number of active scenarios\n\nAccess to 300+ Make API endpoints\n\n40 minute scenario execution length\n\nThis plan is called Legacy plan and you can see it on Dashboard > Subscription. Only former Integromat users can have the Legacy plan option.\n\nThe Legacy plan is available until you decide either to upgrade to any of the Make's plans, or cancel your Legacy subscription.\n\nWe always allocate operations monthly, and not annually for the Legacy plan.\n\nList of terms\n1000+ standard apps\n\nIn Make you can choose from over 1000+ ready-made apps to integrate and automate workflows.\n\nAccess to 300+ API endpoints (rate call limit/min)\n\nMake allows you to automate faster and at scale by integrating with one of 300+ public API endpoints of the Make platform.\n\nAccess to enterprise apps\n\nMake enables you to build powerful scenarios with access to exclusive enterprise-grade apps, such as enterprise-grade ERP systems: Automation Anywhere, Coupa, Greenhouse Recruiting, Infor M3 Cloud, Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM, NetSuite, SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud, ServiceNow, Workday Financial Management, and Workday Human Capital Management.\n\nIf this feature is enabled for your organization, you can activate all scenarios that include enterprise apps. Without this capability, you can see enterprise apps and build scenarios, but not activate or run them.\n\nAll enterprise apps are labeled as \"premium tier 3\" in Make.\n\nCompany single sign-on (SSO) access control\n\nSingle sign-on (SSO) allows you to use your own provider of user account management, authentication, and authorization services to register and log in to Make.\n\nYou can control access to Make by setting up your own OAuth2 or SAML2 compliant Identity Provider (IDP). Single sign-on works with Okta, PingOne, Google, Azure, and dozens of others.\n\nCreate and share scenario templates\n\nYou can create public or team templates which are scalable across business functions and user groups. Learn more about templates.\n\nCustom apps\n\nMake enables you to create and install your own custom apps and share these custom apps with others in your organization.\n\nCustomer support\n\nMake team helps you when you have trouble with our product. We make sure that you are successful in solving whatever issues you come upon.\n\nPricing plans differ in priority when it comes to customer support.\n\nCustom functions\n\nCreate your own Javascript functions and use them in scenarios to enhance Make's data transformation capabilities.\n\nCustom scenario properties\n\nAdd customizable metadata to your scenarios so you can organize them by the properties you create. For example, you can add information like a severity tier, client email, or a URL. Once added, you can use this information to filter and sort your scenarios.\n\nCustom variables\n\nEdit and manage your data across multiple scenarios at once.\n\nData storage\n\nMaximum storage capacity for all your data stores. Data stores represent persistent data storage and are a perfect tool for sharing and transferring data among your scenarios. Data is stored directly in your account, no registration at a third-party service is needed. You can have more than one data store, but the total amount of storage capacity will vary depending on your subscription.\n\nData transfer\n\nData transfer is the amount of data transferred through your scenario. Suppose you have a scenario that retrieves a 100kb image from FTP and reduces its size to 50kb and saves both images to Dropbox. The amount of data used in this scenario is 150kb.\n\nThe data moved between modules are counted only once, regardless of the number of modules deployed. The amount of data you have available depends on your subscription.\n\nDedicated customer success manager\n\nAccess to a personal Make advisor who provides onboarding, adoption, and best practice sharing to help you achieve your unique business goals.\n\nExclusive access to a list of premium partners for support\n\nWith this feature, you have exclusive access to a growing list of certified and experienced partners to support you with building workflows.\n\nExecution history full-text search\n\nFull-text search for scenario execution history makes it easier to find the right scenario execution and troubleshoot more effectively.\n\nNote: Enabling the full-text search is not retroactive. After enabling the full-text search, you can use the full-text search to find new scenario executions.\n\nExecution log storage (days)\n\nExecution log storage refers to the number of days that you can access detailed logs for every execution.\n\nHosting\n\nHosting refers to the location where we host the infrastructure that Make runs on.\n\nIncomplete executions store\n\nIn incomplete executions storage scenario stores executions that were not successfully finalized due to an error. Each incomplete execution contains the scenario's blueprint and all the bundles that can be mapped into the failed module. See incomplete executions for further information.\n\nInformation security compliance support\n\nOur information security team does a detailed security review to confirm compliance to standards such as ISO 27001 and SOC 2.\n\nMaximum file size (MB)\n\nThe maximum file size that can be automated and processed. The maximum size of a single file is limited according to your subscription.\n\nSome modules can accept a file in their input and/or yield a file in their output. If the maximum file size is exceeded, Make proceeds in accordance with the settings of the enable data loss option. See working with files for further information.\n\nMaximum number of active scenarios\n\nThe maximum number of scenarios that are active and running at one time. See active and inactive scenarios for further information.\n\nMaximum number of data stores\n\nData stores represent persistent data storage and are a perfect tool for sharing and transferring data among your scenarios. You may think of one data store as a worksheet in a spreadsheet. See data store for further information.\n\nMaximum scenario execution time (min)\n\nThe maximum time for which a single scenario can run. Maximum scenario execution time should not exceed 40 minutes for hosted version and 60 minutes for a private instance. See scenario execution, cycles and phases for further information.\n\nMinimum interval between scheduled scenarios (min)\n\nMinimum interval is the shortest possible time in-between two successive scenario runs. You can set the interval in the schedule setting panel.\n\nNo-code workflow builder\n\nMake visual no-code workflow builder enables you to design, build, and automate using our drag-and-drop interface.\n\nOn-prem agent ()\n\nWith the On-premise agent (On-prem agent) installed on your machine, your scenarios can access applications and databases on your local network without changing the settings of your firewall.\n\nOperations overage protection\n\nThis feature permits you to go over your allocated operations limit without worrying that your scenarios will cease to operate.\n\nOperations usage flexibility\n\nThis feature gives you the flexibility to purchase an annual package of operations upfront. Unused operations expire only after 12 months, so you don't have to worry about operations expiring every month.\n\nIn Core plan, you receive operations every month and they always expire at the end of the month. In Pro and Teams plan, you receive your operations at the beginning of the term so it is good to have a yearly plan to handle seasonality.\n\nParallel scenario executions\n\nWith parallel scenario executions, you can process multiple incoming items simultaneously, instead of one after the other.\n\nPriority scenario execution\n\nIn rare cases of high volume periods, Make executes your scenarios according to the priority of your plan tier to eliminate queuing time as much as possible.\n\nEach organization is assigned an execution priority. This priority identifies the order in which executions take place during high-volume periods.\n\nReal-time execution monitoring\n\nYou can view executions happening in real-time from within your browser.\n\nScenario inputs\n\nAllow everyone to run complex scenarios by just filling in inputs that are marked as required.\n\nSystem variables\n\nGet detailed information about your scenarios, current executions, teams, and organizations.\n\nTeams and team roles\n\nWith this feature, you can create and manage an unlimited number of teams in a single organization. Team roles enable granular permission rights and controlled user access to scenarios applications, templates, and connections within the shared teams' folders.\n\nTwo-factor authentication\n\nMake your Make account more secure using two-factor authentication (2FA). 2FA means that there are two different factors (your Make credentials and an additional verification code) needed to authenticate you as a user when logging into your Make account.\n\nUnlimited users\n\nYou can have an unlimited number of users in your organization. With Make you can share access with users in your organization to collaborate on workflows.\n\nWebhook queue size\n\nAll incoming webhooks are stored in a Webhook queue. The queue can start filling up when the scenario responsible for processing the webhooks is disabled (e.g. due to an error) or is processing the webhooks at a slower rate than they are being received. See instant triggers (webhooks) for further information.\n\nIn this section\nFeatures list\nUsage allowance\nLegacy plan\nList of terms\nPricing parameters\nFeatures list\nUsage allowance\nLegacy plan\nList of terms\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Now, the list includes operations used to resolve incomplete executions. Plus, the Make API endpoint for listing scenario operations usage also covers these operations.\n\nApps updates\n\nNew apps:\n\nSuiteDash - We're excited to announce a new powerful CRM tool integration with Make! This highly requested app allows you to manage contacts and companies directly within your SuiteDash account. Now, you can automatically create tasks, projects, and update client information in SuiteDash based on triggers from other apps. Additionally, this integration ensures that data for contacts, invoices, and project statuses are synced and up-to-date across all platforms.\n\nUpdated apps:\n\nYouTube - We’ve added new modules that will let you manage your videos, channels, and playlists.\n\nSugarCRM - In the advanced settings section, we’ve added a new field API Version that will allow you to enter the version you want to work with.\n\nOpenAI - Introducing Batch Modules! Now you can work in bulk with our app’s functionality. We've added five new Batch modules and an Upload a File module.\n\nSmartsheet - We’ve added a new Search Rows module.\n\nBigQuery - We’ve added a new Get Query Results by Job ID module.\n\nJune 14, 2024\nImprovements and changes\n\nWe created new Make API endpoints to help you monitor the usage of operations in your scenarios.\n\nGet scenario usage: Returns the daily operation usage for a specific scenario over the past 30 days.\n\nGet team usage: Returns the daily operation usage for all scenarios within a team over the past 30 days.\n\nGet organization usage: Returns the daily operation usage for all scenarios across all teams within the organization over the past 30 days.\n\nLearn more about them in the Make API documentation.\n\nWe updated the timezones for operations and data transfer in your organization and team dashboards. Instead of showing usage in GMT+0, the dashboards will now display data based on each user’s account timezone.\n\nThe organization and team dashboards now include data from incomplete executions, covering both operations and data transfer usage.\n\nWarning\n\nIf your Make scenarios frequently have incomplete executions, you may notice an increase in usage metrics on the dashboards.\n\nPreviously, it was not possible to open a scenario in a new tab from the Table view of the Scenarios tab. Now, you can right-click on a scenario from the list and select the option to open it in a new tab. Note that the Table view is only available for the Enterprise accounts.\n\nFixed issues\n\nWe resolved an issue where, in rare cases, scenarios were running indefinitely and blocking the processing of webhook queue items. With this fix, scenarios will no longer get stuck, allowing the webhook queue items to be processed smoothly.\n\nApps updates\n\nNew apps:\n\nSage Intacct - This app allows you to keep accounting, staff management tools, and reports in one place. Within Make, you can handle records in your Sage Intacct account.\n\nGoogle Ads Reports - This app is an integral part of Google Ads that is responsible for marketing reports based on data in your Google Ads account.\n\nUpdated apps:\n\nCeloxis - The API URL for Celoxis has been updated, ensuring all app parts and documentation reflect this mandatory change.\n\nCustify - The app documentation has been updated with revised module names and improved structure.\n\nJune 3, 2024\nImprovements and changes\n\nWe added a new read-only Audience URI field to the SSO settings, where you can find the path to the metadata.xml. This can be useful for setting up SSO on the provider’s side. Also, we included a link to the documentation in the SSO settings so that users can access the information more easily.\n\nApps updates\n\nNew apps:\n\nCrossbeam - This app helps you find potential partnerships among your customers and identify account overlap to uncover new leads and boost your sales.\n\nwatsonx.ai - This AI app lets you generate responses to a prompt using a variety of large language models (LLMs).\n\nUpdated apps:\n\nFirebase Cloud Messaging - It was required to enter additional credentials to create a connection before. Now you can just sign in to your Google account to work with Firebase Cloud Messaging and enjoy!\n\nStripe - In the beginning of June, Stripe will deprecate all API keys that you used to create a connection in Make. To prepare for this, we created a new connection type: Restricted API key. Don’t forget to switch to the new connection type to continue working with Stripe!\n\nGoogle Chrome (v2) - We’ve released version 2 of our Chrome app to align with the new API, so you can continue to send notifications through your browser.\n\nMay 3, 2024\nImprovements and changes\n\nWe’ve added a small but important improvement to the Users tab. Now you can filter users by their role at both organization and team levels. Simply click on the filter icon and select the role that you would like to see in the list.\n\nFixed issues\n\nRecently, when searching for modules in the scenario editor, the Instant tag was missing from instant triggers and they were mistakenly labeled as ACID (polling) triggers. This issue has been resolved, and it now works as expected.\n\nApps updates\n\nNew apps:\n\nGoogle Search Console - This app provides additional online marketing support to monitor and troubleshoot your website’s Google Search results.\n\nFlodesk - This app allows users to create visually engaging emails for designing and managing email marketing campaigns.\n\nApril 18, 2024\nFixed issues\n\nWhen rerunning an incomplete execution caused by an error in a route in a router, only the route where the error occurred would be executed while resolving the incomplete executions. Any subsequent routes would be ignored. Now, all subsequent routes are also processed when resolving incomplete executions.\n\nPreviously, custom functions couldn't handle parameters with binary data types, such as email attachments or pictures. This caused failures when trying to process files with custom functions. We fixed it and now you can successfully use custom functions to process raw binary data.\n\nApps updates\n\nNew apps:\n\nTikTok Conversions - Introducing an app that allows you to track conversion events that occur outside of TikTok and optimize your ads accordingly.\n\nTikTok Reports - With this app you can create detailed reports on the performance of your TikTok advertising campaigns.\n\nBigCommerce - Using this app you can manage your BigCommerce orders, carts, customers, products, and blog posts.\n\nAzure OpenAI - This AI app lets you generate images and create transcriptions, translations, and chat completions.\n\nUpdated apps:\n\nLinkedIn - A new module, Search Organizations, has been added to help you easily locate organizations by vanity name or email domain.\n\nLinkedIn Matched Audiences - Four modules have been deprecated due to a LinkedIn API change: Attach a Seed Audience, Create a Lookalike Audience, List Lookalike Audience’s Seeds, and Update a Campaign Target.\n\nDocumentation updates\n\nSometimes things don’t work as expected and you might see some errors in your scenarios. To make it easier for you to handle such events, we rewrote the whole Error section on the Help Center to make sure that you get all the information you need to resolve issues. Go check it out!\n\nApril 5, 2024\nImproved app search\n\nWe're excited to introduce our improved in-product app search designed to help you discover apps and build scenarios faster!\n\nWhat’s new:\n\nImproved search speed and reliability.\n\nApps related to your search query show up in the app search window with added insight into available modules.\n\nYour recently used apps move to the top for a speedy build.\n\nThe new right-hand bar gives you quick access to common tools and functions.\n\nWhile creating or editing the scenario you see a new section in the list of apps called Apps in scenario. It helps you get quicker access to already used apps.\n\nIf you want to learn more or leave feedback for this feature go to this Community post.\n\nApril 2, 2024\nImprovements and changes\n\nManaging and rotating SAML service provider (SP) certificates became easier for the Enterprise customers. Organization owners can now activate, deactivate, copy, and download SP certificates within the SSO settings. They can also see which certificates are active. When it's time to rotate certificates, users will receive a notification from Make, giving them time to schedule the switch and minimize downtime.\n\nAdditionally, we’ve extended the validity of SP certificates to three years, instead of just one.\n\nTo learn more, check out our SAML certificate management article.\n\nWe've updated the banners that let you know when you've reached your operations limit. Now, when you see one of these banners, you'll get all the details about your upgrade options right there. If you decide to upgrade or purchase more operations, you can just click the link in the banner.\n\nFixed issues\n\nMake built-in functions that use timezone information, like the addDays function, didn’t work in custom functions. We fixed the custom function’s context, so now you can use the date functions in your custom functions.\n\nApps updates\n\nNew and updated apps:\n\nOpenAI - We’ve added some new functionality to our OpenAI app. Not only can you generate an image using OpenAI modules, now you can also edit or extend an image with the new module called Edit an Image. Don’t forget to include transparency in the image file, or a mask layer, to make sure that the image can be edited later.\n\nAnthropic Claude - We’ve added a new module called Create a Message. Also, we now support the latest model Claude 3 Haiku.\n\nZoomInfo - This new app lets you manage companies, contacts, scoops, and more.\n\nConfluence - Our new productivity app will help you keep track of all your Confluence content, including pages and blog posts.\n\nDeel - We switched to the newest API version. Make sure to use the correct URL with the new API version when using the Make an API Call module. Also, the Create a Record module now allows creating the Global Payroll Contract and Contact for Contractors types of records.\n\nTiktok Lead Forms - This new app with an instant trigger allows you to trigger a scenario whenever you receive a new lead.\n\nCohere - With this new AI app, you can create conversations and classify texts.\n\nX (formerly Twitter) - Our app has a new name to match the recent rebranding.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nNew documentation added:\n\nsendSMS\n\nWhen I Work\n\nScrive eSign\n\nTextbelt\n\nNozbe Teams\n\nFavro\n\ncodeREADr\n\nFinolog\n\nRelatel\n\nToodledo\n\nMarch 13, 2024\nImprovements and changes\n\nPreviously, you could only filter and sort scenarios in the Table view. But now, you can also search for specific scenarios using the search bar in the upper left corner. This option is only available to Enterprise customers.\n\nThe template guided setup makes sure you don't miss any important fields when setting up each module:\n\nIt grays out Continue until everything is completed.\n\nThe green success badge only appears when you click Continue for a module.\n\nFixed issues\n\nClicking the Details button in the webhook queue resulted in an error. We fixed it, so you can see all the data that webhooks received.\n\nApps updates\n\nNew and updated apps:\n\nSalesforce Pardot - Salesforce Pardot is a marketing platform for email campaigns and lead management. Our app allows users to manage their records, files, and folders in their Pardot account.\n\nHighLevel LeadConnector - A new Watch Events module was added. It can be used as an alternative to Watch Contact and Watch Opportunities. Also we switched to API v.2 for this app, making sure that the overall experience is better.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nNew documentation added:\n\nSendlane\n\nKlenty\n\nBlink\n\nArtiBot.ai\n\nFilestage\n\nBillit\n\nUseINBOX\n\nStannp\n\nZenler\n\nLuxafor\n\nMarch 4, 2024\nImprovements and changes\n\nDuring guided template setup, filters now have setup status badges:\n\n your filter has unsaved changes.\n\n your filter is set up and ready.\n\nFixed issues\n\nCustom functions sometimes took too long to finish, which caused an error and disabled your scenario. We reviewed the timeout settings on custom functions. Before using custom functions, check the limits.\n\nWebhooks migrated from the Integromat platform sometimes returned a ConnectionError. We fixed the issue so your legacy webhooks remain stable.\n\nIn some cases, domain verification did not work for SSO domain claim. Verification now works as expected.\n\nSharable links to templates went to the organization dashboard. These links now go directly to the specific template.\n\nSwitching from one team to another sometimes resulted in an error message. Navigating to a different team now works just fine.\n\nDocumentation updates\n\nNew documents:\n\nUsing the OAuth2 Client Credentials grant with the HTTP module: We wrote a new tutorial on using an HTTP module with the Client Credentials grant type to get an access token.\n\nUpdated documents:\n\nHTTP: We updated the guidelines for creating JSON Web Tokens and making OAuth 2.0 requests. Follow clean steps and use embedded functions that we prepared for you.\n\nApps updates\n\nNew and updated apps:\n\nLeonardo.AI - This new app helps you generate images using the latest AI art generator, Leonardo AI, a popular alternative to Midjourney.\n\nTickTick - Manage your to-do lists and tasks with this helpful productivity app.\n\nGoogle Vertex AI (Gemini) - A powerful new app that can answer anything with the Create a Completion module using the gemini-pro model, as well as analyze image and video files with the gemini-pro-vision model.

The scenario then failed to create scenario logs. Now scenarios run smoothly and create scenario logs.\n\nImprovements and changes\n\nUsing templates to create scenarios is now much easier and more flexible.\n\nWe added an \"X\" icon that allows you to easily close the module settings. This means you can now open and set up modules in any order you prefer.\n\nWe introduced badges for each module to make sure you don't miss any important information:\n\n - a green badge indicates that all required fields are filled in.\n\n - an orange badge signals that you need to provide some additional information.\n\n - a gray badge reminds you that you still need to get started with setting up the module.\n\nOnce you complete the setup and all your badges turn green, you will see a side panel that gives you the option to run, edit, or schedule your scenario.\n\nWe renamed the add-on apps to community apps. In addition, on the Make integrations page, we show the number of scenarios that are using the community app.\n\nOn the Make integrations page, we show the verification badge for Make verified apps with their author and maintainer. This brings more clarity to who developed the app and who you should reach out to if you experience issues.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nNew app documents:\n\nDeel\n\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365 Business Central\n\nOracle Eloqua\n\nSAP Agent\n\nUpdated app documents:\n\nBasecamp 3\n\nFreshservice\n\nGoogle Cloud Text-to-Speech\n\nInstagram for Business\n\nSnowflake\n\nTwitter\n\nWordpress\n\nJanuary 29, 2024\nNew features\nDomain claim\n\nEnterprise customers can now claim and verify an email domain for their Single Sign-On (SSO) setup, allowing for SSO enforcement. Make recognizes users with the claimed email domain and prompts them to use SSO. See our article on domain claim for information on setup and provisioning options.\n\nImprovements and changes\n\nUsing a coupon for a higher plan now changes your subscription. Once the coupon expires, you automatically stay on your new plan. Or, you can manually downgrade to your original plan. See our article on coupons for details.\n\nFixed issues\n\nUnder the SSO option Default teams for newly created users, the list of teams showed deleted teams. This list now shows only valid teams.\n\nIt wasn't possible to delete records in a webhook queue: the Delete button wasn't clickable.\n\nThe infinite scroll in the scenario history wasn't infinite: it got stuck and didn't show all records. Now you have access to the full history.\n\nThe hints for creating names of custom functions and scenario inputs were incorrect. The hints now show the correct requirements for custom function and scenario inputs names.\n\nDoubled and unaligned texts appeared when you clicked the Create a connection button. We solved it, so you have beautifully aligned and correct texts.\n\nWhen you tried to resolve incomplete executions, the Run once button wasn't clickable. Also, a module that caused an error lost its mapping. We fixed both issues.\n\nMapping pills showed their raw name. Pills now have descriptive names.\n\nWhen you ran the Explain flow option and then deleted one or more modules, the dot showing the flow was stuck. We unfroze the dot, and now it shows the full flow (and takes into account the deleted modules).\n\nThe built-in option that Make uses to decode URLs in the output refused to decipher links. Now URLs in the output are legible and don't contain odd symbols.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nNew app documents:\n\nInstantly\n\nUpdated app documents:\n\nawork\n\nIntercom\n\nOpen AI (ChatGPT, Whisper, DALL-E)\n\nOutreach\n\nSalesforce\n\nTidycal\n\nJanuary 16, 2024\nNew features\nDynamic connections\n\nWith dynamic connections, you and your teammates use connections as scenario inputs. You can create a scenario with your connections, and your colleagues provide their connections to run the scenario. To learn more about how to use dynamic connections, check out the article in our Help Center. Dynamic connections are available for Enterprise plan users only.\n\nJanuary 11, 2024\nImprovements and changes\n\nA link to Make Community now appears in the sidebar Help submenu.\n\nEnterprise customers can now see their current subscription period and reset date on their organization dashboard.\n\nFixed issues\n\nThe list of users for both organizations and teams only displayed 10 users. User lists now include all members.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nNew app documents:\n\nIPQualityScore\n\nMemberful\n\nPingdom\n\nSALESmanago\n\nUpdated app documents:\n\nAttio\n\nBigQuery\n\nGoogle Keep\n\nGoogle Shopping\n\nGravity Forms\n\nKanbanize\n\nMicrosoft Power BI\n\nMicrosoft SharePoint\n\nPDF.co\n\nShopify\n\nSmartThings\n\nSquare\n\nTeamleader\n\nDecember 14, 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nThe link for the Resource Hub is now always in the left sidebar. No need to look for it in the submenus. Information and resources are now just one click away.\n\nA new email notifies you when you reach the limit on extra operations auto-purchasing. If you get this email, it means that you can only buy extra operations from your organization dashboard. The email has a link so it's easier to top up if needed.\n\nFixed issues\n\nPreviously, when you reduced the number of settings in the module settings window, it didn't automatically adjust its size. But now, the window shrinks based on the number of settings you have.\n\nWhen you were searching for an app to add it to the Favorites list, the search didn't show results. We fixed it: you can search for an app and get relevant results.\n\nAfter you tried to resolve the Incomplete execution, the diagram didn't load. This minor UX issue doesn't exist anymore.\n\nAfter you deleted a custom variable, an incorrect warning message popped up when you tried to save the scenario.\n\nThe Auto-align feature refused to align all modules in scenarios. Currently, it aligns all modules in your scenario.\n\nWhen signing in with SSO, Enter did not always work. It's fixed so you can stay on your keyboard when logging in and not bother with clicking.\n\nIn some cases, the list of organization members did not immediately update after inviting a new member. Invited members now appear as expected.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nNew app documents:\n\nInsightly CRM\n\nJobNimbus\n\nMixmax\n\nReamaze\n\ntimeBuzzer\n\nWistia\n\nUpdated app documents:\n\nAcuity Scheduling\n\nClickUp\n\neWay-CRM\n\nHubSpot CRM\n\nLooker Studio\n\nMicrosoft 365 Email\n\nNetSuite\n\nTally\n\nNovember 29, 2023\nFixed issues\n\nSome templates did not load values for arrays. Templates now display these values so you can edit and change them as needed.\n\nIn some cases, login failed with a 401: Access denied error. Login now functions normally.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nNew app documents:\n\nAtera\n\nFireflies.ai\n\nLinear\n\nUpdated app documents:\n\nCitrix Share File\n\nFreshmarketer\n\nGoogle Cloud Firestore\n\nGoogle Groups\n\nGoogle Tasks\n\nGoogle Translate\n\nLinkedIn\n\nNetSuite\n\nSlack\n\nNovember 16, 2023\nFixed issues\n\nWhen you import a blueprint, it now includes the scenario name.\n\nYou can edit Boolean values in Data stores.\n\nWhen you migrated from one zone to another (i.e. EU1 to US1), the Migration tool showed the wrong initial zone that you wanted to migrate from. Now the Migration tool shows the correct initial zone.\n\nTeam members who did not have a role and permission to delete members could see the Delete button. Now the Delete button only appears for team members with the Team Admin role.\n\nSeveral bug fixes and tweaks for Custom scenario properties:\n\nThere is now consistent behavior when adding and rearranging columns in table view.\n\nThe + Add property button didn't always appear. It now appears for all Enterprise customers.\n\nIf you went to the Scenario properties tab using a direct URL, you could not edit properties. It is now possible to edit custom properties after going to this tab via URL.\n\nTable view didn't always appear for Enterprise users who hadn't yet added a custom property. It now appears even when there are no custom properties.\n\nThe button to delete an organization sometimes appeared for users who weren't owners of that organization. Only owners can now see the Delete button for their organization.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nNew app documents:\n\nCircle\n\nFoursquare\n\nUpdated app documents:\n\nAbyssale\n\nMongoDB\n\nTeamleader\n\nZulip\n\nDocumentation updates\n\nError processing: we updated the list of increasing time intervals. This reduces the number of operations consumed when repeated attempts are made to execute a scenario with errors.\n\nChanging payment details and viewing invoices: we made changes to the information regarding what you should do when your payment fails.\n\nNovember 2, 2023\nFixed issues\n\nYou can now click on item pills to expand mapped items with subitems.\n\nThe Search items box in the mapping field didn't respond to user actions causing some glitches when you were typing or inserting text.\n\nDocumentation updates\n\nWe continue developing new documentation on Make, including errors. The 429 errors - rate limiting article explains how to handle this error, which appears when you reach the API rate limit for the app.\n\nUsing the On-premise agent: we added a couple of colorful and clear graphic schemes that explain the mechanism of the On-prem agent work.\n\nOctober 19, 2023\nNew features\nCustom scenario properties\n\nEnterprise customers can use custom scenario properties to help organize and sort scenarios. For example, you can add information like URLs, client email, business criticality, or anything else you like. See the Help Center article for more information.\n\nFixed issues\n\nModules that caused an error and had an error handler in the route didn't show a warning message.\n\nSeveral small UI fixes made Make more attractive:\n\nWhen renaming a module, you see all UI elements properly aligned.\n\nIf you assign a long name to a route, it is aligned in the Order routes window.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nUpdated app documents:\n\nAdobe Acrobat Sign\n\nCaspio\n\nFacebook Groups\n\nFeedly\n\nGoogle Drive\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nGoogle Translate\n\nRebrandly\n\nSquare\n\nTwitter\n\nDocumentation updates\n\nSomething new in Make Release notes: we made updates to some documents in our Help Center!\n\nFAQs: Due to the shutdown of Integromat on the 30th of September, we shortened the article and left only relevant questions. We added a link to the article where you can learn more about the current state of Integromat.\n\nIncomplete executions: We updated the procedure for resolving the Incomplete execution with another necessary step. The structure is clearer now, so it is easier to follow the whole process.\n\nOctober 6, 2023\nFixed issues\n\nWe tamed down our chaotic cursor: when you edit a formula with different functions, your cursor doesn't randomly move between the formula's elements.\n\nWere you confused by empty variable pills when mapping although they should have contained data? Don't worry, it was just a tiny visibility issue: now pills are full of color to show you that they contain data.\n\nWe get how frustrating it can be when a data store misunderstands your command: you wanted to edit a record but Make added a new record instead. No more confusion - you have your record edited and saved correctly.\n\nA module wrongly perceived an array as a string and didn't let you map the array's elements. We repaired this mechanism, so now the array's elements are available for mapping.\n\nAfter adding another module of the same app you already had in a scenario, it didn't pull up a connection for this app. It's not a problem anymore: Make now remembers the connection from the same app.\n\nSeptember 27, 2023\nFixed issues\n\nModules now handle different data types more gracefully. Data in all formats, from arrays to simple texts and numbers, are displayed correctly in the output.\n\nNobody likes an error, but when they happen, you need to know about it. We now ensure you have all the information about errors in your scenario logs.\n\nWe recently had an issue where Make was not allowing a new webhook to be created for the cloned scenario. We've fixed it, and now Make follows its own rules and assigns a separate webhook to each scenario.\n\nYour confidential scenarios are now safeguarded. Previously, there was a small concern with webhooks revealing data in their logs and queue. Now we have developed a fog-like covering for webhook's data, ensuring that it remains hidden.\n\nCalling all custom app users! Scenarios with custom apps can now be saved without any error popping up.\n\nThe clickable module ellipsis or three dots icon is back! You can now click it again to access additional options.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nNew app documents:\n\nAttio\n\nAlegra\n\nbexio\n\nCapsule CRM\n\nChatra\n\nDEAR Inventory\n\nDropcontact\n\nLinkedIn Lead Gen Forms - Events\n\nNetHunt\n\nPushbullet\n\nParseur\n\nRossum\n\nTalentLMS\n\nUpdated app documents:\n\nFluentCRM\n\nHubspot CRM\n\nOpenAI\n\nOracle Fusion Cloud ERP\n\nOracle Fusion Cloud HCM\n\nOracle Fusion Cloud Sales\n\nSlickText\n\nSugarCRM\n\nTwitch\n\nXero\n\nZoho CRM\n\nSeptember 11, 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nWe've made the router even sweeter by adding missing icons to the Order Route window.\n\nTreat yourself to a centered route name, so everything looks perfectly balanced now.\n\nFixed issues\n\nPreviously, cloning scenarios with custom apps and webhooks was like trying to clone a pineapple – it didn't quite work! We've cracked the code and now each scenario comes with its very own unique webhook.\n\nIf you needed to define a target structure type in the array aggregator, it got picky and showed the target modules fields selectively. Now you see all available fields.\n\nMake could not deal with migrated scenarios: they ran with an error that appeared without any reason.\n\nThe Migration tool refused to replace connections with ones created on Make.\n\nWebhooks had a strike and didn't allow you to edit them. Fortunately, we satisfied their requirements.\n\nMapping pills were stuck in the initial modules field, so you could not drag them to another field.\n\nApp documentation updates\n\nA bunch of new and updated app documents appeared in our Help Center. Take a look and keep on building scenarios!\n\nNew app documents:\n\nAdobe CC Libraries\n\nCheckr\n\nCloudinary\n\nGlide\n\nHotmart\n\niLovePDF\n\nMailmodo\n\nSamCart\n\nUpdated app documents:\n\nBox\n\nBubble\n\nGoogle Sheets\n\nMicrosoft SharePoint Online\n\nNotion\n\nOnceHub\n\nWebflow\n\nWix\n\nWorkday Human Capital Management\n\nWorkday Financial Management\n\nYandex.Translate\n\nAugust 25, 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nWe made our famous router much more attractive to the paparazzi:\n\nYou can set the order of all routes belonging to a specific router. No more time-consuming manual work: do it fast and easy and visualize on the scenario canvas.\n\nManage all the modules that follow a router in one click.\n\nNo more cut app names in the scenario builder: you see the full application name under the module.\n\nFixed issues\n\nMake mixed error messages up, but we fixed it. Now if a scenario fails to finish the initialization, you see a correct message.\n\nLanguages unite people! The webhook output supports languages with the non-Latin script.\n\nModules don't erase mapping after you click Save.\n\nHTTP OAuth2 and Email connections pretended they were zombies: you could see them in the Connections list, but sneaky 404 errors prevented you from making any changes.\n\nThe Migration tool played a bad game with you: it allowed migrating data stores that exceeded the allowed size in your organization on Make, but you didn't see any warning message beforehand.\n\nThe scenario activation toggle played dead, but we breathed a new life into it: turn your scenario on and off at any moment.\n\nWere you wondering where your On-prem agent disappeared? Actually, they were always on the On-prem agents tab, but now they are visible.\n\nWe noticed that extra operations auto-purchasing got confused by yearly plans with monthly limits. The auto-purchase would not reset month to month. Now, extra operations auto-purchasing works as expected for these organizations.\n\nA couple of bugs crept into the template builder and made some edge cases where:\n\nmapped values sometimes disappeared.\n\nunchecking Use in wizard wouldn't save correctly.\n\nWe squashed those bugs so you can confidently use the template builder now.\n\nAugust 10, 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nWe're not going to stop making our features even more awesome: the list of Connected systems became more comfortable to use on your mobile devices. We've added a charming little icon next to the connected system name shows you if it's connected to an On-prem agent.\n\nYou won't have any problems with understanding what the () function does: we added a clear description.\n\nWhen there's something strange in your scenarios, who you gonna contact? We've streamlined our help ticket process to automatically include your relevant information.\n\nFixed issues\n\nWe tried a new insect repellent out and killed a whole bunch of UI bugs:\n\nNow the scrollbar in modules is always visible even if you stretch the window.\n\nMailhooks don't pretend they are webhooks anymore: they have the correct icon in the webhooks list.\n\nThe Show advanced settings button is in its place again: the custom apps using the OAuth connection always have it.\n\nAll the data is in its place safe and secure! After the scenario migration to Make, mapping remains the same as it was in Integromat.\n\nThe Refresh form button doesn't erase mapping anymore.\n\nThe filter settings window is not a spoiled child: it works correctly and appears without a random error.\n\nMake is a good diplomat: it talked with app servers and agreed to show available settings options in some modules that refused to show them before.\n\nWe believe in second chances. A small bug kept members entirely from your organization. Now, a member who's not on any team can't access any scenarios or data but you can assign them to another team without adding them to the organization again.\n\nJuly 27, 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nWant more features from the Apps Code editor? We've got you covered! With this release, you get IML functions docs when you hover over them. If you try that with a custom IML function, you can use the pop-up to jump to the definition of the function.\n\nFixed issues\n\nIt is easy to mix-up a comma and semicolon, but we keep an eye on that: the formatNumber function has the correct example with a semicolon.\n\nSometimes Make insisted on saving the scenario in the edit mode when you already saved it. We calmed it down: no more annoying pop-ups.\n\nEmpty custom variables seem so useless, especially in functions! The issue is in the past: all custom variables contain relevant values wherever used in the scenario.\n\nAll fans of the Integromat DevTool don't experience its failure on custom domains anymore.\n\nThe rise of the machines is canceled: Make doesn't prevent you from extending your connections any longer.\n\nTiny, but an oh-so important UI fix: the route menu is as beautiful as everything else in Make.\n\nWe bet you don't need buttons that don't do anything, right? Don't be surprised by the absence of the Refresh form button in the scenario schedule settings.\n\nLonger looks better now. We tweaked the UI so lengthy organization names don't look ... awkward ... anymore.\n\nYou don't have to automate alone anymore. We squashed some bugs that got in the way of inviting collaborators into your organization. Now they can log in and get into your organization without any issues.\n\nHolmes would be proud. We cracked the case of the missing mapped values. Those values are back in your templates and won't disappear when you create Make\n\nJuly 13, 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nEven more useful data in system variables: we added a new Is incomplete execution variable that shows whether the scenario execution is a regular one or an incomplete one.\n\nAnd one more lovely variable: Execution type shows the way the scenario was executed. Possible values are:\n\nRun Once: the scenario was executed by clicking the Run once button.\n\nAPI-Triggered: the scenario was executed via API or manually if the schedule is set up as On demand.\n\nInstant: the scenario was executed according to the schedule. The scenario begins with a webhook, and is scheduled for Immediately.\n\nScheduled: the scenario was executed according to the schedule that is set up for any option except On demand and Immediately.\n\nFixed issues\n\nWere you ever wondering why Make asked you to save changes in the incomplete execution when you didn't change anything? We understand you: no more irritating messages appear without any reason.\n\nWe fixed the mod operator description: it reflects the operator's work correctly.\n\nNobody likes filters that don't filter anything, right? That's not the case anymore: if a filter contains a team system or custom variables, it does take them into account.\n\nMake Migration tool doesn't ignore Make limitations in custom apps names' symbols anymore: if the name contains more than 30 symbols, the Migration tool won't migrate it.\n\nIt had one job! In some cases, extra operations auto-purchasing didn't keep scenarios running. We squashed this bug and you trust our amazing extra operations auto-purchasing without any worries!\n\nThe mysterious case of the vanishing connection! Our templates used to play hide-and-seek with your existing connections, but we've given them a crash course on detective work. Now, you can easily spot and leverage your connections whenever you use a template. No more disappearing, case closed!\n\nIt had one job! In some cases, extra operations auto-purchasing didn't keep scenarios running. Don't worry, we squashed this bug and you can rely on extra operations auto-purchasing.\n\nThe mysterious case of the vanishing connection! Our templates used to play hide-and-seek with your existing connections, but we've given them a crash course on detective work. Now, you can easily spot and leverage your connections whenever you use a template. No more disappearing, case closed!\n\nJune 29, 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nOur Apps platform is getting stronger by the day. Developers can now enjoy an editor experience with all the bells and whistles: IML syntax highlighting, context-based suggestions, app code validation, and code folding.\n\nFixed issues\n\nNo missed connections; we always swipe right for you. In some cases, creating a connection resulted in a Connection action timed out error.\n\nUmm ... let's double-check that. The System variable Operations left value did not always return the correct value. We've got that variable back to its reliable self now.\n\nThe webhook log won't leave you in the dark with empty fields. We tweaked the webhook log to let you know when the body is too big or complicated.\n\nRun once was accepted into the Olympics for passing mapped values. It did some extra training and now always passes mapped values to other modules.\n\nWe squashed some template bugs to be more consistent and reliable.\n\nIt didn't look right but it worked. Mapped values in blueprints now display and work correctly.\n\nCorrected some tooltips to uncomplicate some mathematic operators. Now if we could just math easier in general.\n\nJune 14, 2023\nNew features\nOn-premise agent (beta)\n\nThe beta is here for Enterprise customers.\n\nWith the On-premise agent installed on your system, your scenarios can access applications and databases on your local network. The beta version features a module supported by an HTTP agent app. See the On-prem agent article for more details.\n\nImprovements and changes\n\nWe organized the organization dashboard. Does that make it a reorganization dashboard? Reorganization-ception? We don't know but buttons and information related to your subscription and extra operations are tidier and more logical now.\n\nDeveloping a custom app, now in color! We remodeled the code editor experience and improved syntax highlighting, code beautification and a new save button. Keep your hats on, more incoming in the next release!\n\nFixed issues\n\nPolling triggers using the Choose manually option were not updating with the correct epoch data value. We didn't even have to poll all of you to know that this incorrect data shouldn't be allowed to stay in office.\n\nWe know you all trust us to get things right, so we made sure our type conversions were on point. When mapping an array with a single item inside, no more empty results when you're expecting some sweet text value.\n\nGone are the days of sad- and awkward-looking columns that wouldn't scale. I guess you can say they're making a bigger thing out of it now.\n\nIs it supposed to look like that?! No, nobody wanted our logo in the two-factor authentication QR code to look like a rejected rugby ball design. That's why we changed it making sure it still does the job of keeping your account secure.\n\nMay 31, 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nClearer hints in the Incomplete Execution to let you understand the functionality better.\n\nImproved privacy and data protection during registration.\n\nThe affiliate dashboard now has more information on migrated organizations to improve clarity for commissions.\n\nUI tweaks for customers using a coupon trial to make billing easier to understand.\n\nFixed issues\n\nDid you set up a fallback route in your scenarios and then couldn't find it? We've found the issue, and fallbacks aren't reset randomly anymore.\n\nThe names of custom fields in your applications are now shown correctly when mapping: no more confusing numbers.\n\nWe like short links, but not cropped ones. In webhook logs, you can see all the data in webhook URLs, as before.\n\nDid it seem illogical to choose the date range for scenario scheduling if it ran just Once or On demand? We think so. Date ranges are no longer shown in these cases.\n\nIn a few cases, links to the Make help center incorrectly went to the legacy help center.\n\nMay 17, 2023\nNew features\nSleep therapy?\n\nNot quite but you will sleep easier knowing your critical scenarios won't stop if you run out of operations.\n\nExtra operations auto-purchasing lets your scenarios keep running after you reach your operations limit. See the article for details on how to enable extra operations auto-purchasing.\n\nImprovements and changes\n\nA new beautiful button for creating a connection in every application you might need to build a scenario:\n\nThe results in the full-text search became even more effective: as usual, you have the most relevant data at the top, but now the most recent results go first.\n\nLiking the new plan? Put a ring on it! UI tweaks to make it easier to keep a plan from a coupon.\n\nThere are new options when creating a scenario from a template. You can choose between the guided setup or quickly creating a new scenario. Guided setup now lets you skip the guided experience at any time.\n\nFixed issues\n\nNo more troubles with the formatDate function: it correctly considers the organization's time zone.\n\nLet your data stores work properly: if you add a new item to the data structure, the system no longer messes up its type.\n\nFlaky is only good for pastries. The Users tab of the Teams dashboard did not always display all Team members. Don't worry, we made it accurate and consistent.\n\nIt's an older promo code, but it checks out. Sometimes, shortened URLs for affiliate links copied source information from older promo codes. We've fixed this bug to make your tracking more accurate.\n\nSpell-Czech didn't catch it. The Installed Apps tab of the organization dashboard had a typo. We caught it and fixed it so everything is clear now, assuming you understand Czech.\n\nMay 03, 2023\nImprovements and changes\n\nNow a webhook can process all files it receives under the same key. But there is a little trick: you can find information about all the files in the collection named by the key, under the files array. Let's jump into an example:\n\nIn this example, the webhook received two files: image and image(1) under the picture key. Only the last sent file is shown in the picture collection. To see both files, expand the files array.\n\nBut don't worry: no need to urgently adjust your scenarios - you may leverage new functionality whenever you want.\n\nNo more issues with connecting to Twitter via OAuth2: use it as always! To start using the new Twitter application, just give Make your approval as an additional step - and it's done.

If you haven't migrated from Integromat to Make yet, it is the right time to do it with the help of our amazing tool.\n\nLong links are only good when we're talking about bratwurst, not URLs. Affiliates can now use TinyURL or other shorteners and still get information about the source of new users and organizations.\n\nNew address, who dis? You can now update your billing address when checking out. Just use the edit button and enter your new info.\n\nFixed issues\n\nAn iterator couldn't process variable values: now you have all data you need.\n\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA) became a little too excited and sometimes fully enabled itself before setup was complete. We had chat with it and 2FA promised to not do this anymore.\n\nAdding an app to favorites in scenario editor doesn't create an error message. It knows now that your favorite app exists.\n\nGet your inbox under control! We did some tweaks and fixes to the Email notifications tab of your Profile. Now you can count on changes being saved, the right people getting emails, and a more consistent UI.\n\nNo more mystery coupons! We've made everything clear in your organization dashboard to let you know when a coupon is active.

The first error or warning immediately sends an email. After the first error or warning, there is an interval as follows:\n\nErrors - Every 5 minutes, users receive an email with a link to their scenario history where they can access details of new errors.\n\nWarnings - Every 15 minutes, users receive an email with a link to their scenario history where they can access details of new warnings.\n\nThe Affiliates dashboard now has a direct link to promo assets.\n\nUS customers can now receive a sales tax exemption when applicable.
