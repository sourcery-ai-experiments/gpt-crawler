Connect your IT tools with Make to automate your workflows for everything from systems monitoring, to user account management, system documentation, and more.\n\nSee all use cases\nAutomate IT from A to Z with Make\n\nIT workflows are easy to ignore, until there’s a problem that requires a tedious, manual solution. Make helps you avoid common SNAFUs and process delays by connecting your tools to automate IT workflows.\n\nUse Cases\n\nExplore automated IT workflows\nSystem Monitoring\n\nWhen it comes to an IT system that powers your success, you can’t afford to let malware or mistakes take the system offline. Manual system monitoring exacerbates inherent challenges and makes it difficult to maintain system reliability and performance. Automated monitoring integrated into your IT systems actively prevents system failure while you’re free to focus on scaling the system.\n\nSEE USE CASE ->\nUser Account Management\n\nJust one user with the wrong access is a productivity or security risk. Automation for user account management tasks reduces the time you spend manually managing accounts for new users or reverifying permissions for specific people. Use Make’s solutions to augment your user management responsibilities, and even introduce AI.\n\nSEE USE CASE ->\nSystem Documentation\n\nManaging and updating system documentation can fall off the radar before you realize. With so many other priorities, outdated and incomplete documentation can become commonplace, creating confusion and preventing your team and customers from achieving their full potential. Automating system documentation keeps information moving forward without falling out of focus.\n\nSEE USE CASE ->\nCompany Data Management\n\nAs you grow, managing essential data manually can easily overwhelm your team. That introduces inaccuracies and can affect your essential records, reports and decision-making.

At the time of the launch, Make announced the shutdown of Integromat, and today reveals the official end dates of the platform and its support. \n\n\"In the past year, Make has helped the majority of our customers to successfully and smoothly upgrade from Integromat to Make - scenarios have been migrated in the hundreds of thousands, and our goal is to take all users on this journey,\" said CEO Fabian Q. Veit. \"With Make, we are reinforcing our commitment to helping our community overcome both small and larger business challenges by building meaningful solutions in an intuitive and playful way.\" \n\nHere are the important dates to be aware of:  \n\nFrom June 30, 2023, Make will discontinue support for Integromat. After this date, Make will not process any requests for Integromat assistance. \n\nFrom September 30, 2023, the Integromat platform will be shut down. At this time, all scenarios will be deactivated, and users will not be able to make changes to them without migrating to Make. \n\nIntegromat users and organizations who migrate to Make before September 30, 2023 will be set to Make’s Legacy plan, and will keep the same subscription price and number of operations. \n\nMore information about the upgrade can be found on Make’s upgrade FAQ page and upgrade documentation. \n\nTo upgrade to Make, Integromat users can click here.\n\nAbout Make\n\nMake is the leading visual platform for anyone to design, build, and automate anything — from tasks and workflows to apps and systems, without the need for coding skills.

With 1,000+ available apps - such as Workday, Greenhouse, ServiceNow, and Salesforce - and 6,000+ endpoints, Make lets you build and automate entire business processes in minutes and hours instead of days and weeks.\n\n“We love how simple it is for anyone to use Make. It promotes our cross-functioning team spirit and our own-it principle” said Andreas Wixler, CTO and Co-Founder of Finn, one of the fastest-growing startups in the automotive industry.  \n\nTraditionally, enterprises automating their business processes and workflows had to rely on cumbersome solutions such as Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which require scarce IT skills and are costly to maintain. However, with Make, non-technical and technical teams are empowered to connect apps and build critical business processes by using the power of an easy-to-use, drag and drop visual workflow builder.\n\n\"Make allows enterprise teams to be agile and creatively build visual solutions that solve everyday challenges in the workplace,\" said Marc Harpster, Global Lead, Startups, and Emerging Technologies at AWS Marketplace. \"Now AWS customers across the globe can easily procure Make’s visual automation platform from the AWS Marketplace, and seamlessly pay via their AWS bill.” \n\nMake enables organizations to easily unify and integrate their application stack in one single environment. Built with enterprise-grade security and compliance, Make allows teams across Marketing, Sales, Human Resources, IT, Operations, and Support to build and scale faster than ever before.\n\nTo learn more about how Make can help your organization, contact our enterprise sales team.\n\nAbout Make\n\nMake is the leading visual platform for anyone to design, build, and automate anything—from tasks and workflows to apps and systems—without the need for coding skills.

    "html": "Security Exploit Bounty Program\n\nResponsible Disclosure\n\nSecurity of user data and communication is of utmost importance to Make. In pursuit of the best possible security for our service, we welcome responsible disclosure of any vulnerability you find in Make. Principles of responsible disclosure include, but are not limited to:\n\nAccessing or exposing only customer data that is your own.\n\nAvoiding scanning techniques that are likely to cause degradation of service to other customers (e.g. by overloading the site).\n\nKeeping within the guidelines of our Terms Of Service.\n\nKeeping vulnerabilities secret until Make has been notified and had a reasonable amount of time to fix the vulnerability.\n\nYou are strictly forbidden from sharing any information regarding vulnerabilities you might have uncovered whilst working under the guide of the bug bounty program\n\nIn order to be eligible for a bounty, your submission must be accepted as valid by Make. We use the following guidelines to determine the validity of requests and the reward compensation offered.\n\nReproducibility\n\nOur engineers must be able to reproduce the security flaw from your report. Reports that are too vague or unclear are not eligible for a reward. Reports that include clearly written explanations and working code are more likely to garner rewards.\n\n \n\nSeverity\n\nWe are interested in security vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain access to user data. We will only qualify and reward a vulnerability if and only if the bug can be successfully used by itself or in combination with another vulnerability you report to access user data that is not yours. General \"bugs\" are never qualifying vulnerabilities, and anything that is not an exploit is a general \"bug\". The exploit must rely only on vulnerabilities of Make's systems. Issues may receive a lower severity due to the presence of compensating controls and context.\n\n \n\nScope\n\nEverything in the make.com domain space with the exception of the Out of scope list.\n\n \n\nOut of scope\n\nDMARC policy\n\nAutomated scanning tools (sslabs.com, Nessus, Qualys, …)\n\nDenial of Service vulnerabilities (DOS/DDOS)\n\nSocial Engineering, Phishing\n\nMixed-content scripts\n\nMissing Cookie Flags\n\nVulnerabilities that require a potential victim to install non-standard software or otherwise take active steps to make themselves be susceptible\n\nUser Enumeration\n\nPassword Complexity\n\nVulnerabilities on Third-Party Products\n\nSecurity Practices where other mitigating controls exist.\n\nCSRF with minimal impact i.e. Login CSRF, Logout CSRF, etc.\n\nSubdomain Takeover\n\nClickjacking\n\nSelf XSS\n\nEmail Spoofing - SPF Records Misconfiguration\n\nContent Spoofing\n\nStack Traces, Path Disclosure, Directory Listings\n\nSSL/TLS controls where other mitigating controls exist\n\nBanner Grabbing\n\nReflected File Download\n\nReports on Out of dated browsers\n\nHost header Injection without a demonstrable impact\n\nHTTP Trace Method\n\nRewards\n\nOnly 1 bounty will be awarded per vulnerability.\n\nIf we receive multiple reports for the same vulnerability, only the person offering the first clear report will receive a reward.\n\nWe maintain flexibility with our reward system, and have no minimum/maximum amount; rewards are based on severity, impact, and report quality.\n\nTo receive a reward, you must reside in a country not on sanctions lists (e.g., Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan & Syria, Russia). This is a discretionary program and Make reserves the right to cancel the program. The decision whether or not to pay a reward is at our discretion. \n\nContact\n\nPlease email us at bounty@make.com with any vulnerability reports or questions about the program."

    "html": "IT workflow automation: your ticket to efficiency\n\nNo matter how tech changes, stay scalable and streamlined by automating your IT workflows. Connect your IT tools with Make to automate your workflows for everything from systems monitoring, to user account management, system documentation, and more.\n\nSee all use cases\nAutomate IT from A to Z with Make\n\nIT workflows are easy to ignore, until there’s a problem that requires a tedious, manual solution. Make helps you avoid common SNAFUs and process delays by connecting your tools to automate IT workflows.\n\nUse Cases\n\nExplore automated IT workflows\nSystem Monitoring\n\nWhen it comes to an IT system that powers your success, you can’t afford to let malware or mistakes take the system offline. Manual system monitoring exacerbates inherent challenges and makes it difficult to maintain system reliability and performance. Automated monitoring integrated into your IT systems actively prevents system failure while you’re free to focus on scaling the system.\n\nSEE USE CASE ->\nUser Account Management\n\nJust one user with the wrong access is a productivity or security risk. Automation for user account management tasks reduces the time you spend manually managing accounts for new users or reverifying permissions for specific people. Use Make’s solutions to augment your user management responsibilities, and even introduce AI.\n\nSEE USE CASE ->\nSystem Documentation\n\nManaging and updating system documentation can fall off the radar before you realize. With so many other priorities, outdated and incomplete documentation can become commonplace, creating confusion and preventing your team and customers from achieving their full potential. Automating system documentation keeps information moving forward without falling out of focus.\n\nSEE USE CASE ->\nCompany Data Management\n\nAs you grow, managing essential data manually can easily overwhelm your team. That introduces inaccuracies and can affect your essential records, reports and decision-making. Prevent these problems by integrating your tools to automate data management workflows, with Make.\n\nSEE USE CASE ->\nHow FINN Built a Successful Car Subscription service with a Compact Team and Make\n\nAutomation is a key requirement to be price-competitive in the car subscription sector.
