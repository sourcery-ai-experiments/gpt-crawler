Array functions can, for example, search and sort the items in an array, perform mathematical operations, convert arrays to collections, reorder the items in an array, and more. Below is a list of supported array functions and a description what of each function does.\n\nadd (array; value1; value2; ...)\n\nAdds values specified in parameters to an array and returns that array.\n\ncontains (array; value)\n\nVerifies if an array contains the value.\n\ndeduplicate (array)\n\nRemoves duplicates from an array.\n\ndistinct (array; [key])\n\nRemoves duplicates inside an array. Use the key argument to access properties inside complex objects. To access nested properties, use dot notation. The first item in an array is index 1.\n\ndistinct( Contacts[] ; name )\n\n= Removes duplicates inside an array of contacts by comparing the name property.\n\nfirst (array)\n\nReturns the first element of an array.\n\nflatten (array)\n\nCreates a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into it recursively up to the specified depth.\n\nMore details about flatten function can be found at the Array.prototype.flat documentation.\n\njoin (array; separator)\n\nConcatenates all the items of an array into a string, using a specified separator between each item.\n\nkeys (object)\n\nReturns an array of a given object's or array's properties.\n\nlast (array)\n\nReturns the last element of an array.\n\nlength (array)\n\nReturns the number of items in an array.\n\nmap (complex array; key;[key for filtering];[possible values for filtering separated by a comma])\n\nReturns a primitive array containing values of a complex array. Allows filtering values. Use raw variable names for keys.\n\nmap( Emails[] ; email )\n\n= Returns a primitive array with emails.\n\nmap( Emails[] ; email ; label ; work,home )\n\n= Returns a primitive array with emails that have a label equal to work or home.\n\nSee also Mapping: Accessing array's elements by a key and our Extract an item and/or its value from an array of collections video tutorial.\n\nmerge (array1; array2; ...)\n\nMerges two or more arrays into one array.\n\nremove (array; value1; value2; ...)\n\nRemoves values specified in the parameters of an array. Effective only in case of primitive arrays of text or numbers.\n\nreverse (array)\n\nThe first element of the array becomes the last element and vice versa.\n\nshuffle (array)\n\nShuffles (randomly reorders) elements of an array.\n\nslice (array; start; [end])\n\nReturns a new array containing only selected items. The first item in the array has an index of 0.\n\nsort (array; [order]; [key])\n\nSorts values of an array. The valid values of the order parameter are:\n\nasc (default) - ascending order: 1, 2, 3, ... for type Number. A, B, C, a, b, c, ... for type Text.\n\ndesc - descending order: ..., 3, 2, 1 for type Number. ..., c, b, a, C, B, A for type Text.\n\nasc ci - case insensitive ascending order: A, a, B, b, C, c, ... for type Text.\n\ndesc ci - case insensitive descending order: ..., C, c, B, b, A, a for type Text.\n\nUse the key parameter to access properties inside complex objects. Use raw variable names for keys. To access nested properties, use dot notation. The first item in an array is index 1.\n\nExample 2. sort( Contacts[] ; name )\n\nSorts an array of contacts by the name property in default ascending order.\n\n\n\n\nExample 3. sort( Contacts[] ; desc ; name )\n\nSorts an array of contacts by the name property in descending order.\n\n\n\n\nExample 4. sort( Contacts[] ; asc ci ; name )\n\nSorts an array of contacts by the name property in case insensitive ascending order.\n\n\n\n\nExample 5. sort( Emails[] ; sender.name )\n\nSorts an array of emails by the sender.name property.\n\n\n\n\ntoArray (collection)\n\nConverts a collection into an array of key-value collections.\n\ntoCollection (array; key; value)\n\nConverts an array containing objects with key-value pairs into a collection.\n\nIn this section\nadd (array; value1; value2; ...)\ncontains (array; value)\ndeduplicate (array)\ndistinct (array; [key])\nfirst (array)\nflatten (array)\njoin (array; separator)\nkeys (object)\nlast (array)\nlength (array)\nmap (complex array; key;[key for filtering];[possible values for filtering separated by a comma])\nmerge (array1; array2; ...)\nremove (array; value1; value2; ...)\nreverse (array)\nshuffle (array)\nslice (array; start; [end])\nsort (array; [order]; [key])\ntoArray (collection)\ntoCollection (array; key; value)\nArray functions\nadd (array; value1; value2; ...)\ncontains (array; value)\ndeduplicate (array)\ndistinct (array; [key])\nfirst (array)\nflatten (array)\njoin (array; separator)\nkeys (object)\nlast (array)\nlength (array)\nmap (complex array; key;[key for filtering];[possible values for filtering separated by a comma])\nmerge (array1; array2; ...)\nremove (array; value1; value2; ...)\nreverse (array)\nshuffle (array)\nslice (array; start; [end])\nsort (array; [order]; [key])\ntoArray (collection)\ntoCollection (array; key; value)\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

For example, math functions let you get an average of an array, round a value up or down, or change the format of a number (1 000 000 to 1,000,000 or 1.000.000).

Let us assume you would like to send five emails with subjects \"Hello 1\", \"Hello 2\", ... \"Hello 5\". This could be accomplished with connecting Email > Send me an email module after the Repeater module:\n\nWith modules configured as follows:\n\nYou can imagine the Repeater module as a generator of bundles outputting one bundle after another. Each bundle contains one item named i of type Number. The initial value of the i item is specified in the Initial value field. The number of repetitions (= number of outputted bundles) is specified in the Repeats field. The value of the i item is increased in each repetition by the value specified in the Step field, which is 1 by default (tick the Show advanced settings checkbox to reveal it).\n\nIterator\n\nIterator is a special type of module that converts an array into a series of bundles. Each array item will output as a separate bundle.\n\nSetting up an iterator\n\nSetting up an iterator is done in the same way as setting any other module. The Array field contains the array to be converted/split into separate bundles.\n\nExamples:\nSAVE EMAIL ATTACHMENTS TO GOOGLE DRIVE\n\nThe scenario below shows how to retrieve emails with attachments and save the attachments as single files in a selected Google Drive folder.\n\nEmails can contain an array of attachments. The Iterator module inserted after the first module enables you to handle each attachment separately. The Iterator splits the array of attachments into single bundles, each bundle with one attachment will then save one at a time in a selected Google Drive folder. The Iterator module set up is shown above - the Array field should contain the Attachments[] array.\n\nSPECIALIZED ITERATORS\n\nFor your convenience, many Make apps offer specialized iterator modules with a simplified setup. For example, the Email app contains the special iterator Email > Iterate attachments that will produce the same results as the general Iterator without having to specify the array, just the source module.\n\nLearn when to use an Iterator in your scenarios\n\nThe video below is module 1 of the 3 part lesson titled Iterator and Array Aggregator. It explains the purpose of the Iterator and the Array Aggregator and with the help of a sample scenario, explains when to use an Iterator and what to do with the output.\n\nTroubleshooting: Mapping panel does not display mappable items under the Iterator module\n\nWhen an Iterator does not have information about the structure of the array's items, the mapping panel in the modules following the Iterator will display only two items under the Iterator: Total number of bundles and Bundle order position:\n\nThe reason for this is that in Make each module is responsible for providing information about items it outputs so these items can be properly displayed in the mapping panel in the following modules. However, there are several modules that might be unable to provide this information in some cases, e.g. JSON > Parse JSON or Webhooks > Custom Webhook modules with missing data structure.\n\nThe solution is to manually execute the scenario to make the module learn about the items it outputs so it can provide the information to the following modules.\n\nFor example, if you have a JSON > Parse JSON module without a data structure as below:\n\nAnd then if you connect an Iterator module to it, you will not be able to map the output of the module to the Array field in the setup panel of the Iterator:\n\nTo resolve this, just manually start the scenario in the Scenario editor. You can un-link the modules after the JSON > Parse JSON module to prevent the flow from proceeding further or right-click the JSON > Parse JSON module and choose \"Run this module only\" from the context menu to execute only the JSON > Parse JSON module.\n\nOnce the JSON > Parse JSON has been executed, it learns about the items it outputs and provides this information to all the following modules including the Iterator. The mapping panel in the Iterator's setup will then display the items:\n\nMoreover, the mapping panel in the modules connected after the Iterator will display the items contained in the array's items:\n\nIn summary: if you cannot see some items in a module's mapping panel, simply run the scenario once so all the modules can learn about the items they output and provide this information to the following modules.\n\nArray aggregator\n\nArray aggregator is an aggregator module, which allows to merge several bundles into one single bundle. The following image shows a typical setup of the Array aggregator module.\n\nSource Module\n\n\t\n\nThe module from which the bundle aggregation will start. The source module is usually an iterator or a search module that outputs a series of bundles. Once you setup the aggregator's Source Module (and close the aggregator's setup), the route between the source module and the aggregator will be wrapped in a grey area to visualize the start and the end of the aggregation.\n\n\n\n\nTarget structure type\n\n\t\n\nThe target structure into which the data shall be aggregated. The default option is Custom that enables you to choose items that should be aggregated into the Array aggregator's output bundle's Array item:\n\nOnce you connect more modules after the Array aggregator module and get back to the module's setup, the Target structure type dropdown will contain all the following modules and their fields that are of type Array of Collections, like e.g. Attachments field of the Slack > Create a Message module:\n\nThe video below explains how the modules connected after an Array aggregator affects the content of Target structure type dropdown:\n\n\n\n\nGroup by\n\n\t\n\nThe aggregator's output can be split into several groups with the help of the Group by field. The Group by field can contain a formula that is evaluated for each aggregator's input bundle. The aggregator then outputs one bundle per each distinct formula's value. Each bundle contains two items:\n\nKey contains the distinct value.\n\nArray contains the aggregated data from the bundles for which the formula evaluated to the Key value.\n\n\n\n\nStop processing after an empty aggregation\n\n\t\n\nBy default, the aggregator outputs the result of the aggregation even in case no bundles reached the aggregator (e.g. because they have been all filtered out on their way). If the Stop processing after an empty aggregation option is enabled, the aggregator will not produce any output bundle in this case and the flow will stop.\n\nCaution\n\nBundles outputted from the source module and any other modules between the source module and the aggregator module are not outputted by the aggregator and thus items in these bundles are not accessible by the modules in the flow after the aggregator.\n\nIf you need to access items from bundles outputted from the source module and any other modules between the source module and the aggregator module, make sure to include them in the Aggregated fields field in the setup of the Array aggregator module.\n\nIf items are nested (i.e. contained in a collection item) they currently cannot be easily selected in the Array aggregator's Aggregated fields field. For example, if bundles contain collection item User with two items Name and Email:\n\nThen only the User collection item can be selected:\n\nThis setup will produce the following output:\n\nCustomizing the output\n\nIf you wish to fully customize the Array aggregator's output structure, proceed as follows:\n\nInsert the JSON > Create JSON module after the Array aggregator module:\n\nOpen the JSON > Create JSON module's setup.\n\nSetup a Data structure for the items you want to be outputted from the Array aggregator. The Data structure should be an array of collections and the collections should contain the items you want to include in the output. Here is a sample Data structure with two text items Name and Email:\n\nOpen the Array aggregator module's setup.\n\nIn the Target structure type field, choose the JSON > Create JSON module's array field:\n\nFields corresponding to the Data structure created in step 3 will appear in the setup of the Array aggregator module. Map any items into the fields as you see fit. You can now easily map nested items using the mapping panel and even use formulas:\n\nThe Array aggregator module's output will now look like this:\n\nIf you wish to save the operation performed by the dummy JSON > Create JSON module, just put it on a disabled route after a Router:\n\nIf you wish to conditionally omit an item from the module's output, use a formula that evaluates to ignore keyword:\n\nIf the 4. User: Email is empty then the Email item will be completely omitted from the output:\n\nLearn when to use an Array Aggregator in your scenarios\n\nThe video below is module 2 of the 3 part lesson titled Iterator and Array Aggregator. It is a continuation of module 1 (video link) and using a sample scenario, explains when to use an Array aggregator and what to do with the output.\n\nIn this section\nRepeater\nIterator\nArray aggregator\nFlow control\nRepeater\nIterator\nSetting up an iterator\nLearn when to use an Iterator in your scenarios\nArray aggregator\nCustomizing the output\nLearn when to use an Array Aggregator in your scenarios\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Webhooks create a URL that you can call from an external app or service, or from another Make scenario. Use webhooks to trigger the execution of scenarios.\n\nWebhooks usually act as instant triggers. Contrary to scheduled triggers, which periodically ask a given service for new data to be processed, webhooks execute the scenario immediately after the webhook URL receives a request.\n\nMake supports the following types of webhooks:\n\nApp-specific webhooks listen for data coming out of a specific app, also called instant triggers.\n\nCustom webhooks allow you to create a URL to which you can send any data.\n\nCreating app-specific webhooks\n\nMany apps provide webhooks to execute scenarios whenever a certain change occurs in the app. These are called instant triggers. Instant triggers are marked with the label \"INSTANT\" in the list of an app's modules:\n\nIf an app does not provide webhooks, use polling triggers to periodically poll the service for new data.\n\nCreating custom webhooks\n\nTo create a webhook, you must insert the Custom webhook module to a scenario.\n\nNote\n\nEach scenario must use its own webhook. You can not use one webhook in multiple scenarios.\n\nInserting webhooks to scenarios\n\nInsert the Custom Webhook module from the Webhooks app.\n\nIn the module's settings, click Add.\n\nSet the webhook's name and other settings, then click Save.\n\nMake generates a URL and starts listening for requests to this URL. Send a request to this URL to have Make automatically determine the data structure for this webhook. See setting up webhook data structure below for more details.\n\nNote\n\nYou can access the webhook's details and change the webhook's settings in the Webhooks section in the left menu.\n\nSetting up webhook data structure\n\nOptionally, you can let Make know what data structure to expect in the webhook request payload. Make can use data structures to validate the incoming data. If you do not set up a data structure, Make will pass the incoming data to subsequent modules in your scenario without any validation.\n\nTo enable validating incoming data, set up the webhook's data structure in one of the following ways:\n\nCreate a new data structure manually in the Data structures section.\n\nUse an existing data structure.\n\nYou can also use the following methods to let Make know what data structure to expect.\n\nNotice\n\nNote that these methods do not enable data validation. The data structure set up in this way only helps with mapping the webhook data to subsequent modules in your scenario.\n\nCreate a data structure immediately after creating the webhook by calling the webhook URL with sample data in the request body.\n\nRe-determine the data structure of an existing webhook going to the Webhook module settings, clicking Re-determine data structure, and calling the webhook URL with sample data in the request body.\n\nIf you call the webhook URL to automatically determine or re-determine the data structure, Make does not create a reusable data structure in the Data structures section. The data structure determined in this way is stored internally with the particular webhook. In this case, Make does not validate incoming data.\n\nScheduling webhooks processing\n\nBy default, when Make receives data on a webhook, your scenario executes immediately. If you don't want to run your scenario immediately after a webhook receives data, you can schedule your scenario to process all webhook requests periodically.\n\nEdit the scenario which is triggered by your webhook.\n\nEdit the scenario schedule settings.\n\nOR\n\nEdit the schedule settings of the webhook module.\n\nSet up your desired schedule.\n\nWhen a scheduled webhook receives data, Make stores the data in the webhook's queue. The whole queue is then processed every time your schedule criteria are met.\n\nHow Make processes webhooks\n\nWhen a webhook receives a request, the system stores the request in the webhook's queue. Each webhook has its own queue. Go to the Webhooks section in the left menu to view all webhooks and their queues.\n\nParallel vs. sequential processing\n\nIf you are using instant webhooks, Make starts processing each request immediately as the request is received. By default, scenarios with instant webhooks are processed in parallel. Even if a previous scenario execution is still being processed, Make does not wait for its processing to complete.\n\nYou can inspect all running executions in the scenario detail. Click an item in the list of running executions to view the graphical representation of that particular execution. The execution that is currently displayed is marked with an eye icon.\n\nTo turn off parallel processing, open the settings of your scenario and select Sequential processing. With sequential processing enabled, Make waits until the previous execution is complete before starting the next one. Also, use sequential processing when you need to process your webhook requests in the order that they came in.\n\nProcessing scheduled webhooks\n\nIf you are using scheduled webhooks, requests accumulate in the queue until the schedule criteria are met. When schedule criteria are met, Make processes the queued requests based on the Maximum number of results that you set for the webhook.\n\nFor example, if your scenario is scheduled to run every hour and your Maximum number of results is set to the default value of 2, Make processes two items from the queue every hour. If your webhook queue is filling up with requests, increase the Maximum number of results or adjust the schedule to execute the scenario more often.\n\nNote\n\nInstant trigger modules have the Maximum number of cycles parameter instead of the Maximum number of results.\n\nSet the Maximum number of cycles in the instant trigger modules to get the same data processing behavior as is with webhooks and the Maximum number of results parameter.\n\nWebhook queue details\n\nWhen data arrives to a webhook and the call is not processed instantly, Make stores it in the webhook processing queue.\n\nThe limit for the number of webhook queue items depends on your usage allowance, which is a part of your subscription. For every 10,000 operations licensed per month, you can have up to 667 items in each webhook's queue. The maximum number is 10,000 items in the webhook's queue.\n\nWhen the webhook queue is full, Make rejects all incoming webhook data which is over the limit.\n\nIncoming webhook data is always stored in the queue regardless of the data is confidential option settings. As soon as the data is processed in a scenario, it is permanently deleted.\n\nView webhook queue\n\nTo view the content of the queue, follow the steps below.\n\nGo to the Webhooks section in the left menu.\n\nFind the webhook whose queue you want to view.\n\nClick the specific webhook on the list to inspect its details.\n\nYou can see:\n\nWebhook status\n\nWebhook URL and webhook UDID (unique webhook identifier)\n\nStatus of your scenario\n\nScenario ID and scenario URL\n\nTo see the webhook's queue, click Queue.\n\nYou can also click the button with the truck icon on the Webhooks page.\n\nThe webhook's queue displays.\n\nClick Detail by the webhook you want to inspect.\n\nYou can see the parsed items.\n\nExpiration of inactive webhooks\n\nMake automatically deactivates webhooks that are not connected to any scenario for more than 5 days (120 hours). The hook return 410 Gone status code.\n\nDelete webhook item from a queue\n\nGo to the Webhooks section in the menu on the left.\n\nClick the button with the truck icon to see the webhook's queue.\n\nThe webhook's queue displays.\n\nTick the box on the left in front of the entries you want to delete.\n\nClick Delete selected to delete the chosen webhook(s).\n\nTo delete all, tick the first box on the left and then Delete all.\n\nClick OK to confirm.\n\nYou have deleted the incoming webhook item(s) from the queue.\n\nWebhook logs\n\nMake stores webhook logs for 3 days. For the organizations on the Enterprise plan,Make keeps the webhook logs for 30 days. Make deletes logs older than other retention limit.\n\nTo view webhook logs, follow the steps below.\n\nGo to the Webhooks section in the menu on the left.\n\nClick the specific webhook on the list to inspect its details.\n\nClick Logs.\n\nYou can see:\n\nStatus of the webhook call (success, warning, error, or all)\n\nTo filter the webhook logs by status, click the filter icon.\n\nDate and time of the incoming webhook\n\nTo sort the webhook log by date and time, click the arrow.\n\nWebhook execution log size\n\nTo see the detail of the specific webhook log, click Detail.\n\nYou can see:\n\nWebhook request (timestamp, URL, method, headers, query, body)\n\nWebhook response (status, headers, body)\n\nParsed items\n\nParsed items combine the query parameters and body of the webhook request in one bundle.\n\nWebhook settings\n\nTo adjust a webhook's settings, click Webhooks in the left menu and Edit a webhook.\n\nSetting\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nIP restrictions\n\n\t\n\nA whitelist of IP addresses delimited by comma. Only webhook requests that come from the specified IPs will be processed. Use CIDR notation to whitelist a subnet. Leave empty if you want to allow requests from all IPs.\n\n\n\n\nData structure\n\n\t\n\nSelect an existing data structure or create a new data structure for the webhook. Make will use the data structure to validate the incoming data. Requests that don't pass validation will be rejected with HTTP status code 400.\n\n\n\n\nGet request headers\n\n\t\n\nExtracts headers data from the webhook request and makes the data available for mapping in the scenario.\n\n\n\n\nGet request HTTP method\n\n\t\n\nExtracts the HTTP method from the request and makes the method available for mapping in the scenario.\n\n\n\n\nJSON pass-through\n\n\t\n\nPasses JSON payloads to subsequent modules in the scenario as a text string, as opposed to breaking the payload down into mappable fields.\n\nError Handling\n\nWhen there is an error in your scenario with a webhook, the scenario:\n\nstops immediately - when the scenario is set to run Immediately.\n\nstops after 3 unsuccessful attempts (3 errors) - when the scenario is set to run as scheduled.\n\nIf your scenario contains a Webhook response module, the error is sent to the Webhook response. The webhook response module is always executed last, unless you enable auto commit in scenario settings.\n\nSupported incoming data formats\n\nMake supports the following formats of incoming data:\n\nQuery string\n\nForm data\n\nJSON\n\nIf a webhook receives data in both the query string and either form data or JSON data at the same time, the system combines the data into a single bundle. If the request contains duplicate data in different formats, the query string takes precedence and overwrites the data that was received in the other formats. We recommend you do not duplicate data in query strings, form data, and JSON.\n\nQuery String\nGET \nhttps://hook.make.com/yourunique32characterslongstring?name=Make&amp;job=automate\nForm Data\nPOST \nhttps://hook.make.com/yourunique32characterslongstring\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nname=Integrobot&job=automate\nMultipart\nPOST \nhttps://hook.make.com/yourunique32characterslongstring\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---generatedboundary\n\n---generatedboundary\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"file.txt\"\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\nContent of file.txt\n---generatedboundary\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"name\"\nMake\n---generatedboundary\n\nIn order to receive files encoded with multipart/form-data, it is necessary to configure a data structure with a  collection type field that contains the nested fields   name, mime and data. The field name is a text type and contains the name of the uploaded file. The mime is a text type and contains a file in the [MIME] format. The field data is a buffer type and contains binary data for the file being transferred.\n\nJSON\nPOST \nhttps://hook.make.com/yourunique32characterslongstring\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\"name\": \"Integrobot\", \"job\": \"automate\"}\n\nTo access the original JSON, open the webhook's settings and enable the JSON pass-through option:\n\nThe maximum allowed webhook's payload size (Content-Length) is 5 MB (5.242.880 bytes) regardless of the subscription tier.\n\nWebhook headers\n\nTo access the webhook's headers, enable the Get request headers option in the webhook's setup:\n\nYou can then extract a particular header value with the combination of map() & get() functions. The example below shows a formula that extracts the value of the authorization header from the Headers[] array. The formula is used in a filter that compares the extracted value with the given text to pass only webhooks if there is a match.\n\nResponding to webhooks\n\nThe default response to a webhook call contains just a simple text, \"Accepted\". The response is returned to the webhook's caller right away during the execution of the Custom Webhook module. You can easily test it like this:\n\nPlace the Custom Webhook module in your scenario.\n\nAdd a new webhook in the module's configuration.\n\nCopy the webhook's URL to your clipboard.\n\nRun the scenario - the Custom Webhook module should be waiting for the webhook call (see on the right)\n\nOpen a new browser window, paste the copied URL in the address bar and press Enter.\n\nThe Custom Webhook module will be triggered and the browser will display the following page:\n\nThese are default responses when the scenario does not contain the Webhook Response module:\n\n\t\n\nHTTP status code\n\n\t\n\nBody\n\n\n\n\nWebhook accepted in the queue\n\n\t\n\n200\n\n\t\n\nAccepted\n\n\n\n\nWebhook queue full\n\n\t\n\n400\n\n\t\n\nQueue is full.\n\nIf you wish to customize the webhook's response, employ the module Webhook Response. The configuration of the module contains two fields: Status and Body. The Status field should contain HTTP response status codes like 2xx for Success (e.g.200 for OK), 3xx for Redirection (e.g.307 for Temporary Redirect), 4xx for Client errors (e.g. 400 for Bad Request), etc. The Body field should contain anything that will be accepted by the webhook's call. It can be a simple text, HTML, XML, JSON, etc. It is advisable to set the Content-Type header to the corresponding mime type: text/plain for plain text, text/html for HTML, application/json for JSON, application/xml for XML, etc.\n\nThese are additional default responses when the scenario does contain the Webhook Response module:\n\n\t\n\nHTTP status code\n\n\t\n\nBody\n\n\n\n\nScenario encounters an error\n\n\t\n\n500\n\n\t\n\nScenario failed to complete.\n\nThe timeout for sending a response is 40 seconds. If the response is not available within that period, Make returns a '200 Accepted' status.\n\nHTML Response example\n\nConfigure the Webhook Response module as follows:\n\nStatus\n\n\t\n\n2xx success HTTP status code, e.g. 200\n\n\n\n\nBody\n\n\t\n\nHTML code, e.g.:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<title>Thank you!</title>\n</head>\n<body>Thank you, {{1.name}}, for your request!\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\n\nCustom headers\n\n\t\n\nKey\n\n\t\n\nContent-type\n\n\n\n\nValue\n\n\t\n\ntext/html\n\nIt will produce an HTML response that will be displayed like this in a web browser:\n\nRedirect example\n\nConfigure the Webhook Response module as follows:\n\nStatus\n\n\t\n\n3xx redirection HTTP status code, e.g. 303\n\n\n\n\nCustom headers\n\n\t\n\nKey\n\n\t\n\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nValue\n\n\t\n\nThe URL you would like to redirect to.\n\nCustom mailhook\n\nMailhook is an instant trigger module that can be triggered by sending an email to the email address generated by this module.\n\nMailhook attachment size limit\n\nThe maximum size of an email, including its attachments, that you send to a mailhook is 25 MB.\n\nExample Of Use\n\nMailhook will monitor your incoming emails without the need to have a scheduled run of the scenario.\n\nAdd the Custom mailhook to your scenario (Webhooks > Custom mailhook).\n\nGenerate a mailhook email address, and copy the address to the clipboard.\n\nSave and run the scenario.\n\nOpen your email account settings, and configure forwarding. Use the email address generated by the Custom mailhook module in step 2 (above) as the forwarding address.\n\nFor Gmail:\n\nClick the cogwheel () in the top-right corner, and then click See all settings.\n\nOpen the Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab.\n\nClick the Add a forwarding address button.\n\nEnter the email address you have generated and copied in step 2 above, and click Next.\n\nAfter that, a popup window will appear. Click Proceed.\n\nA confirmation link has been sent to your mailhook. Run the custom mailhook module to see this code in the output under Bundle > Text.\n\nNote\n\nIf you use Gmail for work or school, you don't need to verify the forwarding address.\n\nEnable the forwarding, and save changes.\n\nAdd other desired modules to the scenario. Then save and activate the scenario\n\nNow, every time a new email is received in your email account, the Custom mailhook module in your Make scenario is triggered and receives the email message data.\n\nTip\n\nThe sender and various recipient addresses (To: CC: and BCC:) are resolved in the data structure of the incoming mail. Reply-To: can be found in the Header section.\n\nWebhook rate limit\n\nMake can process up to 30 incoming webhook requests per second.\n\nIf you send more than 30 requests per second, the system returns an error with status code 429.\n\nTroubleshooting Webhooks\nMissing items in the mapping panel\n\nIf some items are missing in the mapping panel in the setup of the modules following the Webhooks > Custom Webhook module, click the Webhooks > Custom Webhook module to open its setup and click Re-determine data structure:\n\nThen follow the steps described in the section Determine the webhook's data structure.\n\nIn this section\nCreating app-specific webhooks\nCreating custom webhooks\nScheduling webhooks processing\nHow Make processes webhooks\nWebhook settings\nError Handling\nSupported incoming data formats\nWebhook headers\nResponding to webhooks\nHTML Response example\nRedirect example\nCustom mailhook\nWebhook rate limit\nTroubleshooting Webhooks\nWebhooks\nCreating app-specific webhooks\nCreating custom webhooks\nInserting webhooks to scenarios\nSetting up webhook data structure\nScheduling webhooks processing\nHow Make processes webhooks\nParallel vs. sequential processing\nProcessing scheduled webhooks\nWebhook queue details\nWebhook settings\nError Handling\nSupported incoming data formats\nQuery String\nForm Data\nMultipart\nJSON\nWebhook headers\nResponding to webhooks\nHTML Response example\nRedirect example\nCustom mailhook\nExample Of Use\nWebhook rate limit\nTroubleshooting Webhooks\nMissing items in the mapping panel\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

The functions available in Make are similar to functions in Excel or those in other programming languages. The functions let you perform various transformations of item values, such as converting a text to uppercase, trimming a text, converting a date into a different format, and many others.\n\nInserting functions into fields\n\nFunctions can be inserted into fields the same way as items. If you click into a field, the mapping panel pops up.\n\nThe mapping panel contains several tabs:\n\nThe first tab (shown upon opening the panel) displays the items that you can map from other modules.\n\nThe other tabs contain various functions:\n\nGeneral functions - see General functions\n\nMath functions - see Math functions\n\nText and binary functions - see String functions\n\nDate and time - see Date & time functions\n\nTokens for date/time formatting\n\nTokens for date/time parsing\n\nFunctions for working with arrays - see Array functions\n\nCustom functions\n\nCustom and system variables\n\nTo insert a function into a field, click the function name or drag it to the field.\n\nExample: shortening a tweet\n\nWhen posting a new tweet with the Twitter > Create a tweet module, you should not exceed Twitter's 280-character limit. Otherwise, the module throws an error. If you map a text item that can contain more than 280 characters into the module's Status field, you can use the substring() function to limit the tweet to 280 characters:\n\nUsing Google Sheets functions\n\nIf you miss a function, but it is featured by Google Sheets, you may use it like this:\n\nIn Google Sheets, create a new empty spreadsheet.\n\nIn Make, open your scenario.\n\nInsert the Google Sheets > Update a cell module.\n\nConfigure the module:\n\nChoose the newly created spreadsheet in the Spreadsheet field.\n\nInsert your formula containing the Google Sheets function(s) into the Value field.\n\nNote that you can use the output of the preceding modules as usual.\n\nInsert the Google Sheets > Get a cell module to obtain the calculated result.\n\nConfigure the module. Fill in the same Cell ID as you filled in step 4.\n\nIn this section\nInserting functions into fields\nExample: shortening a tweet\nUsing Google Sheets functions\nUsing functions\nInserting functions into fields\nExample: shortening a tweet\nUsing Google Sheets functions\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

The search pattern is a regular expression (aka regex or regexp), which is a sequence of characters in which each character is either a metacharacter, having a special meaning, or a regular character that has a literal meaning.\n\nThe complete list of metacharacters can be found on the MDN web docs website.\n\nFor a tutorial on how to create regular expressions, we recommend the RegexOne website.\n\nFor an easy, quick regex generator, try the Regular Expressions generator.\n\nFor experimenting with regular expressions, we recommend the regular expressions 101 website. Just make sure to tick the ECMAScript (JavaScript) FLAVOR in the left panel:\n\nPattern\n\n\t\n\nEnter the regular expression pattern. For example, [+-]?(\\d+(\\.\\d+)?|\\.\\d+)([eE][+-]?\\d+)? extracts all numerals in the provided text.\n\nNote\n\nThe pattern will contain at least one capture group in parenthesis () for the output bundle to contain some items. If the pattern does not contain any capture groups, the output bundle will be empty:\n\n\n\n\nGlobal match\n\n\t\n\nIf enabled, then the module retrieves all matches in the text.

It is possible to configure the module to reset the value:\n\nAfter one cycle\n\nAfter one scenario run\n\nNever\n\nExample\n\nOne of the module's uses is to implement a so-called Round robin assignment of tasks/leads/emails/etc. to users in a group. The algorithm chooses the assignees from a group in some rational order, usually going from the top to the bottom of a list and then starting again at the top of the list and continuing until finished (like you would deal a deck of cards).\n\nThe following scenario sends an email to the first recipient after every odd scenario run, and to the second recipient after every even scenario run.\n\nConfigure the module to never reset the value:\n\nThere are two conditions used after the router module:\n\n1. Odd – set the condition using the modulus math function that equals 1:\n\nDo not forget to change the Equal to operator from the default Text operator to the Numeric operator!\n\n2. Even – set the condition using the modulus math function that equals 0:\n\nSleep\n\nAllows you to delay the scenario flow for up to 300 seconds (5 minutes).\n\nDelay\n\n\t\n\nEnter the number of seconds the scenario will be paused for.\n\nThis function can be useful, for example, if you want to lower the target service server load or to simulate more human behavior when sending bulk SMS or emails.\n\nIf you wish to pause the flow for longer periods of time, we suggest splitting your scenario into two scenarios:\n\nThe first scenario would contain the part before the pause\n\nThe second scenario would contain the part after it\n\nThe first scenario would end up storing all the necessary information in a data store together with the current timestamp. The second scenario would periodically check the Data store for records with a timestamp older than the intended delay, retrieve the records, finalize the processing of the data, and remove the records from the Data store.\n\nSet Variable\n\nCreates a variable that can be mapped by other modules in the route or by the Get Variable module for every route in the scenario.\n\nVariable name\n\n\t\n\nEnter the variable name. This name will be displayed when mapping the variable in other modules.\n\n\n\n\nVariable lifetime\n\n\t\n\nOne cycle\n\nThe variable is valid only for one cycle. Useful when multiple webhooks in one scenario run are received (more webhooks = more cycles).\n\nOne execution\n\nThe variable is valid for one execution. One execution can contain more cycles.\n\n\n\n\nVariable value\n\n\t\n\nEnter the value of the variable.\n\nSet Multiple Variables\n\nCreates multiple variables that can be mapped by other modules in the route or by the Get Multiple Variables module for every route in the scenario within a single operation.\n\nThe main benefits of the Set multiple variables module are:\n\none Set multiple variables module can replace a whole series of Set variable modules\n\none Set multiple variables module consumes just a single operation\n\nVariables\n\n\t\n\nAdd multiple variables you want to set.\n\nVariable name\n\n\t\n\nEnter the variable name. This name will be displayed when mapping the variable in other modules.\n\n\n\n\nVariable value\n\n\t\n\nEnter the value of the variable.\n\n\n\n\nVariable lifetime\n\n\t\n\nOne cycle\n\nThe variable is valid only for one cycle. Useful when multiple webhooks in one scenario run are received (more webhooks = more cycles).\n\nOne execution\n\nThe variable is valid for one execution. One execution can contain more cycles.\n\nPossible uses of the Set/Get (multiple) variable(s) modules:\n\nTo store a calculated value for later use, even in a different route. Especially in cases when the value is used in multiple modules and the formula to calculate the value is overly complex.\n\nTo debug a formula. If a formula used in a module does not seemingly provide a correct result, copy the formula and paste it into a Set Variable module that you insert before the relevant module. Disconnect the module(s) after the Set Variable module and execute the scenario. Verify the Set Variable module's output, adjust/simplify the formula, execute the scenario again, and continue to do so until the issue has been resolved.\n\nGet Variable\n\nRetrieves a value that was previously created by the Set Variable module.\n\nNote that this module can read a variable that was set anywhere in the scenario. The only requirement is that the Tools > Set Variable is executed before (in time) the Tools > Get Variable module. See the documentation for the Router module for information about the order in which routes are processed.\n\nGet Multiple Variables\n\nRetrieves values that were previously created by the Set Multiple Variables module within a single operation.\n\nThe main benefits of the Set multiple variables module are:\n\none Get multiple variables module can replace a whole series of Get variable modules\n\none Get multiple variables module consumes just a single operation\n\nVariables\n\n\t\n\nAdd multiple variables you want to get.\n\nVariable name\n\n\t\n\nMap the variable name of the variable you want to get.\n\nPossible uses of the Set/Get (multiple) variable(s) modules:\n\nTo store a calculated value for later use, even in a different route.

Disconnect the module(s) after the Set Variable module and execute the scenario. Verify the Set Variable module's output, adjust/simplify the formula, execute the scenario again, and continue to do so until the issue has been resolved.\n\nAggregators\nTable Aggregator\n\nMerges values from the selected fields of received bundles into a single bundle using a specified column and row separator (which allows you to create a table).\n\nSource module\n\n\t\n\nSelect the module you want to aggregate fields from.\n\n\n\n\nAggregated fields\n\n\t\n\nSelect the fields from the module selected above whose values you want to aggregate into one bundle.\n\n\n\n\nColumn separator\n\n\t\n\nSelect or enter the type of separator that will separate the field value columns in the resulting bundle.\n\n\n\n\nRow separator\n\n\t\n\nSelect or enter the type of separator that will separate the field value rows in the resulting bundle.\n\n\n\n\nGroup by\n\n\t\n\nDefine an expression containing one or more mapped items. The aggregated data will then be separated into Groups with the same expression's value. Each Group outputs a separate bundle containing a Key with the evaluated expression and the aggregated text. By doing this, you can use the Key as a filter in subsequent modules.\n\nText Aggregator\n\nMerges values from the selected fields of received bundles into a single bundle.\n\nExample\n\nYou can use the text aggregator tool to insert more values (e.g. customer names or notes) into a single bundle and send an email containing all the values in the email body or the email subject.\n\nNumeric Aggregator\n\nThis module allows you to retrieve numerical values, then apply one of the selected functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX,...), and return the result in one bundle.\n\nExample\n\nThe module sums up values under the number parameter.\n\nTransformers\nCompose a String\n\nConverts any value to a string data type (text). It makes the mapping easier when mapping e.g. binary data.\n\nConvert the Encoding of the Text\n\nConverts entered input text (or binary data) to the selected encoding.\n\nInput data\n\n\t\n\nEnter the content you want to convert.\n\n\n\n\nInput data codepage\n\n\t\n\nEnter the input data encoding type. This is important for the binary form of data.\n\n\n\n\nOutput data codepage\n\n\t\n\nSelect the target encoding of your data.\n\nSwitch\n\nChecks the input value for a match with the provided list of values. Returns output based on the result.\n\nInput\n\n\t\n\nEnter the expression you want to evaluate.\n\n\n\n\nCases\n\n\t\n\nIf the input contains a value entered to the Pattern field, then the value entered to the Output field is returned. If the condition is not met, then no output is returned OR the value from the Else field (below) is returned.\n\n\n\n\nElse\n\n\t\n\nEnter the value that is returned when the criteria set in the Cases field are not met.\n\nExecute a Scenario\n\nStatus: PLANNED - see the Workaround section below.\n\nWorkaround\n\nEmploy the HTTP > Make a request module in the main scenario to call the other scenario.

The fields in this module depends on your data structure.\n\nThe data structure describes how the JSON data is organized and enables mapping individual JSON items to other modules in your scenario.\n\nSelect the data structure, and enter the field details to create JSON. The data provided in the module returns in the JSON format in the output.\n\nConvert JSON to XML\n\nConverts the given JSON data to XML format.\n\nParse JSON\nData structure\n\nThe data structure describes how the JSON data is organized and enables mapping individual JSON items to other modules in your scenario. If you don't provide the Data structure, you may manually execute the module and Make will build the structure from the provided JSON:\n\nFill the JSON String field in the Parse JSON module.\n\nDo not yet connect the other following modules. Because Makedoes not know the structure of the JSON data, it will not be possible to map data from the Parse JSON module to other modules in your scenario.\n\nManually run the scenario. The Parse JSON module will identify the JSON structure from your provided JSON.\n\nYou can now connect the following modules. The items from the Parse JSON module will now be available for mapping.\n\nCollection vs. Array\n\nJSON string field can contain a collection\n\n{ ... }\n\n{ \"name\" : \"Peter\", \"ID\" : 1}\n\nIn which case, the output will be a single bundle containing the items of the collection:\n\nOr it can contain an array.\n\n[ ... ]\n\n:\n\n[ { \"name\" : \"Peter\", \"ID\" : 1 }, { \"name\" : \"Mike\", \"ID\" : 2 }]\n\nIn which case the output will be a series of bundles, each bundle containing one array's item:\n\nTransforming data records to JSON\n\nLet us assume that the data records you wish to transform to JSON format reside in a Google spreadsheet. Here is the procedure on how to transform the data records to JSON format described in ten steps:\n\nPlace the Google Sheets > Select rows module in your scenario to fetch the data. Set up the module to retrieve rows from your Google spreadsheet and set the Maximum number of returned rows to a small number but larger than one for testing purposes (e.g., three). Execute the Google Sheets module (right-click it and choose \"Run this module only\") and verify its output.\n\nConnect the Array Aggregator module after the Google Sheets module. In the module's setup, choose the Google Sheets module in the Source node field. Leave the other fields as they are for the moment.\n\nConnect JSON > Create JSON module after the Array Aggregator module. The module's setup requires a data structure that describes the JSON format. Click the Add button to open the Data structure setup. The easiest way to create this Data structure is to generate it automatically from a JSON sample. Click the Generator button and paste your JSON sample to the Sample data field:\n\n{ \"books\": [ { \"id\": \"ID\", \"title\": \"Title\", \"author\": \"Author\" } ]}\n\nClick Save. The Specification field in the Data structure setup should now contain the generated structure.\n\nChange the name of your Data structure to something more specific (e.g., \"Books\") and click Save. If everything goes well, a field corresponding to the root array attribute should appear mappable in the JSON module's setup.\n\nClick the Map button next to the field and map the\n\nArray[]\n\nitem outputted from the Array aggregator module to it:\n\nClick OK to close the JSON module's setup.\n\nOpen the setup of the Array Aggregator module. Change the Target structure from Custom to the JSON module's field corresponding to the root array attribute. Map items outputted from the Google Sheets module to the appropriate fields:\n\nClick OK to close the Array Aggregator module's setup.\n\nRun the scenario. If everything goes well, the JSON module should output the correct JSON format. Open the setup of the Google Sheets module and increase the Maximum number of returned rows number to be larger than the number of rows in your spreadsheet to process all the data. The resulting JSON can then be used as a body of an HTTP request, returned as a Webhook's response, etc.\n\nSimulating module output using Parse JSON\n\nMake allows you to mock the data from the existing module and perform testing for your scenario. You can execute this operation using the Parse JSON tool from the Apps section.\n\nExecute the module whose output data you want to mock using the Parse JSON.\n\nClick the resulting output above the module.\n\nClick Download output bundles from the dropdown menu.\n\nA window containing the original module's output bundles in JSON format pops up.\n\nCopy the window's content and click Close.\n\nInsert the Tools > Parse JSON module after the original module, open its configuration, and paste the copied JSON data in Step 4 into the JSON string field.\n\nUnlink the original module from the scenario.\n\nDo not delete the original module.\n\nExecute the mock-up JSON module and use its output instead of the original module's output in your scenario.\n\nBuild and test your scenario.\n\nOnce you are done with the testing, change the mapping from the mock-up module to the original module across the whole scenario with the DevTool's Remap Source tool.\n\nPut back the original module before the mock-up JSON module and remove the JSON module.\n\nIn the Remap Source section, it is not necessary to fill the Module to Edit field unless you do not want to remap all values from the original module in the whole scenario.\n\nAggregate to JSON\n\nConverts the multiple output bundles to a single bundle.\n\nYou need to attach this aggregator module to the source module whose output you want to convert to a single module; for example, the Parse JSON modules give the output in multiple bundles.\n\nAfter selecting the source module, select the data structure, and the remaining fields are populated from the source module.\n\nSave the scenario and execute it. You can see the output is only one bundle.\n\nTroubleshooting JSON\n\nCannot map data from the Parse JSON module\n\nEnsure the JSON content is properly mapped into the Parse JSON module and the data structure is correctly defined. See the above section, JSON processing, for more details.\n\nIn this section\nCreate JSON\nConvert JSON to XML\nParse JSON\nTransforming data records to JSON\nSimulating module output using Parse JSON\nAggregate to JSON\nTroubleshooting JSON\nJSON\nCreate JSON\nConvert JSON to XML\nParse JSON\nCollection vs. Array\nTransforming data records to JSON\nSimulating module output using Parse JSON\nAggregate to JSON\nTroubleshooting JSON\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

If the result value type is Buffer (binary data) then use toString() function to convert it to the Text type.\n\nExample of parsing an XML\n\nA typical use case is to download an XML file from a URL and parse its content. Here is a step by step guide how to achieve this:\n\nCreate a new scenario\n\nInsert HTTP > Get a file module\n\nOpen the module's configuration and configure it as follows:\n\nURL\n\n\t\n\nURL of the XML file (e.g.https://siftrss.com/f/rqLy05ayMBJ)\n\nClose the module's configuration.\n\nAdd XML > Parse XML module, connect it after the HTTP > Get a file module and configure it as follows:\n\nData structure\n\n\t\n\nClick on Add.\n\nClick on Generator\n\nIn your web browser, open a new tab/window.\n\nPut the URL you used in the third step in the address bar and fetch the XML file.\n\nSelect all the XML text and copy it into the clipboard.\n\nClose the tab/window and get back to your scenario\n\nPaste the copied XML text into the Sample data field.\n\nClick on Save.\n\nVerify that the Data structure has been successfully generated.\n\nClick on Save to save the Data structure.\n\nNote\n\nYou may skip the steps 2-9 to supply an empty data structure.

Use the toString() function to convert its value from Buffer (binary data) type to Text type.\n\nYou may copy and paste the formula's code into the field: {{toString(1.data)}}\n\nParsing XML attributes\n\nBy default, the  XML > Parse XML module will put attributes in a special collection _attributes as a child of the node, that has these attributes. If the node is a text node and it has attributes, then two special properties will be added: _attributes for attributes and _value for the text content of the node.\n\nExample\n\nThis XML:\n\n<root attr=\"1\">\n    <node attr=\"ABC\">Hello, World</node>\n</root>\n\nwill be converted into this bundle:\n\nCreating XML\n\nThe XML > Create XML module converts a bundle to an XML formatted text.\n\nData structure\n\n\t\n\nThe Data structure describes the structure of the resulting XML.

If everything goes well, the XML module should output the correct XML file. Open the setup of the Google Sheets module and increase the Maximum number of returned rows number to be larger than the number of rows in your spreadsheet to process all the data. The resulting XML can be then saved to Dropbox, sent as an attachment via email, uploaded via FTP to a server, etc.\n\nAdding XML attributes\n\nIf you want to add attributes to a complex node (a node, that will contain other nodes), you have to add a collection with the name _attributes for this node in your custom Data structure, and this collection will be mapped to node attributes\n\nIf you want to add attributes to a text node (example: <node attr=\"1\">abc</node>), you have to add a collection _attributes for attributes and a text property _value for the node value for this node in your custom Data structure.\n\nExample\n{\n    \"name\": \"node\",\n    \"type\": \"collection\",\n    \"spec\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"_attributes\",\n            \"type\": \"collection\"\n            \"spec\": [\n                 {\n                     \"name\": \"attr1\",\n                     \"type\": \"text\"\n                 }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"_value\",\n            \"type\": \"text\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\nTroubleshooting XML\nCannot map data from the Parse XML module\n\nMake sure the Data structure is defined correctly.

You can use data stores to store data from apps during scenario execution. Data stores are similar to a simple database.\n\nThe data store app's modules allow you to add, replace, update, retrieve, delete, search, or count records in your Make data store.\n\nYou can view and manage your data stores and the data they contain in the data stores section of Make.\n\nNote\n\nThe various examples of use can be found here.\n\nCreating a data store in Make\n\nClick Data stores in the left menu.\n\nClick Add data store.\n\nEnter settings for the new data store.\n\nData store name\n\n\t\n\nEnter the name for the data store. E.g. Contacts\n\n\n\n\nData Structure\n\n\t\n\nA data structure is a list of the columns for a table that indicates the column name and data type.\n\nYou have three options:\n\nSelect the data structure that has been already created\n\nLeave the field empty\n\nIf you don't select a data structure, the database will only contain the primary key. Such a database type is useful if you only want to save keys and are only interested in knowing whether or not a specific key exists in the database.\n\nAdd a new data structure\n\nClick the Add button to create a new data structure.\n\nPlease see the Setting Up the Data Structure section of this article.\n\n\n\n\nData storage size in MB\n\n\t\n\nAllocate the size for the data store from your total Internal data storage.\n\nNote\n\nThe reserved amount can be changed at any time later on.\n\nThe total internal data storage capacity depends on the plan you have purchased.\n\nManaging data structure of a data store\nSetting up the data structure\n\nTo set up the data structure, open the Add data structure window.\n\nYou can access this dialog by clicking the Add button when creating or editing the data store:\n\nData structure name\n\n\t\n\nEnter the name for the data structure.\n\nThe data structure name is its unique identifier and cannot be changed later.\n\n\n\n\nSpecification\n\n\t\n\nThere are two options for how you can specify the data store columns.\n\nClick the Add item button to specify the properties of one column manually.\n\nEnter the Name and Type for the data store column and define the corresponding properties.\n\nNote\n\nEnabling the Advanced settings reveals the Label setting for every data structure item.\n\nConsider defining a label for every item in the data structure of your data store in order to avoid challenges when renaming data store columns.\n\nUse the Generator button to determine the columns from the sample data you provide.\n\nFor example, the following JSON sample data:\n\n{\n\n \"name\":\"John\",\n\n \"age\":30,\n\n \"phone number\": {\n\n \"mobile\":\"987654321\",\n\n \"landline\":\"123456789\"\n\n }\n\n }\n\ncreates three columns (name, age, phone number) with phone number as a collection of mobile and landline.\n\nThe empty columns in the data store view:\n\nYou can then add values to the data store manually or using the Make data store modules.\n\n\n\n\nStrict\n\n\t\n\nIf enabled, the data structure will be compared to the structure of the payload and if the payload contains extra items not specified in the data structure, the payload will be rejected.\n\nUpdating the data structure of a data store\nImportant\n\nTake good care when updating the data structure of a data store. Before updating the structure make a backup of the data in the data store.\n\nChanges in the data structure of a data store might lead to unexpected results. If you experience unexpected behavior check out the Troubleshooting section.\n\nWhen you want to update the data structure of a data store, you should keep in mind that:\n\nThe data structure field names are unique identifiers of the data store columns. When you rename a field of a data structure, Make cannot retrieve the original data in the data store column, because they use a different column identifier.\n\nYou can update the data structure field label anytime without the effects mentioned in the previous point.\n\nThe changes to the data store structure apply only to the new data you put in the data store. Make doesn't change or validate the original data to fit the updated structure.\n\nThe best approach to updating the data structure of a data store is to create temporary fields with copies of your data. Update the data in the temporary fields and make sure they conform to the final data structure.\n\nExample data store:\n\nIn the data store with 4 columns:\n\nKey: type number\n\nproductId: type number\n\nproductName: type text\n\ndateAdded: type date\n\nRenaming a field of the data store structure\n\nYou can update the Label of a data store structure field anytime.\n\nIf you want to change the data store structure field Name, follow the steps:\n\nCreate a backup of data in the data store.\n\nCreate a field in your data store with the new name.\n\nCopy all data from the original column to the new column.\n\nUpdate all data in the original column to empty fields. This step prevents storing the data in the original column alongside the data in the new column.\n\nYou have put the data from the original data store column into the new data store column. In addition, you have a data store backup to check that the update was successful.\n\nChanging the type of a field of the data store structure\n\nCreate a backup of data in the data store.\n\nEither create a temporary field for the updated data type, or you can skip this step and update the field type in place.\n\nUse a conversion function to update the type of all values in the data store column to the new type. For example, to convert text to date, use the parseDate function.\n\nYou have updated the type of the data store column. You have converted all data in the data store column to the new data type.\n\nActions\nAdd/Replace a Record\nUpdate a Record\nGet a Record\nCheck the Existence Of a Record\nDelete a Record\nDelete All Records\nSearch Records\nCount Records\nManaging records in data stores\n\nMake allows you to view, update, and delete the records in your data store.\n\nTo manage records in your data store, click Data stores in the left menu, then click Browse next to your data store.\n\nThis shows the editing interface for data store records.\n\nAdding and editing records\nDeleting records\nBacking up data in the data store\nTroubleshooting\nRestoring lost data from your data store\nUpdating data store structure\nOut of space error\n\nIn this section\nCreating a data store in Make\nManaging data structure of a data store\nActions\nManaging records in data stores\nTroubleshooting\nData store\nCreating a data store in Make\nManaging data structure of a data store\nSetting up the data structure\nUpdating the data structure of a data store\nActions\nAdd/Replace a Record\nUpdate a Record\nGet a Record\nCheck the Existence Of a Record\nDelete a Record\nDelete All Records\nSearch Records\nCount Records\nManaging records in data stores\nAdding and editing records\nDeleting records\nBacking up data in the data store\nTroubleshooting\nRestoring lost data from your data store\nUpdating data store structure\nOut of space error\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

These modules can either return an output file to be sent for further processing or require a file to be passed to them for processing. For these modules to work together to process files they have to be mapped to each other.\n\nHow to map a file\n\nModules that have the ability to work with files require two pieces of information:\n\nFile name\n\nFile content (data)\n\nWhen you map a file, you choose from which module(s) in your scenario you want to obtain the data from. The file name and file content are then automatically mapped as they are.\n\nNote\n\nIf you need to process a file from a URL, we recommend to use the HTTP > Get a File module to download the file from the URL, and then map the file from the HTTP > Get a File module to the desired module's field in your scenario.\n\nExample: Mapping Facebook photos to Dropbox\n\nThe example below shows how to map photos (files) from Facebook to Dropbox. The facebook trigger Watch photos returns detailed information about each downloaded photo, including its name and content (data). To map this information to Dropbox so it can be uploaded, the Dropbox action Upload a file requires you to specify the source file that this information will be mapped from. By selecting the Facebook > Watch photos option under the source file, Make will automatically map the file name and file content. From now on, all photos from Facebook will be uploaded to the specified Dropbox folder.\n\nHowever, it can happen that you want to rename the file, but want to keep the data as it is. In such case, use the Map option (as seen in the image below) to map the file name and file content independently of each other.\n\nYou will have to enter the full file name, including the ending (e.g. invoice.xml). Both binary (photos, videos, PDF and the like) and text formats are supported.\n\nMaximum file size\n\nThe maximum file size depends on the plan you are subscribed to (FREE - 5 MB, CORE - 100 MB, PRO - 250 MB, TEAMS - 500 MB, ENTERPRISE - 1,000 MB). If it is exceeded, Make proceeds in accordance with the settings of the Enable data loss option.\n\nIn this section\nHow to map a file\nMaximum file size\nWorking with files\nHow to map a file\nExample: Mapping Facebook photos to Dropbox\nMaximum file size\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

A simple array contains one or more text values. A complex array contains one or more collections of the same type. An example of a complex array is the email attachment. The Watch emails module returns an array of attachments for every email. Every attachment represents a collection that may contain a name, content, size, etc.\n\nMapping an array's first element\n\nIf you map the array's Recipient name item, it will appear in the field like this:\n\nThe number between the square brackets is an index that determines which element of the array will be used. Leaving it empty defaults to the first element.\n\nMapping an array's nth element\n\nIf you wish to access another element, enter or map a value between the square brackets. In the below example, enter 2 to select the second element.\n\nMapping an array's element with a given key\n\nSome arrays contain several collections with key and value items. These are typically various metadata, attributes, etc.\n\nThe following example shows the output of the WooCommerce > Get a product module that contains the item Meta data, which is an array of collections. Each collection contains the key item Meta Data ID and the value item Value:\n\nThe typical requirement is to lookup an element by its given key value and to obtain the corresponding value from the value item. This can be achieved with a formula employing a combination of themap ()andget ()functions.\n\nThe following example shows how to obtain the value of the Value item of the element with key Meta data ID item value equal to 20642\n\nThe result of the formula will be \"no\".\n\nThe detailed breakdown of the formula follows:\n\nThe 1st parameter of the map() function is the whole array item.\n\nThe 2nd parameter is the raw name of the value item. To obtain the raw name, hover the mouse cursor over the item in the mapping panel:\n\nImportant\n\nAll parameters are case sensitive. Even though in this particular example the item's label differs from its raw name only in capitalization, it is necessary to use the raw name, which is all lowercase value in contrast to the label Value\n\nThe 3rd parameter is the raw name of the key item:\n\nThe 4th parameter is the given key value.\n\nBecause the map() function returns an array (as there could be more elements with the given key value), it is necessary to apply the get() function to get its first element:\n\nThe 1st parameter of the get() function is the result of the map() function.\n\nThe 2nd parameter is the element's index - one.\n\nSee also our Extract an item and/or its value from an array of collections video tutorial.\n\nConverting elements to a series of bundles\n\nArrays can be converted to a series of bundles using the Iterator module:\n\nImportant\n\nThe outputs from modules wrapped between an Iterator and Aggregator are not accessible beyond the Aggregator module.\n\nIn this section\nMapping an array's first element\nMapping an array's nth element\nMapping an array's element with a given key\nConverting elements to a series of bundles\nMapping arrays\nMapping an array's first element\nMapping an array's nth element\nMapping an array's element with a given key\nConverting elements to a series of bundles\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Each array item will output as a separate bundle.\n\nSetting up an iterator\n\nSetting up an iterator is done in the same way as setting any other module. The Array field contains the array to be converted/split into separate bundles.\n\nExamples:\nSave email attachments to Google Drive\n\nThe scenario below shows how to retrieve emails with attachments and save the attachments as single files in a selected Google Drive folder.\n\nEmails can contain an array of attachments. The Iterator module inserted after the first module enables you to handle each attachment separately. The Iterator splits the array of attachments into single bundles, each bundle with one attachment will then save one at a time in a selected Google Drive folder. The Iterator module set up is shown above - the Array field should contain the Attachments[] array.\n\nSpecialized iterators\n\nFor your convenience, many Make apps offer specialized iterator modules with a simplified setup. For example, the Email app contains the special iterator Email > Iterate attachments that will produce the same results as the general Iterator without having to specify the array, just the source module.\n\nLearn when to use an Iterator in your scenarios\n\nThe video below is module 1 of the 3 part lesson titled Iterator and Array Aggregator. It explains the purpose of the Iterator and the Array Aggregator and with the help of a sample scenario, explains when to use an Iterator and what to do with the output.\n\nTroubleshooting: Mapping panel does not display mappable items under the Iterator module\n\nWhen an Iterator does not have information about the structure of the array's items, the mapping panel in the modules following the Iterator will display only two items under the Iterator: Total number of bundles and Bundle order position:\n\nThe reason for this is that in Make each module is responsible for providing information about items it outputs so these items can be properly displayed in the mapping panel in the following modules. However, there are several modules that might be unable to provide this information in some cases, e.g. JSON > Parse JSON or Webhooks > Custom Webhook modules with missing data structure.\n\nThe solution is to manually execute the scenario to make the module learn about the items it outputs so it can provide the information to the following modules.\n\nFor example, if you have a JSON > Parse JSON module without a data structure as below:\n\nAnd then if you connect an Iterator module to it, you will not be able to map the output of the module to the Array field in the setup panel of the Iterator:\n\nTo resolve this, just manually start the scenario in the Scenario editor. You can un-link the modules after the JSON > Parse JSON module to prevent the flow from proceeding further or right-click the JSON > Parse JSON module and choose \"Run this module only\" from the context menu to execute only the JSON > Parse JSON module.\n\nOnce the JSON > Parse JSON has been executed, it learns about the items it outputs and provides this information to all the following modules including the Iterator. The mapping panel in the Iterator's setup will then display the items:\n\nMoreover, the mapping panel in the modules connected after the Iterator will display the items contained in the array's items:\n\nIn summary: if you cannot see some items in a module's mapping panel, simply run the scenario once so all the modules can learn about the items they output and provide this information to the following modules.\n\nIn this section\nSetting up an iterator\nLearn when to use an Iterator in your scenarios\nIterator\nSetting up an iterator\nExamples:\nLearn when to use an Iterator in your scenarios\nTroubleshooting: Mapping panel does not display mappable items under the Iterator module\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

You can use mapping to tell Make how to transform data in your scenario. For example:\n\nYou want to automatically send information from emails to a colleague in a Slack message. In this case, map the subject or body of email messages to Slack.\n\nWhen a customer submits a form to request support, you want a Jira issue created automatically. Here, you can map the information from the form into Jira.\n\nYour business gets valuable leads from Facebook, so you want a database of this information and the same information entered into Pipedrive. Just map the data from Facebook leads to Airtable and Pipedrive.\n\nIn the same way that a map leads you from your starting point to your destination, mapping in Make tells your data where to go in your scenario.\n\nWhat can I map?\n\nYou can map any information that a module gets in a bundle. A bundle is like a box of information. Some boxes are large; some are small; some have just one thing inside them; some might have smaller boxes in them. Bundles are similar. Sometimes a bundle is just one piece of information, for example, a number or email address. Other times a bundle contains a variety of information.\n\nWhen bundles have a lot of information, you might see the data organized into an array or collection. An array is like a menu organized into different sections like soups, starters, desserts, and so on. There's a lot of information but it's the same kind of information: food. An array has information of only one kind. For example, it might have multiple dates or names but not both. Collections can have different kinds of information and are like a moving box. When you move, you might put various things into one box: books, small gadgets, a box of letters. Collections contain a similar variety of information, for example, dates, numbers, and text descriptions.\n\nGetting a bundle\n\nTo know what you can map from a module, you run only that module and look at its bundles. Once you know what you can map, you can start mapping. Let's use the first example above to explore how this works. We want to take information from emails and send them to a colleague. Before we do any mapping, we begin by finding what information we can get from the email module. Because the email module provides the information we want, we call it the source module.\n\nGo to the Scenario editor and add the module Email > Watch emails.\n\nCreate a connection.\n\nSelect a folder and criteria.\n\nClick OK.\n\nChoose where you want Make to start getting your emails and click OK.\n\nRight-click the module.\n\nSelect Run this module only.\n\nA small circle with 1 inside appears beside your module. Click inside the small circle.\n\nA window opens and shows you all of the information that your email module got. You can map anything that appears. Click + to expand items.\n\nWhat's in a bundle?\n\nLet's take a closer look at the information in the bundle window. In this example, we see the bundles from the Slack > Create a message module.\n\nInput - the information Make sends to the third-party app.\n\nIn this example, you can see:\n\nText - the content of the message sent. Click + to expand for further details.\n\nUser - the user ID of the person receiving your Slack message.\n\nOutput - the information Make gets back from the third-party app.\n\nIn this example, you can see:\n\nMessage - the text content of the sent message, similar to Text in the Input. Click + to expand for further details.\n\nChannel - the ID of the channel where the message was sent. In this case, it's the same as User from the input. That's because we sent a direct message to a specific user.\n\nMapping to the target\n\nNow we know what information we can send to other modules. Next, we map that information. To do that, we first add the module we want to receive the information. In our example, that's Slack > Create a message. If you're still in the Scenario editor, continue with these steps:\n\nAdd the module Slack > Create a message.\n\nCreate a connection.\n\nUnder Enter a channel ID or name, select Choose from a list.\n\nUnder Channel type, select IM channel.\n\nUnder User search or scroll to find your intended recipient.\n\nUnder Text, click inside the empty field. A new window appears.\n\nIn the new window, click Text content. A red box labeled Text content appears in the Text field.\n\nClick OK.\n\nYour data is now mapped so that Slack automatically receives email content and sends it in a message.\n\nTips and solutions\nFind the source module\n\nWhile mapping a scenario, you can find the source module by hovering over the mapped data. As you keep your mouse on a mapped item, the source module pulses.\n\nWhen there's no info for an instant trigger\n\nWhen you click Run once or Run this module only, an instant trigger waits to receive information. The instant trigger needs incoming info to run. So the trigger waits until it receives incoming data. To run the module, you need to provide incoming information. Let's explore with an example: Airtable > Watch responses.\n\nRight-click on Airtable > Watch responses and select Run this module only. The module waits for new responses.\n\nGo to your Airtable form and submit a response.\n\nThe information submitted goes to your Airtable > Watch responses module. You can inspect the bundle to check that your configuration is working.\n\nWhen there's no info for a polling trigger\n\nYou can use the above procedure to generate a bundle for most modules, including polling triggers. For instant modules, see the solution for instant triggers. The following are the general steps to get a bundle.\n\nGo to the Scenario editor and find the module you want to get a bundle for.\n\nRight-click the module.\n\nSelect Choose where to start.\n\nTo get a bundle, select one of the following options and click OK.\n\nFrom a specific date option: for example Emails from after a specific date. Enter a date you know there is data for. Example: enter a date you know you received emails.\n\nSelect the first option: when available, this option lets you choose from a list.\n\nRight-click the module.\n\nSelect Run this module only.\n\nA small circle with 1 inside appears beside your module. Click inside the small circle.\n\nIn this section\nWhat is mapping?\nWhat can I map?\nMapping to the target\nTips and solutions\nMapping\nWhat is mapping?\nWhat can I map?\nGetting a bundle\nWhat's in a bundle?\nMapping to the target\nTips and solutions\nFind the source module\nWhen there's no info for an instant trigger\nWhen there's no info for a polling trigger\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

The type of item may differ. Make describes the different types of items below.\n\nTip\n\nDetailed information on which types of items Make allows for conversion between one other can be found in the Type coercion article.\n\nText\n\nAlso called string, text data contains characters such as letters, numbers, and special characters. Make validates text to make it meets any length requirements.\n\nNumber\n\nFor some numerical items, Make may validate the input for a specified range (the minimum or maximum allowed value).\n\nBoolean (Yes/No)\n\nThis type is used for items with only two possible values: true or false. An example is the Watch also subfolders option shown in the Dropbox > Watch files module.\n\nDate\n\nThe date is entered in the ISO 8601 date format, e.g. 2015-09-18T11:58Z\n\nThe time zone can be adjusted in the profile settings. If you fill in a field that requires entering a date, the pop-up calendar will be displayed in the module settings. The time is not required for some items.\n\nHow Make displays date values\n\nValues of Date items in bundle inspector are formatted using the locale and Web's timezone specified in your Profile in the Web section of the Time zone options tab.\n\nIt is possible to display a date item's value expressed according to ISO 8601 by hovering mouse cursor over the item.\n\nNote\n\nIf the ISO value does not show up, the item is not a date but probably text.\n\nTime\n\nThe time is entered in the hours:minutes:seconds format, e.g. 14:03:52\n\nBuffer (binary data)\n\nFile content is usually sent as Buffer type (image content, video file and others). In some cases, there is text data included in this type (e.g. text file). Make is able to automatically convert text data in binary code to text (and vice versa). For more information on working with files see the Working with files article.\n\nCollection\n\nA collection is an item consisting of several subitems. An example of a collection is the Sender item in an email message. It contains the sender name (text type) and the sender email address (text type).\n\nArray\n\nThe array type is used for working with several values of the same type, including collections. An example is the Email modules return an array of attachments and each attachment contains name, content, size, etc.\n\nFor more information about arrays please see the Working with arrays section.\n\nValidation\n\nMake may perform validation on each type of item. If an item does not pass the validation, the processing of the module will terminate because of the DataError. The Twitter modules, for example, do not allow a tweet (text type) that exceeds the maximum of 280 characters to be sent. If you try to send a tweet with more than 280 characters, your scenario will encounter this error and end.\n\nIn this section\nText\nNumber\nBoolean (Yes/No)\nDate\nTime\nBuffer (binary data)\nCollection\nArray\nValidation\nItem data types\nText\nNumber\nBoolean (Yes/No)\nDate\nHow Make displays date values\nTime\nBuffer (binary data)\nCollection\nArray\nValidation\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

At the moment, it is just a concept that provides a counterpart to the Router module, allowing you to reduce duplication of modules in different routes.\n\nSolution\n\nTo implement the Converger concept, use one of the following workarounds to avoid the duplication of the common sequence.\n\nData store\n\nAdd an extra filter-free route to the Router to connect the common sequence (the one you would put after a Converger module).\n\nAdd Data store > Add/replace a record modules at the end of each Router's route (except the new extra route) to store the data outputted by the modules on the route that should be passed to the common sequence. The Data store would contain just one record, the record's key can be e.g. \"MyKey\".\n\nAdd Data store > Get a record module at the beginning of the common sequence to obtain the previously stored data.\n\nJSON\n\nIf you wish to avoid the use of the Data store you can:\n\nInstead of the Data store > Get a record module use JSON > Create JSON module followed by Tools > Set variable to store the resulting JSON in a variable (e.g. \"MyBundle\").\n\nInstead of the Data store > Get a record module use Tools > Get variable to obtain the previously stored variable followed by JSON > Parse JSON.\n\nPlease note that if no route is executed, the JSON > Parse JSON will throw the following error:\n\nTo avoid this, you may employ the ifemtpy() function as show below:\n\nSet a variable\n\nIf it is just a single value that you need to pass to the common sequence (e.g. ID), you can employ only the Tools > Set variable and Get variable modules.\n\nMake also allows you to use the Set multiple variables module.\n\nA separate new scenario\n\nYou may also place the common sequence to a separate new scenario and then:\n\nEmploy HTTP > Make a request module at the end of each route to pass the data to the new scenario.\n\nEmploy Webhooks > Custom webhook module at the beginning of the new scenario to receive the data.\n\nIn this section\nSolution\nConverger\nSolution\nData store\nJSON\nSet a variable\nA separate new scenario\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

The use case for this is that should you ever need to match or pass data through a filter only the second matched value you can specify which value that is represented by the numerical value.\n\nTo be able to get the match values that you require to add brackets to the part that you wish to parse for example if one wishes to extract from \"filename.docx\" - \"docx\" only then according to the regex expression we are using for this case scenario the brackets should be applied on \\.(.+) this will capture the docx place it in a group and leave the \".\" out of it.\n\nThe output shown in the picture below, you will notice that the capturing group will match any character (except for line terminators).\n\nAnother workaround thats also incorporates regex is using the replace function:\n\n{{replace(\"abcdefghijklmno pqr stuvw xyz.docx\"; \"/.*\\./\"; \".\")}}\n\nThen replace abcdefghijklmno pqr stuvw xyz.docx with your actual filename variable.\n\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

The content of the array's items depends on particular aggregator module and its setup.\n\nA typical example of an aggregator module is the Array aggregator module. Aggregators usually feature the following fields:\n\nSource Module\n\n\t\n\nThe module from which the bundle aggregation will start. The source module is usually an iterator or a search module that outputs a series of bundles. Once you setup the aggregator's Source Module (and close the aggregator's setup), the route between the source module and the aggregator will be wrapped in a grey area to visualize the start and the end of the aggregation.\n\n\n\n\nGroup by\n\n\t\n\nThe aggregator's output can be split into several groups with the help of the Group by field. The Group by field can contain a formula that is evaluated for each aggregator's input bundle. The aggregator then outputs one bundle per each distinct formula's value. Each bundle contains two items:\n\nKey contains the distinct value.\n\nArray contains the aggregated data from the bundles for which the formula evaluated to the Key value.\n\n\n\n\nStop processing after an empty aggregation\n\n\t\n\nBy default, the aggregator outputs the result of the aggregation even in case no bundles reached the aggregator (e.g. because they have been all filtered out on their way). If the Stop processing after an empty aggregation option is enabled, the aggregator will not produce any output bundle in this case and the flow will stop.\n\nNote\n\nBundles outputted from the source module and any other modules between the source module and the aggregator module are not outputted by the aggregator and thus items in these bundles are not accessible by the modules in the flow after the aggregator.\n\nIf you need to access items from bundles outputted from the source module and any other modules between the source module and the aggregator module, make sure to include them in the aggregator's setup, e.g. in the Aggregated fields field in the setup of the Array aggregator module.\n\nExample\nUse case: Zipping all email attachments and uploading the ZIP file to Dropbox\n\nThe scenario below shows how to:\n\nWatch a mailbox for incoming emails: Email > Watch emails trigger will output a bundle with item Attachments[] , which is an array containing all the email's attachments.\n\nIterate the email's attachments: Email > Iterate attachments iterator takes the items from the Attachments[] array one by one and sends them further as separate bundles.\n\nAggregate the bundles outputted by the Email > Iterate attachments module: Archive > Create an archive aggregator accumulates all the bundles it receives and outputs a single bundle containing the ZIP file\n\nUpload the resulting ZIP file to Dropbox: Dropbox > Upload a file obtains the ZIP file from the Archive > Create an archive module and uploads it to Dropbox.\n\nBelow is a sample setup of the Archive > Create an archive aggregator:\n\nIn this section\nExample\nAggregator\nExample\nUse case: Zipping all email attachments and uploading the ZIP file to Dropbox\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

This is what you need when you want to start a Bubble workflow when an action such as clicking a button takes place on a page in your Bubble app.\n\nYou may watch the video tutorial or continue reading below:\n\nInstall the API Connector plugin in your Bubble application and define an API call to send data to Make webhook.\n\nLet's call this endpoint 'SendToMake' and under authentication, select None or self-handled as shown below:\n\nNext, add an API call to POST an ACTION to the Webhook URL which will be obtained from Make in the next step.\n\nMake sure you add the parameters type and message to the call.\n\nCreate a scenario with the Watch events module by Bubble as the trigger.\n\nHere, add a new webhook, copy the URL and paste it in the API Call plugin shown in the previous step.\n\nCreate a button to start a workflow on Bubble\n\nWe will use the same form used in the Create a Data Thing or a Bulk of Data Things on Bubble. Check it out if you haven't already.\n\nThe form looks like the one below and the Submit button starts the workflow:\n\nAdd an action to the workflow which starts when the button is clicked.\n\nThis workflow needs to have an action to make the API Call created in the first step. Since the API Call was used to post an Action, it will be visible under Plugins as shown below:\n\nAfter selecting the API Call, the body has to be added as a JSON in the message field as shown:\n\nHere, we pass the values of fname and email which refer to the fields on the form. You can add all the required parameters here. The JSON body is as below:\n\n{ \"fname\" : \"fname's value\",\n\n\"email\" : \"email's value\"\n\n}\n\nComplete the scenario and run it.\n\nThe final step in this tutorial is to add the rest of the modules to your scenario and run it. Since the data is sent as a JSON from the Bubble Workflow, it's recommended to use a Parse JSON module unless you are using a service that accepts JSON directly.\n\nTo trigger the scenario, you need to start the Bubble workflow by clicking on the submit button in the preview mode on Bubble.\n\nIn the scenario above, the JSON is parsed to extract the fname and email elements which are then mapped to two Set variable modules respectively. The scenario is available as a template here. You can however map the elements directly to one or more modules from the app you wish to send the data to.\n\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

The two latter ones are intended for advanced scenarios.\n\nActions\n\nActions are the most common module type.\n\nA typical action module returns just a single bundle which is then passed on to the next module for processing.\n\nAction modules can be placed at the beginning, middle, or end of a scenario.\n\nScenarios can contain an unlimited number of action modules.\n\nExamples:\n\nDropbox > Upload a file sends a file to a selected Dropbox folder and returns its identifier.\n\nImage > Resize receives an image, resizes it to specified dimensions, and passes the resized image on to the next action.\n\nGoogle Analytics > Create a report gets information about web traffic and passes it on for further processing.\n\nUpdate\n\nThe Action type has four sub-types: Create, Read, Update and Delete. The Update sub-type enables the following three operations:\n\nErase the content of a field. This operation takes place when the content of the field is evaluated to erase keyword (not to be confused with empty):\n\nLeave the content of a field unchanged. This operation takes place when the field is left empty or the content of the field is evaluated to empty (represented via null in JSON):\n\nReplace the content of a field. This operation takes place in all other cases than those two described above.\n\nNote\n\nIf you do not see the erase keyword in the mapping panel than either the module is not an update module or it has not been updated to the latest apps specification yet.\n\nThe reason, why it has been decided that empty will result in no change of the field content is that if there is a need to act differently and erase the field instead then it is easily achievable with the following formula:\n\nwhereas leaving the content of the field unchanged when the field's content is evaluated to empty is currently not possible.\n\nSearches\n\nA typical search module returns zero, one, or more bundles which are then passed on to the next module for processing.\n\nSearch modules can be placed at the beginning, middle, or end of a scenario.\n\nScenarios can contain an unlimited number of search modules.\n\nExamples:\n\nMonday > List pulses in all boards returns all account's pulses.\n\nTriggers\n\nTrigger modules generate bundles when there has been a change in a given service. The change can be a creation of a new record(s), deletion of a record(s), update of a record(s), etc. Make distinguishes between two types of triggers: Polling triggers and Instant triggers.\n\nEvery trigger can return zero, one, or more bundles which are then passed on to the next module for processing.\n\nTriggers can be placed only at the beginning of a scenario.\n\nEach scenario can contain only one trigger.\n\nPolling triggers\n\nPolling triggers are designed to regularly poll a given service whether there has been a change since their previous run. So you will typically schedule a scenario containing a polling trigger module to run periodically by selecting for example At regular intervals option from the Schedule setting panel. If there is a change the trigger will return bundles containing information about the change. If there is no change the trigger will output no bundles.\n\nPolling triggers allow you to select the first bundle they should output via the epoch panel. The panel is displayed automatically after you save a trigger or when you make a substantial change in the trigger settings. You can also display the panel by right-clicking the module and choosing \"Choose where to start\" from the context menu.\n\nNote\n\nSettings made in the epoch panel affect only the first execution of the module. Once the module is executed, it will remember the last outputted bundle and the settings made via epoch panel will be voided.\n\nExamples:\n\nDropbox > Watch files returns files that were newly added since the last time the scenario was run.\n\nTwitter > Watch Tweets returns new Tweets posted by the user since the last time the scenario was run.\n\nTumblr > Watch posts returns new posts added to a selected blog since the last time the scenario was run.\n\nInstant triggers\n\nInstant triggers enable the service to notify Make about the change immediately. You will typically wish to schedule a scenario containing an instant trigger to run immediately by selecting the Immediately option from the Schedule setting panel. See also Webhooks for further details on how the incoming data are handled.\n\nExamples:\n\nPaypal > New notification returns new payment notifications.\n\nAggregators\n\nAggregators are modules that accumulate multiple bundles into one single bundle.\n\nEvery aggregator returns only one bundle which is then passed on to the next module for further processing.\n\nAggregators can be placed only in the middle of a scenario.\n\nScenarios can contain an unlimited number of aggregators.\n\nExamples:\n\nArchive > Create an archive compresses received files into a zip archive.\n\nCSV > Aggregate to CSV merges multiple strings from a CSV file into a single row.\n\nTools > Text aggregator combines several strings together into one single string.\n\nIterators\n\nIterators are modules that split arrays into multiple, separate bundles.\n\nEvery iterator returns one or more bundles which are then passed on to the next module for processing.\n\nIterators can be placed only in the middle of a scenario.\n\nScenarios can contain an unlimited number of iterators.\n\nExamples:\n\nEmail > Retrieve attachments breaks an array of attachments into separate bundles.\n\nIn this section\nActions\nSearches\nTriggers\nAggregators\nIterators\nTypes of modules\nActions\nExamples:\nUpdate\nSearches\nExamples:\nTriggers\nPolling triggers\nInstant triggers\nAggregators\nExamples:\nIterators\nExamples:\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

As the services evolve, so do their APIs. New API versions are being released regularly, and old versions are being deprecated and eventually shut down. We closely follow releases of new API versions and implement new apps based on the latest APIs. During their lifecycle, apps can go through up to four phases:\n\nBeta\n\nApps in the Beta phase are labeled with the  tag in the list of apps in the Scenario editor:\n\nThe  tag denote that the API the app is based on is marked by the 3rd party service as beta. Please refer to the app's documentation for further details on this matter.\n\nEven though our QA team had thoroughly tested each app before it was released, some minor issues can still slip through. Please, do not hesitate to report these issues.\n\nStable\n\nOnce the frequency of reported issues drops, the app proceeds to the Stable phase. Apps in the Stable phase are not labeled with any special tag:\n\nDeprecated\n\nOnce a new app version (or an alternative app) is available, the old app proceeds to the Deprecated phase. The Deprecated phase is indicated by the green icon with white arrows on the app's modules in Scenario editor.\n\nIn the list of apps in the Scenario editor the Deprecated apps are suffixed with (legacy):\n\nDeprecated apps:\n\nno longer receive support\n\noften are no longer shown in the list of apps in the Scenario editor\n\nwill stop operating after a prior notice\n\nShutdown\n\nApps in the Shutdown phase no longer operate according to their specification.\n\nBefore the Shutdown phase of an app starts, we always send an email to all customers that have the Deprecated app in their scenarios and ask them to replace the Deprecated app with an alternative (usually a new version of the app). However, we highly recommend not to wait for the notification about the app shutdown and start upgrading your scenarios as soon as you spot the green icon with white arrows (indicating the app's Deprecation phase) to avoid last moment surprises.\n\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

I love Typeform! But you know what makes Typeform better? The fact that you can not only send the data to a third-party service such as a Google Sheet but also store the same on Make Data Stores.\n\nSo what exactly is a data store? It is the equivalent of a table in a database and is as easy to set up as a Google Sheet (with more versatility). Read on to see how!\n\nStep 1: Create a new scenario and add the first module\n\nThe scenario we will create today contains two modules and it looks like this:\n\nThe first is the Typeform module. Click the big question mark and search for the Typeform to see the module.\n\nOnce selected, you need to select the Trigger, which in this case is New Entry.\n\nNext, you need to add a new webhook or select an existing one followed by connecting your Typeform account if it isn’t already connected.\n\nHere, we will add a new webhook by clicking the Add button and giving it a name and then connect the Typeform account.\n\nName your webhook and connection and click Continue. You will need to authenticate Make to access your Typeform account (which is 100% safe).\n\nOnce this is done, you will see all the forms associated with your account. Select the form whose responses you would like to store and you will see that the webhook is automatically attached to that form as below:\n\nStep 2: Add the Data Store module\n\nThe next step is to add the Data Store module as shown below:\n\nSelect the first action that says Add/replace a record:\n\nStep 3: Add a new data store\n\nOnce added, you need to add a data store or select an existing one. Here, we will create a new data store, give it a name and then go on to create the data structure by clicking Add as shown below:\n\nThe next step is to add an item to your data structure. An item is the equivalent of a column in a spreadsheet (or a field/attribute in a database) and contains the response to a question (or block) in your Typeform.\n\nClick on add item to proceed:\n\nFor each item, you need to specify a name and select a type from the drop-down. We have named this item First_Name and selected text as the type. You will see more options below which are self-explanatory. Click on Add to continue.\n\nFollow the previous step to add all the items corresponding to the questions/blocks in your Typeform. We have added the following items:\n\nFirst Name\n\nLast Name\n\nPhone\n\nEmail\n\nOpt-In\n\nSave the items list followed by Saving the data store.\n\nPlease note that to edit the data store and modify the items, you will need to navigate to the Data stores under More in the collapsible menu bar on the left.\n\nStep 4: Configure your newly added data store\n\nOnce your data store is created, you will see a field named Key which can either be assigned the Typeform Entry ID (as shown below) or left blank. This is useful to retrieve a particular record containing the responses to an entry. If you leave it blank, a key is anyway generated.\n\nYou can also overwrite an existing record by specifying the custom key for that particular record. We don’t need to do this since this is a new record and contains no existing data.\n\nNow scroll down to Record to see the fields corresponding to all the items in your data store. (A row in a data store is known as a record).\n\nHere, click on each field and choose the attribute (from the ones fetched from your Typeform) that you would like to map with the item in your data store.\n\nNow hit OK, run your scenario once, submit your Typeform and see the scenario execute beautifully, and create a new record in your data store!\n\nTo view the record, you can either navigate to the Data store section in the menu and click on Browse or do so by simply clicking the Data store module right in your scenario as follows:\n\nYou record will look like the one below:\n\nLastly, just click on the little clock icon to choose the Schedule setting for your scenario, save it, and turn it on by toggling the Scheduling switch as shown below:\n\nThat’s it! You can now send the data from your Data store to Google Sheets, a CRM like InfusionSoft, or any other application by adding another module.\n\nLet us know which application you wish to see added as the next module and we will write the next tutorial for just that!\n\nHappy Automating!\n\nIn this section\nStep 1: Create a new scenario and add the first module\nStep 2: Add the Data Store module\nStep 3: Add a new data store\nStep 4: Configure your newly added data store\nTypeform Make Data Stores\nStep 1: Create a new scenario and add the first module\nStep 2: Add the Data Store module\nStep 3: Add a new data store\nStep 4: Configure your newly added data store\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Next, in step 2, you will go to the Format tab. Then as in step 3, select the Number option. And finally, select the plain text option in step 4. By doing this, you will have pre-formatted the cells, and any digits that you enter will not be converted to be a date.\n\nThe other workaround that you can do via Make is by placing an apostrophe (‘) before you enter a number, such as ’1-2019 or ‘1/47. The apostrophe isn’t displayed in the cell after the data has been sent fromMake.\n\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Then type your preferred scenario name e.g. My Personal Scenario.\n\nClick on question mark ? and select the Google Sheets app > Watch a worksheet module.\n\nSelecting the app:\n\nSelecting the module:\n\nConfigure your module.\n\nClick Add to add a connection to your Google Drive.\n\nClick Save. A new window opens where you have to Allow Access to your Google Sheet.\n\nIn the File field, specify which file Make should grab the data from. In our case it is the Twitter file.\n\nOnce you have chosen the filename, the Worksheet field will automatically appear, (in a worksheet, there can be many sheets listed) we will choose the Tweets sheet since that is the sheet we want to base our scenario off of\n\nAs for the Maximum number of returned row, specify how many results your Twitter account should grab from the Google Sheet. In our example, we will use 1 and get the unprocessed rows one by one and not all at once from our Google sheet.\n\nBut if we want to process all of the unprocessed rows all at once, then we should set the limit to a higher value (For example: 100 or higher)\n\nAfter that, we just click the OK button.\n\nAfter clicking the OK button another tab will appear:\n\nIn this field, type in the number where you want Make to choose the data from (number of row in the Google Sheet.) Kindly note that the header of the column will omit the counting. That is why we put the number 1. (So it starts at the 2nd row.)\n\nAnd, then click the OK button.\n\nThe next is to connect our 1st module to our Twitter account.\n\nWe select the Add another module button.\n\nWe select another app; Twitter app.\n\nSame as in the Google Sheets app, now we have to choose our specific module on what we want Twitter to do after Make monitors our Google sheet. In this case, we want Twitter to post a new tweet based on the current tweet that was inputted in the Google sheet tweet column.\n\nOnce we click on the module another tab will appear in the scenario.\n\nSame with the Google Sheets connection, add your Twitter connection to the scenario. (Twitter account).\n\nClick the Add button.\n\nClick the Save button.\n\nIn the new window click the Authorize App button, so that Make can access your Twitter account and link it to the Google Sheets module.\n\nAfter authorizing your Twitter account, we now have to set the status.\n\nOnce you click on the Status field, another tab will open.\n\nIn this field, specify which column we want to grab from the Google sheet which will then be redirected to the Twitter account.\n\nIn this case, we will select the Tweet (tweet) value. \n\nDrag and drop the Tweet (tweet) value to the Status field and click OK.\n\nOnce you have clicked on the OK button, you’re scenario is complete.\n\nSave your scenario.\n\nOnce you click on the Run button, the scenario will run only once until you activate your scenario with the specified time cycle.\n\nAfter executing, look at the scenario.\n\nOnly the Google Sheets module turned up green and the Twitter module did not turn green that is because our Google sheet is empty.\n\nInputting data into our Google sheet.\n\nNow, we have entered a Tweet under the Tweet column. Today is a great day.\n\nOnce we run the scenario again, notice how the Twitter module turns green.\n\nAnd then a Twitter post was created automatically.\n\nThat means that there was data processed and the result was established.\n\nSetting up your scenario for daily use.\n\nNow, we want to run our scenario in a way that we want it to run every 15 mins. (depending on your subscription plan).\n\nClick on the clock that is under the Google Sheets app.\n\nA new tab will open. If you click the dropdown button in the Run Scenario field, you have these options.\n\nBut in this case we want to run it every 15 minutes, so choose the At regular intervals option.\n\nAs for the interval of the Schedule setting”, we can set it to 15 minutes, since that is the minimum limit for a free plan.\n\nOnce we have that, click the OK** button.\n\nThe last thing we have to do is activating the scenario so we do not have to execute the scenario all the time, but it will run itself by the interval we have set which is 15 mins. \n\nClick on the Exit Editing button.\n\nAs you can notice, it will exit the editing mode. \n\nAfter that, turn on your scenario to activate it.\n\nNow, your scenario is done. Every time you input something new to the Google sheet under the Tweet column, Make will get the current data filled in every 15 mins and posts it to your Twitter account automatically.\n\nIn this section\nStep-by-Step Documentation\nGet a tweet on Twitter when a new tweet is created in a row in a Google Sheets spreadsheet\nStep-by-Step Documentation\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

This scenario watches an existing Google Sheet and is triggered when data from a row is modified.\n\nLevel of difficulty: Easy\n\nImplementation Time: Approximately 20 Minutes\n\nPrerequisites: The following is needed to set up this scenario:\n\nA Google Sheet with column names and existing data.\n\nA Discord account with permission to manage webhooks for a text channel.\n\nThe scenario for this tutorial contains only two modules and looks like this:\n\nConfigure your sheet.\n\nAs mentioned under prerequisites, you must have a Google Sheet configured with column names and some sample data. If you don’t, please create one before you proceed. This is what mine looks like:\n\nCreate a Webhook in your Discord Channel\n\nDiscord gives you the ability to create one or more webhooks for each text channel. If you’re not familiar with the process, follow the 3-step instructions below or else, jump to Step 3.\n\nUnder TEXT CHANNELS, click the settings icon next to the channel name:\n\nHead over to the Webhooks tab from the left menu and click the button labelled Create Webhook:\n\nGive the Webhook a name, copy the webhook URL, and click Save:\n\nKeep this URL handy, we will need it while setting up the HTTP module in our Make scenario.\n\nHead over to your Make dashboard to create a new scenario.\n\nClick the big question mark to set up Google Sheets as the first module and select Watch a worksheet as the trigger.\n\nChoose your Google connection or add a new one followed by selecting a file (the sheet you created earlier) and the worksheet in the file that contains the sample data. Under Maximum number of returned rows, type in the number of messages you’d like to send every time the scenario runs. If you’d like to send a separate message for each updated row, type in 1 as shown below:\n\nAfter clicking OK, you’ll see another dialog box asking you to either enter the row number from which you’d like the module to start looking for updates or select All rows.\n\nNote\n\nThe first row or header row is always assumed to contain the column names. Hence, if you enter 1, entries will be watched starting the row below the header row.\n\nConfigure the HTTP module as the Action\n\nThe HTTP module is the second and the last module in the scenario that performs the action of sending a message to a discord channel.\n\nSearch for the HTTP module and select Make a request as the action:\n\nUnder URL, paste the Webhook URL obtained from the Discord channel earlier.\n\nUnder Method, select POST.\n\nUnder Body Type, select Raw.\n\nUnder Content Type, select JSON (application/json).\n\nFinally, under Request Content, type in the message to be sent to the channel as a JSON payload as per Discord’s API. To send a message (string), the Field type is content, hence the JSON payload should be written as follows:\n\n“content” : “Houston, this is a message for Discord”\n\nClick here to learn more about executing webhooks on Discord.\n\nSince the trigger is a Google Sheet with columns containing data, we can use the column names to include the contents of each cell in the message that is sent to the channel. We may also use line breaks (\\n) in the message. Below is what I have composed:\n\n“content” : “**Incoming Status Update**\\nName: {{firstname}} {{lastname}}\\nMission: {{mission}}\\nStatus: {{status}}”\n\nClick OK to complete the scenario. You must save the scenario and toggle the Scheduling switch to ON.\n\nTo define the schedule for the scenario, click the little clock icon next to the toggle switch or the big clock animation on the Google Sheets module image as shown below:\n\nYou may also rename the modules and add notes under each by right-clicking the module image:\n\nThat’s it. Now update some data in your sheet and run your module once to make sure everything works fine as shown below:\n\nHope you were able to implement this scenario with ease.\n\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

After that, Make will get the TwitterID and the date that the tweet was posted and update a specified Google Sheet row.\n\nFinal Output\n\nStep-by-step documentation\n\nBased on the final output, there are three modules that are being used for this scenario.\n\nAdd two more columns in your Twitter Google Sheet with the header names Date and TweetID.\n\nFrom your first exercise, add another module that updates your Google sheet with the date and the TwitterID after Make posts your tweet on your Twitter account.\n\nClick on the white field shown in the image below and then two options will appear, click on the Add another module button.\n\nSelect the app and its corresponding module.\n\nType Google Sheets and click on the app as shown below.\n\nClick on the corresponding module Update a row. This module will update your Tweet Google sheet with the date and TwitterID of your current Twitter post.\n\nOnce you have your new module, a new tab will automatically pop up where you have to configure your Google Sheets settings as we did in exercise 1.\n\nFirst, click on the Add button and give Make access to your Twitter Google Sheet.\n\nWhen you click on the Add button it pops up a new window and then click the Save button and then another window will open which is your Google Drive account.\n\nOn the newly popped up window click on the Allow button to give Make access to your Google Account.\n\nOnce that is clicked, go back to your Make scenario, and then you have to choose the specific sheet that you want Make to choose the tweet from. In our case, it is the Twitter Google Sheet.\n\nFrom the File field, a drop-down will list all of your sheets available, and then choose the Twitter sheet.\n\nAfter choosing the Twitter sheet, a few more fields will automatically appear below.\n\nUnder the Worksheet field, choose the Tweets sheet because that is where the additional header titles Date and TwitterID are added.\n\nNext, is the listed data inside the Tweet sheet, we have to correspond each specific field, on what data should be added to be updated.\n\nIn this case, we want the Date and the TwitterID to be added in the Google Sheet once the current tweet was posted on Twitter.\n\nFor the Date(date) field, drag the now variable to the field, that means that Make will get the date and time of the status that you have created right now.\n\nAs you can see in the image above, we have chosen the color blue variable now, the blue color stands for the Twitter module, because we want the date of the Tweet to come from Twitter and not from the first Google sheet.\n\nSame goes with the TweetID field, as shown in the image below. We want the TweetID to come from Twitter and not from Google Sheets.\n\nAs for the RowID field, we have to get this from the Google Sheet module. Because the last module wants to know which tweet should be updated, so we have to set the row of that specific field.\n\nAs you can see, the color of the variable is green that is because we grabbed the data from the first module and we are getting the row of the tweet from the Google Sheet.\n\nAfter inputting all the variables, your tab should look like this:\n\nIf your tab looks like this, then click the OK button.\n\nRun and execute your scenario.\n\nTo test your scenario, add a new tweet to your Tweets sheet.\n\nRun your scenario once to see the flow of your scenario.\n\nAfter running the scenario, all of your modules should have a green letter as shown in the image below.\n\nThat means that all of our modules have run properly and the data was processed properly.\n\nCheck your Twitter account.\n\nSee that the tweet from the Google sheet was processed and automatically transported to your Twitter account.\n\nAnd now, we check the Google sheet of the date and TweetID was added.\n\nWe can see that the date and TweetID value has been added and therefore our Google Sheet has been updated.\n\nSetting up your scenario for daily use.\n\nSet up your scenario so that it runs every 15 mins. (Depending on your subscription plan). Please see below.\n\nAs a free member your minimum number of minutes per cycle is 15 mins. (Based on what we are using in the example).\n\nClick on the clock that is under the Google Sheet app.\n\nA new tab will open.\n\nIf you click the dropdown button in the Run Scenario field, you have these options:\n\nBut in this case, you want to choose every 15 minutes, that is why you choose the At regular intervals option.\n\nAs for the interval of the Schedule Setting, we can set it to 15 mins, since that is the minimum limit set by the rules of Make.\n\nOnce we have that, click the OK button.\n\nThe last thing we have to do is activate the scenario so we do not have to execute the scenario all the time, but it will run itself by the cycle that we have set which is 15 mins.\n\nClick on the Exit Editing button.\n\nAs you can notice, it will exit the editing mode.\n\nAfter that, turn on your scenario to activate it.\n\nNow, your scenario is done.\n\nEverytime you input something new to the Google Sheet row, Make will get the current row that is filled every 15 mins and post it to your Twitter account and updates your Google Sheet row with the Date and TweetID automatically.\n\nIn this section\nStep-by-step documentation\nUpdate Google Sheet row with TwitterID and Date after posting it on Twitter\nStep-by-step documentation\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

The full version will come later. We would like to encourage you to provide us with your feedback in Make Community, so we will be able to improve the On-prem agent feature and make it comfortable for you to work with.\n\nThe On-prem agent is available only on the Enterprise plan.\n\nThe general On-prem agent architecture:\n\nOne On-prem agent can connect to many applications that are located in the same network. Currently, we provide an HTTP Agent app that allows connecting with other custom systems that provide an API or a web service.\n\nThe deeper visual explanation of the solution:\n\nTo start using an On-prem agent in your scenarios, you need to:\n\nCreate a new On-prem agent in the On-prem agents section of the Organization dashboard.\n\nDownload the On-prem agent and install it on your device.\n\nConnect a system (an application) to the installed On-prem agent.\n\nAdd a connection between Make and the connected system when adding the application module in your scenario.\n\nAdding an On-prem agent\n\nThe installation process consists of three steps:\n\nCreating an On-prem agent in the On-prem agents section, in Make.\n\nDownloading the On-prem agent to your device.\n\nInstalling the On-prem agent on your device.\n\nImportant\n\nOnly users with the Owner, Admin, and App dev organization roles can perform all three steps.\n\nCreating an On-prem agent\n\nFirst, you need to create a new On-prem agent in Make.\n\nGo to the Organization section, the On-prem agents tab, and click Create a new on-prem agent. A window appears.\n\nIn the On-prem agent name field, enter the agent name.\n\nClick Create agent. A page with credentials appears.\n\nSave the Client ID, the Secret, and the Base URL because you will need these credentials in the installation stage later. Check I saved my credentials.\n\nWarning\n\nMake sure to save the credentials in this step in a secure location. This is the only time when Make shows the On-prem agent credentials.\n\nClick Download installer.\n\nMake redirects you to the download page, where you can choose your device OS and download the On-prem agent installer. In the Organization section, on the On-prem Agent tab, you can see the created On-prem agent with the Registered status.\n\nDownloading the On-prem agent\n\nYou need to download the installation package for the On-prem agent to run on your device.\n\nAfter creating the On-prem agent, Make redirects you to the download page.\n\nSelect the OS of your device, and click Download.\n\nTip\n\nFor macOS download the file for Linux: it is a .ZIP archive you will have to unzip when installing.\n\nTip\n\nIf the auto-download doesn't start automatically, follow the link that appears after you click Download.\n\nDefine where you want to save the On-prem agent installation package on your device.\n\nClick Save.\n\nYou downloaded the On-prem agent installation package to your device. You're ready to install the On-prem agent.\n\nInstalling the On-prem agent\n\nInstallation is the last step you need to start using the On-prem agent in Make. Here you will find steps for installing the On-prem agent on Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nInstallation for Windows\nInstallation for macOS\nInstallation for Linux\nConnecting a system\n\nOnce you installed the On-prem agent, you can connect it to an application (a connected system). You can connect several systems to one On-prem agent.\n\nImportant\n\nOnly users with the Owner, Admin, and App dev organization roles can connect a system.\n\nNote\n\nIn the BETA version, Make supports only HTTP Agent for the On-prem agent. There will be more apps in the future.\n\nConnect the HTTP system\n\nGo to the On-prem agents section and click the active agent that you want to use for a particular system (application).\n\nClick Connect system.\n\nIn the Name field, insert a connection name. This name appears when adding an application module to a scenario.\n\nIn the Choose app to connect dropdown list, select the HTTP Agent app.\n\nDefine the base URL to the application API.\n\nTip\n\nThe URL contains a host, a port, and a definition of API for a particular app. If the app runs on the same device where the On-prem agent is installed, the host is localhost. If the app runs on another device, the host is the device IP address. The port and the API definition vary based on the app.\n\nIn this example URL: https://localhost:3000/api:\n\nthe host is localhost\n\nthe port is 3000\n\nthe definition of API is /api\n\nIn the URL field, insert the URL to the application API.\n\nClick Save.\n\nIn the connected systems list, you see a new connection that works with this specific On-prem agent. Now you can start building a scenario.\n\nNote\n\nYou might be asked to renew the access to the connected system after a certain period of time. If so, click Revoke in the Connected systems section.\n\nCreating a connection in the scenario\n\nTo create a connection , go to the scenario editor.\n\nNote\n\nCurrently, Make supports only HTTP Agent application for the On-prem agent usage.\n\nClick Create a new scenario.\n\nSelect the HTTP Agent from the dropdown list.\n\nSelect a module and connect it to Make.\n\nFinish configuring the module settings.\n\nAfter adding the module, you can continue building your scenario.

Later you can select the same hook from the dropdown menu:\n\nName your webhook. We have called it Chatfuel_Bot_Note:\n\nYou will see that your Webhook URLhas been created. Copy Webhook URL. and move on to Part 2.\n\nPart 2: Set up the JSON plugin in Chatfuel\n\nTo send data from your Chatfuel (CF) bot to any external service, you need to use the JSON APl plugin inside a CF Block.\n\nUnder TYPE, choose the POST method. POST is more secure than GET. To learn more about the differences between the two, follow this link.\n\nUnder URL, paste your Webhook URL that you got from Make in the previous step.\n\nUnder USER ATTRIBUTES, select all the attributes that contain data that you wish to send to your Airtable.\n\nOnce the above steps are done, it should look like this:\n\nWe have passed only 4 attributes but you can pass all the attributes containing data you wish to send to the Airtable.\n\nNext, you need to trigger the block containing the above plugin for Make to determine the data structure based on the attributes you’re trying to pass. You can do this by testing your bot and arriving at this block or by creating a link with the REF parameter from the top of the block.\n\nIMP: Do the above before you proceed, else you will not see the attributes appear on the next module.\n\nOnce this is done, before you proceed, head over to Airtable and create your bot base (this is the same as creating a new file on Google sheets) and set up the columns as fields for your bot data:\n\nStep 3: Set up the Airtable module\n\nTo set up Airtable as the next module, click on add another module and look for Airtable:\n\nNext, click on Airtable, and choose the Create a record as the action:\n\nNow connect your Airtable account by clicking on Add under Connection. Here you need to provide your Airtable credentials as well as your API Key which can be found under your Account settings on Airtable (https://airtable.com/account):\n\nOnce the connection is successful, you will be able to see all the bases in the dropdown labeled Table. Choose the base that you created in the previous step:\n\nIf you have connected to the correct base, you will see the fields corresponding to the columns you created earlier. All you need to do is place the bot attributes in the respective fields and hit OK to run the scenario and create a new record on Airtable:\n\nBut before you run it, you need to do a little something so that you don’t receive an error message in your bot. Add another module and select webhook response:\n\nIn the body, create a JSON object by typing in { “success” : “true” } :\n\nThis is to ensure a proper response is sent back to Chatfuel to avoid the all too common — “an error in JSON Plugin has occurred” message. The bot itself does not respond with anything since the JSON is not as per the format Chatfuel accepts. However, if you’d like the bot to respond with a message, you can refer to Chatfuel’s JSON API docs.\n\nNow click on the big blue play button that says Run once. If everything goes well, you should see the scenario execute itself flawlessly and your Airtable will have a shiny new record!\n\nLastly, just click on the little clock icon to choose the Schedule setting for your scenario, save it and turn it on by toggling the switch on the bottom:\n\nThat’s it! That was easy, wasn’t it?\n\nLet us know what you think of this tutorial and how we can improve it. If you were stuck somewhere, please leave us a comment! If you have suggestions for the next topic, do tell.\n\nIn this section\nPart 1: Create a Scenario\nHow to connect Chatfuel to Airtable\nPart 1: Create a Scenario\nPart 2: Set up the JSON plugin in Chatfuel\nStep 3: Set up the Airtable module\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

If you’re not, refer to the following articles:\n\nChatfuel and Webhooks: How to connect Chatfuel to Airtable\n\nExpressions: Connect Email, Text Parser, and Google Sheets\n\nData Stores: Typeform + Integromat Data Stores\n\nScenario: Capture email and phone via Webhooks, validate them individually by filtering using Regular Expressions (Regex) as match patterns, store the valid entries in a Data Store and respond to invalid entries via Responsive Webhooks.\n\nNote: We have used Chatfuel but you can use any app that supports Webhooks or replace the Webhook module with any other app supported by Make.\n\nLevel of difficulty: Medium \n\nImplementation Time: Approximately 30 Minutes\n\nWhile most apps have inbuilt validation, many are not thorough so an unwanted entry may slip through. Chatfuel’s email validation accepts a@b as a valid email which is a problem, especially if you’re using a CRM like InfusionSoft to create a new contact with that email address. InfusionSoft’s validation is more thorough and it returns an error on receiving a wrongly formatted email, which can result in your scenario being paused. In such cases, you’ll receive an email from Make as below:\n\nTo avoid these errors altogether and ensure that you capture data in a valid format, you can set up filters before passing that data to the next module. Using Regular Expressions as Match Patterns, you can effectively validate email addresses and phone numbers.\n\nNote\n\nThis tutorial helps you to validate the format of the input and NOT to verify if an email or phone exists or matches previous records.\n\nSee more about the difference between validation with verification.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will help you validate an email address followed by a phone number. If both are valid, we will update a record in a Data Store. Read more about Data Stores.\n\nYou can follow the same process to create a row in a Google Sheet or an Airtable Base. If either the email or the phone is invalid, a Webhook Response is set up to prompt the user to retry. The scenario looks like below.\n\nConfigure a webhook to receive data\n\nAdd the Webhook module. You can select an existing webhook or create a new one.\n\nCopy the URL to paste it in the JSON plugin in Chatfuel.\n\nIf you are new to this, please refer to Step 1 in the Chatfuel Integration tutorial. We have named this module ‘Validation Webhook’.\n\nCreate the flow in Chatfuel\n\nGo to Chatfuel to set up the requisite blocks and plugins.\n\nTo capture data, you can either use the User Input plugin or the newly added User Email and User Phone plugins.\n\nAs an example, we will create the following five blocks (feel free to use your own nomenclature for blocks and attributes):\n\nemail_capture\n\nemail_invalid\n\nphone_capture\n\nphone_invalid\n\nvalidation_true\n\nThe setup for all five blocks are shown below:\n\nBLOCK NAME: EMAIL_CAPTURE\n\nStart with a Setup user attribute plugin and create an attribute called ‘email_validation’ with the value ‘not set’.\n\nAdd a User Email or User Input plugin and save the input to the ‘email’ attribute (leave the Validation as ‘None’ if using the User Input plugin).\n\nOR\n\nAdd a JSON API plugin, choose POST, paste your Webhook URL and add the attributes {{first name}}, {{last name}} and {{email}}.\n\nAdd a Go to block plugin and redirect to the ‘phone_capture’ block with the following filter:\n\nattribute → email_validation → is → not set\n\nAdd another Go to block plugin and redirect to the ‘email_invalid’ block with the following filter:\n\nattribute → email_validation → is → false\n\nClone the ‘email_capture’ block and rename it as above.\n\nNote\n\nNote: If want, you may redirect back to the ‘email_capture’ block instead of ‘email_invalid’ and return a message such as “email is invalid, please try again” from the webhook response directly.\n\nBLOCK NAME: EMAIL_INVALID\n\nClone the ‘email_capture’ block and rename it as above.\n\nAdd the following text block after the Setup user attribute plugin:\n\nThis allows you to show the invalid email that a user had typed in and give an option to skip this step. The rest of the block remains as is.\n\nBLOCK NAME: PHONE_CAPTURE\n\nLike the email_capture block, set up a user attribute called ‘phone_validation’ with the value ‘not set’\n\nAdd the User Phone or the User Input Plugin (leaving the Validation as ‘None’)\n\nSetup the JSON plugin with the same Webhook URL as the one in the previous blocks and pass the following attributes:\n\n{{first name}}, {{last name}}, {{email}} and {{phone}}\n\nAdd a Go to block plugin and redirect to the ‘validation_true’ block if phone_validation is “true” AND email_validation is “true”\n\nNote\n\nNote: The above attributes are assigned the value ‘true’ via the webhook response when both email and phone are valid (explained later). This scenario will work even if only phone_validation is true.\n\nSetup another Go to block plugin and redirect to ‘phone_invalid’ if phone_validation is “false”.\n\nBLOCK NAME: PHONE_INVALID\n\nClone the ‘phone_capture’ block and rename it as above. And add the following text block after the Setup user attribute plugin:\n\nThe rest of the block remains the same as before.\n\nBLOCK NAME: VALIDATION_TRUE\n\nJust add a text block as shown below:\n\nThis is the block you will send the user to if both email and phone are valid.\n\nStep 3: Setup the router module in Make\n\nRouter is an incredible module that lets you filter data when setting up multiple Actions to a Trigger. It can be found under ‘Flow Control’.\n\nIn this scenario, we will use a Router for the following actions:\n\nSend a response to the Validation Webhook if the email is invalid\n\nSend a response to the Validation Webhook if the phone is invalid\n\nAdd a row in a Data Store followed by a response to the Validation Webhook if both email and phone are valid\n\nAdd a Webhook response and set up a filter to check if the email is invalid:\n\nThe Body of the webhook response contains the following JSON that assigns the value ‘false’ to the attribute email_validation:\n\n{\n\n\"set_attributes\":  {\n\n\"email_validation\": \"false\"\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nThe filter contains the following condition:\n\nemail → Does not match pattern → ([\\w.-]+@[\\w.-]+)\n\nThe response is sent if the value of the attribute email does not match the format of the Regular Expression.\n\nYou can test the above on https://regex101.com/ by pasting the regex,([\\w.-]+@[\\w.-]+) under REGULAR EXPRESSION and typing in an email address under TEST STRING. Make sure you choose Javascript as the FLAVOR.\n\nSimilarly, add another route with the Webhook response with a filter to check if the phone is invalid:\n\nThe Body of the webhook assigns the value ‘false’ to the attribute phone_validation:\n\n{  \n\n\"set_attributes\":  \n\n{    \n\n\"phone_validation\": \"false\" \n\n }\n\n}\n\nThe filter contains the following condition:\n\nphone → Does not match pattern →  ^[+]?\\(?(\\d{1,3})\\)?[\\s-]?\\(?(\\d{3})\\)?[\\s-]?\\d{3}[\\s-]?\\d{3,4}\n\nThe response is sent if the value of the attribute phone does not match the format of the Regex above.\n\nAdd the last route with the Data store module with a filter to check if both email and phone are valid, followed by a Webhook response.\n\nUnder Data store, select Add/replace a row as the Action:\n\nCreate a Data store if you haven’t already and set it up as shown below: (If you’re not familiar with this, please refer to Step 2 in this tutorial)\n\nThis is the most important step. Add a filter to check if both email and phone are valid. The filter contains the following condition:\n\nphone → Matches pattern →  ^[+]?\\(?(\\d{1,3})\\)?[\\s-]?\\(?(\\d{3})\\)?[\\s-]?\\d{3}[\\s-]?\\d{3,4}\n\nAND\n\nemail → Matches pattern (case insensitive) → ([\\w.-]+@[\\w.-]+)\n\nLastly, add a webhook response with the following JSON that assigns the value ‘true’ to both email_validation and phone_validation:\n\n{  \n\n\"set_attributes\":  {\n\n\"email_validation\": \"true\",    \n\n\"phone_validation\": \"true\"\n\n  } \n\n}\n\nAt this point, you must save your scenario and rename the modules to keep the setup clean and toggle the Scheduling switch to ON.\n\nIf you have followed the tutorial correctly, your Chatfuel bot is all set to validate emails and phone numbers and store them in a Data store. If both are valid, you should see a new row as below:\n\nWow! If you’ve got this far, I hope you’ve learned a thing or two. Do leave a comment if you have queries or are stuck somewhere.\n\nHappy automating!\n\nIn this section\nConfigure a webhook to receive data\nCreate the flow in Chatfuel\nStep 3: Setup the router module in Make\nHow to capture Email and Phone via Webhooks, validate them using Regex and store them in a Data Store\nConfigure a webhook to receive data\nCreate the flow in Chatfuel\nStep 3: Setup the router module in Make\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

In this tutorial, the first pattern will search for a phrase and the second will search for the same phrase and an email address.\n\nLevel of difficulty: Medium (requires basic knowledge of Regular Expressions). Learn more about Regex.\n\nImplementation Time: Approximately 20 Minutes\n\nThe scenario that we will create in this tutorial will look like snapshot above.\n\nStep 1: Adding and configuring Email module\n\nSearch for Email and choose Watch emails as the Trigger.\n\nNote\n\nYou can connect a Google account using the Email module. You can also use the inbuilt Gmail module instead.\n\nConnect either a Google account or any other IMAP based email client (Hotmail, Outlook, Zoho etc). We use a Google account as an example.\n\nOnce connected, select a Folder whose incoming emails you wish to watch (e.g. all email, inbox).\n\nUnder Criteria, choose if you want to watch all emails, or if you want to narrow it down to only read or only unread email.\n\nYou can filter emails by the Sender email address, Recipient email address, Subject and Phrase, which enables you to watch only relevant emails.\n\nYou can also choose to mark fetched emails as read or unread.\n\nSet the Maximum number of results based on the volume of messages you receive. We recommended setting a low value and run the scenario more often.\n\nClick OK to save your settings.\n\nOnce the configuration is done, the system asks you to choose where to start watching your emails. Click OK to confirm.\n\nStep 2: Search for Flow Control and add a Router\n\nYou can add router after any module to split or duplicate the data before sending it to the next module. Here, we have used a Router to send the Email body text to 2 separate tables in a Google Sheet. More on that in the next step.\n\nStep 3: Using Text Parser Module\n\nAdd Text Parser > Match Pattern transformer to search for a phrase in an email.\n\nEnter Pattern. The search pattern is a regular expression and has to be written as text\\sparser\\smodule\n\nMultiline is useful if your text contains several lines and you need to search for the pattern in each line. For this tutorial we need to search for the pattern in the entire email body text, hence we will leave it unchecked.\n\nIn the Text field, select the attribute ‘Text content’ from the list. This attribute stores the text from the email body in which we will search for the pattern. Click OK to save.\n\nAdd another Match Pattern that searches for the same phrase and an email address. This is particularly useful if you have customer accounts with multiple users. To save time, simply clone the Text Parser module you just created and link it to the Router.\n\nEdit the pattern as below:\n\ntext\\sparser\\smodule.+\\s([\\w.-]+@[\\w.-]+)\n\nThis pattern searches for the phrase “text parser module” and an email address like jim.morrison@gmail.com and returns only the email address. It’s important to write your regex in accordance with the specification of the email addresses you accept.The pattern above works for most standard email addresses, e.g. name.surname@gmail.com.\n\nPlease note that while it’s important to write your regex in accordance with the specification of the email addresses you accept, the one above takes care of most standard email addresses.\n\nTo search only for email address, use the regex below:\n\n([\\w.-]+@[\\w.-]+)\n\nTo search only for phone numbers using the regex below:\n\n^[+]?\\(?(\\d{1,3})\\)?[\\s-]?\\(?(\\d{3})\\)?[\\s-]?\\d{3}[\\s-]?\\d{3,4}\n\nThe above pattern takes care of most common formats in which a phone number is written.\n\nTo test your patterns, we recommend using https://regex101.com with javascript as the Flavor.\n\nThe rest of the configuration remains the same as the one before.\n\nStep 4: Add Google Sheets Modules\nNote\n\nInstead of Google Sheets, you may use another app like Airtable or a CRM such as InfusionSoft.\n\nCreate a spreadsheet with the columns under which want to capture the user data. You can also use an existing file.\n\nAs an example, we have created one called “Email Data: Support Ticket” with Sender Name, Sender Email and Email Content as columns. We have named the worksheet ‘contains: text parser module’.\n\nAdd the Google Sheets > Add a row module.\n\nConnect your Google account (if you haven’t already). Choose the File you created earlier, followed by choosing the Worksheet in which you’re capturing the data. My setup looks like this:\n\nMap the attributes in the relevant fields (columns) to finish the module setup.\n\nStep 5: Clone Google Sheets module and linking it to the second Text Parser module\n\nGo to your Spreadsheet, duplicate the worksheet you created earlier and give it a name.\n\nAdd another column to store the email address that the email body contains.\n\nClick on the cloned Google Sheets module to configure the setup.\n\nChange the worksheet to the new one you just created.\n\nMap the output from the Match Pattern module ($1) to the column where you wish to store the email address.\n\nClick OK, save the scenario and run it to test.\n\nSend two separate emails to the connected email address as follows:\n\nContaining the phrase “text parser module” (and no email address)\n\nContaining the above phrase and an email address.\n\nIf there are no errors in your setup, the first worksheet captures all emails containing the phrase “text parser module”. The second worksheet captures only those that contain the phrase “text parser module” and an email address. You may refer to the screenshots below.\n\nWorksheet 1\n\nWorksheet 2\n\nLearn more\n\nFree exercises to learn about Regular Expressions\n\nLearn about Phone Number Matching using Regex\n\nLearn about Email Matching using Regex\n\nTest your regular expressions\n\nIn this section\nStep 1: Adding and configuring Email module\nStep 2: Search for Flow Control and add a Router\nStep 3: Using Text Parser Module\nStep 4: Add Google Sheets Modules\nStep 5: Clone Google Sheets module and linking it to the second Text Parser module\nLearn more\nHow to connect Email, Text Parser and Google Sheets\nStep 1: Adding and configuring Email module\nStep 2: Search for Flow Control and add a Router\nStep 3: Using Text Parser Module\nStep 4: Add Google Sheets Modules\nStep 5: Clone Google Sheets module and linking it to the second Text Parser module\nLearn more\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

These actions can include informing your office manager that a new employee is starting, assigning onboarding tasks to the new employee’s manager, etc.\n\nStep 2: Connect to Google Sheets\n\nIf you already authenticated your connection inside Make, the dropdown shows the previously connected account as an option.\n\nIf you are using Google Sheets on Make for the first time, follow the steps below.\n\nIn Connection, click Add button to add a new connection. You need the connection to allow Make to work with your spreadsheets.\n\nA pop-up appears.\n\nEnter your connection name. \n\nIn case you have several Google accounts, we recommend naming your connections differently so you can distinguish them.\n\nYou can also leave the connection name field as is.\n\nClick Save.\n\nA new window appears.\n\nSelect and click your Google account.\n\nA new window appears.\n\nClick Allow to allow Make to access your Google account.\n\nYou added your connection. Your new connection appears under the Connection field.\n\nStep 3: Configure the module\n\nIn this step, we need to complete the fields required by the module.\n\nUnder Choose a Drive, select your drive.\n\nIn Spreadsheet ID, select your spreadsheet.\n\nIf your spreadsheet is located in the folder, first select the folder. Then, click the plus sign to select the specific spreadsheet in the folder.\n\nIn Sheet, select the sheet name.\n\nSelect whether your table contains headers. Our table contains headers, but yours doesn't have to.\n\nIn Row with headers, enter the range of the table (headers included).\n\nIn Limit, enter the number of results you’d like to obtain. Whenever this workflow runs, it will return this number of results.\n\nClick OK to save.\n\nStep 4: Choose where to start\n\nChoose where Make should start looking for data to process.\n\nFor Google Sheets, you can choose:\n\nSince specific ID - You have to provide a parameter.\n\nAll - We process all records found in the spreadsheet.\n\nChoose manually - You can pick the one you’d like to process first.\n\nWe use All, which is useful when testing new scenarios.\n\nClick OK to save.\n\nYour Google Sheets trigger module is completed.\n\nBy default, Make checks for new rows every 15 minutes and processes all the records created since the last time it checked. If you want to set a different schedule for your scenario, see step 6.\n\nStep 5: Select the action module\n\nDepending on what you want to do next, select your next module. You can send the data from Google Sheets to any of our 1000+ apps.\n\nWe will add a Slack module which will send a new Slack message to the office manager letting them know a new employee is starting.\n\nHover over the right part of the Google Sheets module. The plus sign appears.\n\nClick Add another module. An empty module appears.\n\nSearch for and click the module you want. In this case, select Slack > Create a message module.\n\nIf you already authenticated your Slack connection inside Make, the dropdown shows the previously connected account as an option.\n\nIf you are using Slack on Make for the first time, you need to follow the instructions below to add and authorize the Slack connection.\n\nIn Connection, click Add.\n\nA pop-up appears.\n\nConnect as a user if you want Slack to send messages in your name.\n\nConnect as a bot if you want Slack to send messages as the Make app (bot).\n\nEnter your connection name and click Save.\n\nA new window appears. Sign in to your Slack.\n\nClick Allow to authorize Make to access Slack.\n\nSelect if you want to enter a channel ID or name manually or choose from the list.\n\nEnter or select a channel you want to send the message to.\n\nIt can be a public channel, a private channel, or an IM channel.\n\nTo select a user, use the IM channel option and then select a user name. You can first try sending the message to yourself.\n\n(Optional step)\n\nIf you chose the Bot option, you can define a custom bot name in the Advanced settings of this module.\n\nStep 6: Map data from Google Sheets\n\nMapping means telling Make how it should move data from one app to another.\n\nWe want to compose a Slack message with the details of the new hire.\n\nClick the Text field.\n\nThe mapping dialog opens.\n\nSelect data from the spreadsheet you want to use in the Slack message.\n\nClick the variables from the spreadsheet (they will have the same color as the module) to add them to the message text.\n\nFor example:\n\nHi, our new [Team] hire [Employee name] is starting on [Starting date]. Please prepare everything for their first day, thank you!\n\nwill produce this as a result:\n\nHi, our new Marketing hire Sarah is starting on 14-Jul-2022. Please prepare everything for their first day, thank you!\n\nConfirm OK to save the settings.\n\nStep 7: Test your scenario\n\nTo verify that everything works as expected, test your scenario by clicking the Run once button.\n\nIf your scenario runs successfully, green checkmarks appear under the modules. Also, the messages(s) are delivered on Slack.\n\nThe modules should also have bubbles above them indicating how many operations the scenario used. Every time an app performs an action such as reading or writing data, it consumes an operation. Learn more about operations.\n\nClick the bubble above the module to see the details of what the module just processed. The Google Sheets module in the screenshot below shows that it processed two rows of data (bundle 1 and bundle 2).\n\nThe Slack module shows that it sent 2 messages. Each message contains data from one of the rows from Google Sheets.\n\nStep 8: Activate your scenario\n\nIf the scenario works as expected, you can activate it to make it run on a schedule.\n\nClick the Schedule button or the clock icon next to the Google Sheets module.\n\nChoose how often the scenario should run. The default is every 15 minutes.\n\nActivate the scenario using the Scheduling switch.\n\nSave the scenario.\n\nThat is it! You now have a working scenario that does a repetitive task for you!\n\nUse case 2: Get data from other apps and add it to Google Sheets as new rows\n\nThis use case has 2 app modules - Gmail and Google Sheets. The Gmail module looks for new emails and filters those that have “Expense Report” in their subject line. Then, the Google Sheets module adds matching emails as new rows in a spreadsheet, where we can track if an expense report was paid or not.\n\nWatch for incoming emails and add a row to Google Sheets\n\nFollow these steps to build the scenario:\n\nChoose Gmail as the trigger module\n\nMap the variables from Gmail in the Google Sheets module\n\nChoose where to start\n\nTest the scenario\n\nDefine the scenario schedule\n\nActivate the scenario\n\nStep 1: Choose Gmail as the trigger module\n\nSelect the Gmail app and choose the trigger Watch Emails from the list. Then proceed as follows:\n\nConnect your Google Account if you haven’t done so before.\n\nNote: If you are using a personal Gmail account, there are some extra connection steps required for using Gmail and Google Drive apps. Learn more.\n\nSelect the folder to monitor in your inbox.\n\nChoose Gmail filter as the filter type.\n\nAdd the keyword to use for filtering in the “Query” field.\n\nWe want Gmail to return only emails with “Expense Report” phrase in the subject line. So we enter “Expense report” in the \"Query\" field.\n\nYou can enter any other words or phrases you want Gmail to filter. For example “Invoice”, “Demo request”, etc.\n\nSelect whether you want Make to mark the emails as read or unread when fetched.\n\nSelect the maximum number of results you’d like to return per execution (one run of the scenario).\n\nGmail module configuration\n\nStep 2: Map the variables from Gmail in the Google Sheets module\n\nThe process of mapping consists of using data from the previous module and adding it to subsequent modules in your scenario. In this example, our spreadsheet for tracking expenses looks like this:\n\nWe have these columns in our spreadsheet:\n\nA: Expense ID - The subject line of the email\n\nB: Status - The status of the expense\n\nC: Paid? - Shows whether the expense was paid or not\n\nGoogle Sheets module - mapping Subject\n\nNote that the subject variable is highlighted in red, which indicates that the value will come from the Gmail module. The other fields are typed in manually, so they will always be Status = Approved and Paid = No.\n\nStep 3: Choose where to start\n\nNow that your modules are set up, pick the starting point in your inbox - where Make should start looking for data. Right-click the Gmail module and select Choose where to start.\n\nAction panel for the Gmail module\n\nOptions available in the “Choose where to start” configuration\n\nFrom now on: The module processes only new incoming emails that come in after you activate your scenario.\n\nEmails from after a specific date: You can select a date from which the emails will be processed.\n\nAll emails: It will go through your entire inbox (but grab only 3 records, which is what we defined in Step 1).\n\nSelect the first email: You can manually select the email you’d like to process. Usually, this is useful for testing purposes.\n\nWhen building and testing scenarios, select All emails to ensure you have data coming in. Once you are finished with the setup, you can choose From now on to only process new incoming emails.\n\nStep 4: Test the scenario\n\nThe next step is to run the scenario at least once to see its outcome. Click the Run once button to test your scenario.\n\nIf the scenario runs successfully, green checkmarks appear under the modules. You should also see new rows added in your spreadsheet.\n\nClick the numbers above the modules to see the details of how the data was processed and the output of the scenario.\n\nThe number 3 in the bubble means that the Google Sheets module has consumed 3 operations, one for each email that it has found and processed. In our case for operation 1, 1 row was updated, 3 columns and 3 cells.\n\nStep 5: Define the scenario schedule\n\nDefine how often the scenario should run.\n\nBy default, a scenario runs every 15 minutes. With the schedule settings, you can customize the run schedule of your scenario. You can choose the interval, pick a specific date and time, or other options. Learn more about scheduling.\n\nClick on the clock icon next to the trigger module, or the Schedule setting button in the bottom toolbar.\n\nSelect how often you want your scenario to run.\n\nClick OK to save your settings.\n\nSchedule settings configuration\n\nStep 6: Activate the scenario\n\nNow it’s time to activate your scenario and let it run according to the conditions you specified in the previous steps.\n\nClick on the scheduling button to activate your scenario.\n\nClick the save icon to save your scenario.\n\nHow to activate your scenario\n\nHere are a few more examples with links to our templates:\n\nSend an email every time a new row is added to your spreadsheet\n\nSend a message to Slack every time a new row is added to your spreadsheet\n\nAdd leads from Facebook Lead Ads to Google Sheets as new rows\n\nIn this section\nWatch the video\nUse case 1: Trigger a workflow when a new row is added to a spreadsheet and send that data to another app\nUse case 2: Get data from other apps and add it to Google Sheets as new rows\nUsing Google Sheets with Make\nWatch the video\nUse case 1: Trigger a workflow when a new row is added to a spreadsheet and send that data to another app\nStep 1 - Choose a trigger\nStep 2: Connect to Google Sheets\nStep 3: Configure the module\nStep 4: Choose where to start\nStep 5: Select the action module\nStep 6: Map data from Google Sheets\nStep 7: Test your scenario\nStep 8: Activate your scenario\nUse case 2: Get data from other apps and add it to Google Sheets as new rows\nStep 1: Choose Gmail as the trigger module\nStep 2: Map the variables from Gmail in the Google Sheets module\nStep 3: Choose where to start\nStep 4: Test the scenario\nStep 5: Define the scenario schedule\nStep 6: Activate the scenario\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Learn how to modify it and make an HTTP request using an API key to connect to a third-party service. In this tutorial, we have used SendGrid and have shown how to do the following:\n\nConnect to SendGrid over HTTP\n\nSend an email using SendGrid directly from the HTTP module on Make\n\nSend an email using a template on SendGrid\n\nRelevant points to note\n\nSendGrid's authentication takes place using an API Key. Hence we use the 'Make a request' HTTP module on Make.\n\nTo send an email directly from the HTTP module, add the 'content' parameter to your JSON data structure. As you can see below, 'content' is an array of collections; 'type' and 'value' are where you need to define the content type and the actual content respectively. Also, it is a required parameter and will result in an error if left blank.\n\nTo send an email using a template, you need to add the 'template_id' parameter. As you can see in the image below, 'template_id' is a simple string and is an optional parameter and hence why it can be left blank.\n\nVideo tutorial\n\nNote: if the video is not working for you, open it directly in YouTube.\n\nHere's the link to the template used in this scenario and you can refer to the SendGrid API Docs here.\n\nPlease note that Make only supports V3 of the SendGrid API.\n\nIn this section\nRelevant points to note\nVideo tutorial\nUse JSON Generator to create a JSON Data Structure and make an HTTP request using an API Key (SendGrid example)\nRelevant points to note\nVideo tutorial\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

If you hover over items in the Google Sheets > Search Rows module's output, you can notice that the raw names of items are in fact zero based indexes:\n\nUsing the Repeater module to cycle from 0 to the number of columns minus 1 followed by a module employing the get(bundle;3. i) formula seems like a straightforward solution:\n\nThe only obstacle is that the first parameter of the get() function should be the whole bundle, which is currently not available in the mapping panel. Nevertheless, you can use the Array aggregator module to push the bundle into a single item array (by exploiting its grouping feature) to which the get() function can be applied:\n\nHere is the complete scenario:\n\nThe formula in the last module contains two nested get() functions. The inner function gets the whole bundle (first item in the single item array), the outer one returns the i-th column from the row.\n\nget(get(4. Array;1);3. i)\n\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

In the following guide, we will show you how to connect Airtable to Google Contacts and synchronize a list of contacts between these services.\n\nAdding Google Contacts\n\nGo to your dashboard and click Create a new scenario.\n\nSelect Google Contact and then Watch contacts module.\n\nIn the module, click Add to add a connection. A dialog pops up asking you to name your connection. You can enter whichever name you like. We recommend using names from which you can derive which Google account the connection relates to, in case you forget it. Your Google email or name is a good choice.\n\nClick Save. A window pops up asking you to select which Google account you want to use. Select the appropriate account and approve access for Make.\n\nAdding Airtable\n\nAdd a new module to the scenario, select Airtable and Create a record module.\n\nAdd a connection to Airtable in the same way you did with the Google Contacts module.\n\nAfter clicking the Add button, the system prompts you to enter your Airtable email, password, and API token.\n\nIn order to get your API token, head to https://airtable.com/account, scroll down a bit to find the API token field. If you haven't used Airtable's API before, you don't have an API token. But it is easy to generate one - just press the Generate token link and Airtable generates your API token. If you already have a token, there is no need to regenerate a new one.\n\nCopy your API token over to the API token field in Make and click Save.\n\nConfiguring the scenario\n\nAfter your Google and Airtable accounts have been linked to Make, you can continue setting up your scenario.\n\nIn Airtable, select a table that stores your contacts.\n\nThe same fields show in Make as in your table. In our example, there are only 3 fields: Name, Email, and Phone. When you click on the field, a number of options show on how to fill this field.\n\nFor the Name field, you can use Google Contacts' Full Name field. Since Google Contacts allows you to store multiple emails for a single contact, we will select only the first one.\n\nPress the Airtable Email field, then, in the newly opened dialog find the Emails[] field, click a little triangle to the right of Emails[], this will expand the Emails[] field, and click on Email.\n\nFill in the Airtable Phone field the same way.\n\nYour Airtable module configuration should now look like this:\n\nPress the Ok to save and close the configuration dialog.\n\nYour scenario should look like this:\n\nRun your scenario.\n\nIf you have some contacts in Google Contacts and if everything has been processed without errors, Watch contacts module generates some bundles. Also Create a record module successfully creates new records out of the bundles which the Watch contacts module generated.\n\nGo to your table and verify that the data is there.\n\nIn this section\nAdding Google Contacts\nAdding Airtable\nConfiguring the scenario\nHow to connect Airtable and Google contacts and synchronize contacts between these services\nAdding Google Contacts\nAdding Airtable\nConfiguring the scenario\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Notion’s popularity among Make users is increasing every day.\n\nStart with this guide to learn how to connect Notion with Make, and how to automate workflows using Notion database items, databases, and pages.\n\nWith the Notion modules in Make, you can:\n\nwatch newly created or updated database items and send their data to other apps.\n\nretrieve specific database items and use their data in your scenarios.\n\ncreate or update database items according to the data you get from other apps.\n\nwatch newly created or updated databases and pages to trigger a scenario.\n\ncreate or update databases according to data you get from previous modules.\n\nsearch and retrieve specific databases or pages to use in your scenario.\n\nwatch newly added or updated page content\n\nlist the existing content of a specific page.\n\nappend content to a page according to data from previous modules.\n\nIn this getting started guide, we will focus on the most common way to use Notion with Make; watching, creating, and updating database items.\n\nConnect Notion with Make\n\nYou must be a Workspace owner of your Notion workspace to connect it to Make. You can verify your access level on the Notion Settings screen, on the Members tab.\n\nINTERNAL VS. PUBLIC CONNECTION\n\nPublic Connection lets you use the Single Sign-on (SSO) with your Notion account. You will be able to select the pages you want Make to access. Whenever you want to add a new database or page to the Selected Pages that Make has access to, you will need to reauthorize the connection. Choose a public connection if you want Make to have access your whole workspace, or if you're not planning on adding more pages to the connection.\n\nInternal Connection lets you create your own integration from your Notion account and use an Integration Token to connect Notion to Make. To give Make access to your databases or pages, you will need to configure the integration of those pages manually in your Notion account. Whenever you want to add a new database or page, you will need to invite the integration account into that page from the Invite section. Choose an internal connection if you frequently add new pages that will be processed by your automation.\n\nPublic connection (SSO)\n\nAdd a Notion module into a scenario. Click Add next to the Connection field.\n\nSelect Notion Public from Connection Type. Give your connection a descriptive name, and then click Save.\n\nIn the dialog that appears, review the permissions you're giving to Make, then click Select pages.\n\nSelect pages that Make will have access to and then click Allow access.\n\nRetrieve newly added databases or pages\nInternal connection (Integration token)\n\nLog in to your Notion account.\n\nClick Settings & Members > My connections > Develop or manage integrations. Alternatively, go to https://www.notion.so/my-integrations to open the integration settings directly.\n\nClick Create a new integration.\n\nFill in the Basic information, select an Associated workspace, and review the integration's access settings.\n\nClick Save changes.\n\nCopy the Internal Integration Token to your clipboard.\n\nLog in to Make and add a module from Notion into a scenario.\n\nClick Add next to the Connection field.\n\nSelect Notion Internal under Connection type. Then enter a descriptive name for your connection.\n\nIn the Internal Integration Token field, enter the token you copied in step 6 and click Save.\n\nAdd Databases to be visible in Make\n\nFor the Notion internal connection, by default, Notion databases do not appear in the Database ID field > Search option. You must manually add them to the Make app from your Notion account.\n\nTo add databases from your Notion account to Make app:\n\nLog in to your Notion account.\n\nEnter into the database you want to add to Make , click on ... in the top right corner, click Add connections, search for and click on the integration you previously created, and click Confirm.\n\nThe database is successfully shared and you can now see it in a module's Database ID > Search field.\n\nWatch database items\n\nThe Watch database items module triggers your scenario when someone creates or updates a database in Notion.\n\nYou have two options; watch database items ‘by created time’ or ‘by updated time’.\n\nBy created time: If want to trigger the scenario only with new database items but not with updated items.\n\nBy updated time: If you want to trigger the scenario both with new items and updated items.\n\nFind the Database ID\n\nThe database that you want to use should have been created before you start automating. To find the database ID, you can check out the URL of the Notion page or you can use the Search function in Make modules:\n\nDatabase ID in the URL: Database ID is the part of the URL between the first '/' and '?'.\n\nSearch by query: Click on the ‘Search’ button, enter the name of the database and click ‘OK’. The database ID will be filled automatically.\n\nNote: If you are creating a new database, check out Retrieve newly added databases or pages\n\nCreate database items\n\nThe Create a Database item module allows you to create new items in an existing database.\n\nYou have two options to enter the database ID and to map the values of the new database items:\n\nSelect from the list (Recommended): lets you find the database ID with a query and automatically shows the list of fields available for mapping. Note: if the fields do not show up, try saving the module by clicking ‘OK’ and opening it again to load the database fields.\n\nEnter manually: lets you enter the database ID manually and map the details of the fields manually by selecting Key, Value Type, Value groups. For more information, see the property schema objects.\n\nUpdate database items\n\nThe Update a Database Item module allows you to update an existing database item.\n\nSimilar to the \"Create a Database Item\" module, this module offers \"Select from list\" or \"Enter Manually\". We recommend using the \"Select from the list\" option for its simplicity.\n\nSelect from the list (Recommended): Click ‘Search’ and enter the name of the database, then click OK. The Database ID is automatically populated with the ID of the selected database. Click on the Database Item ID field to map this ID from previous modules (e.g., Watch Database Items). Then select the field you want to update, either by manually entering a value or by mapping values from previous modules.\n\nUse case: Sync Notion events database with Google Calendar\n\nOne of the most popular use cases for Notion is syncing a database with Google Calendar to help you track your calendar events in one place. To better understand this use case and to show how to use Make to implement it, we will break down a ready-to-use template; Create Google Calendar events from Notion Database Items.\n\nThis scenario watches database items by updated time. When new database item data arrives, the scenario checks if they are new items, existing items, or deleted/canceled items. Then, the scenario either creates a new Google Calendar event, updates an existing event, or deletes an existing event.\n\nTo use this template or to create this use case from scratch, the Notion database that stores the events needs to have these properties:\n\nTitle: text field\n\nStatus: select the field with two options; “Scheduled” and “Cancelled”\n\nEvent ID: text field that will store Google Calendar event IDs\n\nMeeting Time: date field that will store the start and end times of the meetings\n\nIf you prefer to use an empty Notion database with these properties, you can duplicate this example database into your Notion account.\n\nNote: This template expects the user to manually change the status of the event in Notion; “Scheduled” or “Cancelled” to create or delete events in Google Calendar.\n\nNote: If you decide to use the template itself, make sure the setup is matching the screenshots in this guide. There might be some parts where you need to change the Mapping switch or add field mappings by yourself.\n\nSTEP 1 - WATCH DATABASE ITEMS\n\nStart with the first module, which is the trigger module: Watch Database Items.\n\nAfter you connect your Notion account, find the database ID of the Notion database which stores your events. Set up the scenario to watch database items ‘By updated time’. You want to trigger this scenario any time an event is updated, not only when an event is created.\n\nSTEP 2 - ROUTER\n\nThe Router module with 3 routes allows you to perform 3 different actions depending on filter conditions.\n\nFirst route (New event) checks if the event is a newly created event (meaning the event doesn’t exist in Google Calendar yet). The filter in this route checks if the Event ID is empty (null) and if the status of the event is “Scheduled”.\n\nSecond route (Updated event) checks if the event was already created on Google Calendar (Event ID is not null) and if the status of the event is “Scheduled” (meaning it was not canceled).\n\nThird route (Deleted event) checks if the event exists on Google Calendar (Event ID is not null) and if the status of the event is “Cancelled”.\n\nSTEP 3 - GOOGLE CALENDAR MODULES\n\nGoogle Calendar modules create, update or delete events.\n\nCreate an Event (first route); creates a new event by mapping the title, start date and end date.\n\nSince this is the route that handles a new Google Calendar event, add a Notion module at the end to reference the Google Calendar Event ID in the Notion database.\n\nUpdate an Event (second route): Finds the Google Calendar event by Event ID and updates the Google Calendar event details (title, start date, end date) for it to reflect the changes in Notion database.\n\nDelete an Event (third route): finds the Google Calendar event by Event ID and deleted it.\n\nUse the additional Notion module at the end to remove the Event ID from the Notion database and add a note saying that the event was deleted.\n\nTEST AND SCHEDULE THE SCENARIO\n\nOnce the scenario is complete, you can test if it works as expected.\n\nRight-click Watch Database Items module and select Choose where to start.\n\nYou can choose ‘From now on’ or ‘Since specific date’ to trigger the scenario with a new event.\n\nClick Run once and see if the data bundles were transferred as shown below.\n\nIn this section\nConnect Notion with Make\nWatch database items\nCreate database items\nUpdate database items\nUse case: Sync Notion events database with Google Calendar\nUsing Notion with Make\nConnect Notion with Make\nPublic connection (SSO)\nRetrieve newly added databases or pages\nInternal connection (Integration token)\nAdd Databases to be visible in Make\nWatch database items\nFind the Database ID\nCreate database items\nUpdate database items\nUse case: Sync Notion events database with Google Calendar\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Airtable is a low-code platform for creating and sharing relational databases. You can use Airtable to store your data as you would in a spreadsheet like Google sheets. Airtable can store data about your contacts, appointments, or tasks.\n\nThe difference between Airtable and a spreadsheet is that Airtable can accommodate high data traffic and you can connect data in multiple tables to form logical relations between them.\n\nThis tutorial guides you through the steps to set up Airtable to work with Make. We will cover the following use cases:\n\nTrigger a scenario by creating or modifying records in Airtable.\n\nCreate or update a record in Airtable with data from another app.\n\nUse case 1: Trigger a scenario by creating or modifying records in Airtable\n\nIn this workflow, imagine that we’re working at an NGO company and we use Airtable to manage several projects. Some of those projects require external collaboration. We will use Asana to coordinate with collaborators outside of our firm. Make will help us organize and sync up with our imaginary external collaborators.\n\nSteps to follow:\n\nChoose a trigger module\n\nConfigure the trigger module\n\nCreate a new task in Asana\n\nTest and schedule your scenario\n\nChoose a trigger module\n\nThe first step in any automation is choosing what will kick off the process. In Make, the first component of your scenario is a trigger module.\n\nThe trigger module for our scenario is the Airtable Watch Records module. The Watch Records module checks the Created Time field in your table for new records. If the module finds a new record, it retrieves the record data.\n\nThis Make integration allows you to transfer information from Airtable to Asana automatically:\n\nSkip this step if you already have the Airtable database that you want to use. Create a new database in Airtable. Check out the official Airtable help for tips on how to navigate in Airtable.\n\nSkip this step if you have an appropriate table in your Airtable database already. Create a new table in your Airtable database.\n\nNote\n\nYour table has to have a field with the field type set to Created time. This field contains the timestamp of the moment when the record was created. You can set any label to the field.\n\nNavigate to the Make Scenario editor.\n\nClick the big plus icon. At the bottom of the pop-up window use the search field to find the \"Airtable\" app.\n\nClick on the Airtable app field. In the next selection, choose the Watch Records module.\n\nYou have added the Airtable Watch Records module. This module acts as the trigger module in your scenario.\n\nConfigure the trigger module\n\nThe trigger module Watch Records checks your table for new records. If the module finds a new record it retrieves the record data.\n\nChoose your Airtable connection in the Connection drop-down field.\n\nIf you don't have an Airtable connection set up, refer to the Connect Airtable to Make page.\n\nIn the Base field, choose your Airtable database. In the Table drop-down, select the table that contains the Created Time field. In the View drop-down field, leave the default Grid view.\n\nIn the Trigger Field drop-down, select the table field with the type Created Time .\n\nChoose the Label field. The Label field value should identify the record for you. Choose a descriptive field for the Label. For example, the task name.\n\nYou have set up the trigger module for your synchronization scenario.\n\nCreate a new task in Asana\n\nAsana is a team and project management web application. In this guide, you will use the Asana Create a Task or Subtask module to create new tasks using data from your Airtable database. All of this will happen automatically, every time you add a new record to Airtable.\n\nHover over the Watch Records module and click Add another module. Add the Asana Create a Task or Subtask module to your scenario.\n\nIn the module settings Connection field, choose your Asana connection. If you don't have an Asana connection yet follow this guide.\n\nIn the Task destination drop-down field, select Projects and Sections. In the Workspace ID field, choose your Asana workspace.\n\nIn the Project and sections field, click Add item. Choose the project and section name in the Project ID and Project Section ID drop-down fields.\n\nMap the task Name from Airtable to the Task Name field. Read more about mapping.\n\nWhen you run the scenario, the task in Asana will have the same name as in Airtable.\n\nYou have setup the Asana Create a Task or a Subtask module. This module automatically transfers data from your Airtable database to your Asana project.\n\nTest and schedule your scenario\n\nWhen you are finished with designing a scenario, you should test it. Make enables you to just run the scenario once and see if it works. If the scenario works the way you imagined, you can schedule the scenario to run automatically. Read more about scheduling a scenario.\n\nWhen you start the scenario manually to test it, the scenario waits for data. This happens because we use a watch module as the scenario trigger. That means you have to create a test record in your Airtable database after you execute the scenario.\n\nFollow these steps to test the scenario:\n\nClick the Run once button run to execute the scenario. The Watch Records module now waits for new data.\n\nCreate a new record in the Airtable database.\n\nCheck your waiting scenario. If everything went well, the scenario should have already finished. When the scenario finishes, the Run Once button is active again and the modules in the scenario have bubbles with numbers above them.\n\nCheck your Asana project board. There should be a new task created based on the data you added to your Airtable database.\n\nAfter successful testing you can turn on the scenario scheduling with the Scheduling On/Off button and set how often should Make execute the scenario. Read more about scenario scheduling.\n\nUse case 2: Create or update a record in Airtable with data from another app\n\nIn the next example, we will create a workflow that stores booking information to Airtable when a new event is created in Calendly. Calendly is a scheduling platform that simplifies scheduling meetings between different organizations. You can read more about Calendly on the Calendly homepage.\n\nYour database in Airtable will have two tables: Contacts and Touchpoints. The Contacts table will contain information about the people you meet. The Toupoints table will contain information about your meetings. Together, these tables will form a relational database.\n\nThe scenario workflow consists of these steps:\n\nSet up the trigger module\n\nGet event info\n\nRead data from Airtable\n\nSplit the scenario flow with the Router module\n\nCreate a new contact\n\nCreate a new touchpoint\n\nTest and schedule your scenario\n\nYou can use this scenario as part of your process to manage appointments with your clients.\n\nSet up the trigger module\n\nThe trigger module is the first module in the scenario flow. The trigger module starts according to the scenario scheduling. The next modules in the scenario flow use the output data from the trigger module.\n\nYou will set up the Calendly Watch events module. This module retrieves the Calendly event identification link for every new or updated Calendly event.\n\nNote\n\nCalendly creates an event after you invite at least one participant to the event.\n\nNote\n\nYou will need to have the Calendly account plan Professional or higher to be able to connect it with Make. Check the Calendly pricing page.\n\nClick Create a new scenario in your Make account dashboard.\n\nClick the big plus icon. At the bottom of the pop-up window use the search field to find the \"Calendly\" app.\n\nClick on the Calendly app field. In the next selection, choose the Watch Events module.\n\nClick the Add button to add a webhook to the Watch events module. The Watch Events module needs a webhook to trigger every time when an appointment is added or modified. Read more about triggers.\n\nNote\n\nThe blue lightning icon on top of the Calendly app indicates that this module is an instant trigger.\n\nIn the next pop-up window fill in the Webhook name and choose a Calendly connection. If don't have a Calendly connection follow the steps in the Connecting Calendly to Make section.\n\nFill in the rest of the Watch Events webhook settings.\n\nCheck the events you want to watch in the Events selection box.\n\nIn the drop-down Enter an Organization and User URI, choose the Select from the list option.\n\nIn the Organization URI drop-down, select your organization.\n\nin the User URI drop-down, select your user name.\n\nClick the Save button to finish the webhook settings. Click the OK button to confirm the settings of the Watch Events module.\n\nYou have set up the Calendly Watch Events trigger module. This module watches events in your Calendly account to keep your CRM up to date.\n\nScenario progress:\n\nGet event info\n\nThe next module in the scenario workflow is the Calendly module Get an Event. This module retrieves additional information about an event, such as the start time and end time of the event, and contact information of the event participants.\n\nThe trigger module outputs the event link. You will use this link in the Get an Event module.\n\nHover over the Watch events module and click Add another module.\n\nChoose Calendly app and then Get an Event module.\n\nin the module settings Connection field, choose your Calendly connection.\n\nMap the Event variable to the Event field.\n\nYou can read more about mapping on the Mapping page.\n\nClick the OK button to save the module settings.\n\nYou have set up the Calendly Get an event module. The Get an event module retrieves information about an event. You will store the additional information in Airtable in the following steps.\n\nScenario progress:\n\nRead data from Airtable\n\nNow we can start working with the Airtable app. The next steps guide you through creating a new database in Airtable. The database will store data about your contacts and meetings.\n\nNext, you add the first Airtable app module to your scenario. The Airtable app module Search Records reads data from a table, then outputs the data that fit the search criteria.\n\nYou will use data output from this module to determine whether the meeting is with a new contact, or with a contact that you already have.\n\nNote\n\nThis guide suggests a specific Airtable database and table layout. If you want to use your already existing database adapt the steps accordingly.\n\nCreate a new database in Airtable called Meetings. Check out the official Airtable help for tips on how to navigate in Airtable.\n\nSetup the Contacts and Touchpoints tables in Airtable.\n\nThe Contacts table with the columns:\n\nField name\n\n\t\n\nField type\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\t\n\nSingle line text\n\n\t\n\nThe contact email\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\t\n\nSingle line text\n\n\t\n\nThe contact name\n\n\n\n\nTouchpoints\n\n\t\n\nLinked field\n\n\t\n\nDisplays data from the Touchpoints table\n\nThe Touchpoints table with the columns:\n\nField name\n\n\t\n\nField type\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nEvent name\n\n\t\n\nSingle line text\n\n\t\n\nThe name of the event\n\n\n\n\nStart time\n\n\t\n\nDate\n\n\t\n\nDate and time when the event starts\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\n\t\n\nSingle select\n\n\t\n\nThe source of the event\n\n\n\n\nContacts\n\n\t\n\nLinked field\n\n\t\n\nDisplays the corresponding contact name from the Contacts table\n\nAdd the Airtable app module Search Records to the scenario.\n\nIn the Connection drop-down field, choose your Airtable connection. If you don't have an Airtable connection set up, refer to the Connect Airtable to Make page.\n\nIn the Base drop-down, choose the Meetings database. In the Table drop-down field, choose the Contacts table. Select the default Grid view in the View drop-down field.\n\nFill in the Formula field as in the screenshot. The {Email} is the name of the field in the Contacts table, and the variable in the quotation marks is mapped from the output of the Watch Events module.\n\nClick the OK button to confirm the module settings.\n\nYou have set up the Airtable Search Records module. The Search Records module reads data in the Airtable Contacts table. We will process the data in the next steps.\n\nScenario progress:\n\nSplit the scenario flow with the Router module\n\nThe Router module divides the data flow through your scenario into multiple paths -- routes. Router sends each piece of data it receives to each route. The routes are processed one by one in the same order that they were connected to the Router.\n\nRead more about Router and scenario data flow in Make.\n\nWe will design the Router routes so that the first route creates a new contact and a new Calendly event with the new contact. The second route will create just a new event with an existing contact.\n\nWe will use the data output from the Search Records module to decide which route will be active.\n\nAdd the Router module to the scenario flow. It will create two new routes for you.\n\nNote\n\nYou can add more routes by clicking the Router module.\n\nClick the top dotted line from the router to the new module. A filter pop-up form appears.\n\nFill in the label for the filter. We will label the filter as New contact.\n\nSet the filter condition to the Total number of bundles of the Airtable Search records module. In the operator drop-down, select Numeric operators: Equal to. Fill in zero in the last text field.\n\nClick the OK button to confirm the filter settings.\n\nYou have added a Router module and set up a Filter to the first split route to create a new contact. If the contact mail is not found in the Contacts table, a new contact will be created.\n\nScenario progress:\n\nCreate a new contact\n\nIn this step, we will work on the first route from the Router module. We will add the Airtable Create a record module to create a new contact in the Contacts table if the meeting contact is not in the Contacts table.\n\nAdd the Airtable Create a Record module instead of the plus in the top scenario route.\n\nRight-click the Create a Record module. Choose the Rename action in the menu. Rename the module to Create a contact.\n\nIn the Connection drop-down, sSelect your Airtable connection. in the Base drop-down, select the Meetings database. In the Table drop-down field, select the Contacts table.\n\nMap the Email and Name variables from the Watch Events module to the Email and Name fields:\n\nClick the OK button to confirm the module settings.\n\nYou have set up the Airtable Create a contact module. The Create a contact module creates a new record in the Contacts table when you create a new event with a contact that is not recorded in the Contacts table.\n\nScenario progress:\n\nCreate a new touchpoint\n\nIn this step you will use the Airtable Create a record module to create new meetings in the Touchpoints table. You will then clone the module to use it in both of the scenario routes.\n\nAdd the Airtable Create a Record module after the Create a contact module.\n\nIn the Connection drop-down, select your Airtable connection. In the Base drop-down, choose the Meetings database. In the Table drop-down field select the Touchpoints table.\n\nMap the output of the previous modules to the Create a Record module input:\n\nMap the Name value to the Event name field.\n\nMap the Start time value to the Start time field.\n\nMap the ID value from the Create a contact module to the Contacts > Record ID 1 field.\n\nClick the OK button to confirm the module settings.\n\nRight-click the Create a Record module. Choose the Rename action in the menu. Rename the module to Create a touchpoint.\n\nRight-click the Create a touchpoint module and choose Clone in the actions menu. Another Create a touchpoint module pops out that is the exact copy of the original Create a touchpoint module.\n\nConnect the cloned module to the Router module. That way, you create a new route in the scenario flow.\n\nCheck the cloned Create a touchpoint module settings. Update the Contact > Record ID 1 mapping to use the ID variable from the Search Records module. Click the OK button to save the updated module settings.\n\nClick the dotted line that connects the Router module and the cloned Create a touchpoint module to create a filter. A form to set up a filter pops up:\n\nFill in the filter Label.\n\nSet the filter condition to the Total number of bundles of the Airtable Search records module.\n\nSelect Numeric operators: Not equal to in the operator drop-down.\n\nFill in zero in the last text field.\n\nYou have setup the Create a touchpoint modules. The Create a touchpoint modules create a new record in the Touchpoints table when you create a new event in Calendly.\n\nScenario progress:\n\nTest and schedule your scenario\n\nWhen you are finished with designing a scenario, you should test it. Make enables you to just run the scenario once and see if it works. If the scenario works the way you imagined, you can schedule the scenario to run automatically. Read more about scheduling a scenario.\n\nWhen you start the scenario manually to test it, the scenario waits for data. This happens because we use a watch module as the scenario trigger. That means you have to create the test event in Calendly after you execute the scenario.\n\nFollow these steps to test the scenario:\n\nClick the Run once button to execute the scenario. The Watch Events module now waits for new data.\n\nSchedule a new event in Calendly. Check the Calendly help on how to create a new event.\n\nCheck your waiting scenario. If everything went well, the scenario should have already finished. When the scenario finishes, the Run Once button is active again and the modules in the scenario have bubbles with numbers above them.\n\nCheck the tables in your Meetings Airtable database. They should contain the data you provided in the event you created in Calendly.\n\nAfter successful testing you can turn on the scenario scheduling with the Scheduling On/Off slider and set how often should Make execute the scenario. Read more about scenario scheduling.\n\nUse case 2: Create or update a record in Airtable with data from another app -- advanced\n\nThis guide builds on top of the guide in the previous section. The following points improve on the previous use case.\n\nWhen you store information about a meeting, you might need information about the meeting duration. Also, in the previous workflow, you clone the Create a touchpoint module. This makes the scenario harder to maintain because if you change something in the Touchpoints table, you have to update two modules.\n\nThis improved workflow adds information about the duration of the meeting to the Touchpoints table and prevents module duplication.\n\nTo do that, this tutorial uses some of the advanced Make features.\n\nRemove module duplication\n\nYou have created a clone of the Create a touchpoint module in the previous workflow. This approach is fast but has the downside of checking and maintaining two almost identical modules, which is error-prone.\n\nWhen you create a contact in the Contacts table, the Create a contact module outputs the ID of the new contact. This is the only information that you need to transfer to the second scenario route where you create a new touchpoint.\n\nInstead of having another Create a touchpoint module, you can store the ID value in a variable with the Set variable module and retrieve it with the Get variable module.\n\nThe following steps describe how to change the scenario design to avoid having two duplicate modules:\n\nIn the top Router path, remove the Create a touchpoint module. After the Create a contact module, add the Set variable module.\n\nFill in the Variable name. For example new-contact-ID. Set the Variable lifetime to One execution. Map the Variable value to the ID value output from the Create a contact module.\n\nClick the OK button to confirm the module settings.\n\nRemove the filter in the bottom scenario route. The bottom scenario route will be always active in the new scenario design.\n\nRight-click the dotted line between the Router and Create a touchpoint modules. Choose Add a module from the actions menu. Select the Get variable module.\n\nFill in the same variable name in the Variable name field as you used in the Set variable module.\n\nChange the mapping in the Create a touchpoint module in the Contacts > Record ID 1 field. Map the Record ID 1 field to ID OR new-contact-ID.\n\nCaution\n\nPick the OR operator from the General functions > Logical operators menu.\n\nThe mapping relies on the fact, that one of the variables is always empty -- either the ID or the new-contact-ID. Which variable holds the empty value depends on whether the scenario creates a new contact or not.\n\nYou have removed the duplicate Create a touchpoint module. Instead, you are using the Set variable and Get variable modules to store and retrieve the ID value of the new contact in the Contacts table.\n\nScenario progress:\n\nEdit the Touchpoints table\n\nThe next step is to add the meeting duration to the Touchpoints table. Add the Duration [minutes] column to the Touchpoints table in your Meetings Airtable database.\n\nThe updated Touchpoints table will have the columns:\n\nField name\n\n\t\n\nField type\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nEvent name\n\n\t\n\nSingle line text\n\n\t\n\nThe name of the event\n\n\n\n\nStart time\n\n\t\n\nDate\n\n\t\n\nDate and time when the event starts\n\n\n\n\nDuration [minutes]\n\n\t\n\nNumber\n\n\t\n\nDuration of the event in minutes\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\n\t\n\nSingle select\n\n\t\n\nThe source of the event\n\n\n\n\nContacts\n\n\t\n\nLinked field\n\n\t\n\nDisplays the corresponding contact name from the \"Contacts\" table\n\nAnd will look like this:\n\nCalculate the meeting duration\n\nYour Touchpoints table already contains the Start time of the meetings. The duration of the meeting is the information that would give you the whole picture of the event. However, Calendly Get an Event module returns only the Start time and End time values. You can use Make to calculate the event duration from those values.\n\nThe Get an Event module returns the Start time and End time values in the Date data type. You cannot subtract directly two Date values. You have to convert the Date to a Number. You can do that with the formatDate function.\n\nRead more about the data types and Date and time functions in Make.\n\nClick the Create a touchpoint module to open the module settings. Scroll the module settings to the Duration [minutes] field.\n\nFill in the formula in the Duration [minutes] field:\n\nGo to General functions tab and insert a pair of parentheses (). This is required because just writing parentheses in the mapping field won't work.\n\nInsert the formatDate function from the Date and time functions tab in the parentheses. Map the End time value from the Get an Event module as the first argument of the formatDate function. Fill in X as the second argument. This converts the Date value to a UNIX timestamp.\n\nInsert the - (minus) sign from the Math functions tab after the formatDate function. Insert another formatDate function next to the minus sign. Map the Start time value from the Get an Event module as the first argument of the formatDate function. Fill in X as the second argument.\n\nSo far, the result of the formula would give you the duration of the event in seconds. To convert seconds to minutes, move your cursor out of the parentheses and insert the division operator / from the Math functions tab after the parentheses.\n\nInsert 60 after the division operator to convert seconds to minutes.\n\nThe final formula should look like this:\n\nThe scenario now inserts the meeting duration into the Touchpoints table.\n\nIn this section\nUse case 1: Trigger a scenario by creating or modifying records in Airtable\nUse case 2: Create or update a record in Airtable with data from another app\nUse case 2: Create or update a record in Airtable with data from another app -- advanced\nUsing Airtable with Make\nUse case 1: Trigger a scenario by creating or modifying records in Airtable\nChoose a trigger module\nConfigure the trigger module\nCreate a new task in Asana\nTest and schedule your scenario\nUse case 2: Create or update a record in Airtable with data from another app\nSet up the trigger module\nGet event info\nRead data from Airtable\nSplit the scenario flow with the Router module\nCreate a new contact\nCreate a new touchpoint\nTest and schedule your scenario\nUse case 2: Create or update a record in Airtable with data from another app -- advanced\nRemove module duplication\nEdit the Touchpoints table\nCalculate the meeting duration\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

It will also show you where you can find information about your processed data and how to read it.\n\nOnce a scenario is set-up correctly and activated, it will execute according to its defined schedule.\n\nThe scenario begins with the first module responding to an event it has been set to watch for. If it returns any bundles (data), the bundles are then passed on to the next module and the scenario continues. If it does not return any modules, the scenario does not continue and ends after the first module. In the case where there are returned bundles after the first module, the bundles will then go through each proceeding module one-by-one. If the bundles are processed correctly throughout all of the modules, the scenario is then marked as Successful.\n\nExample: Connecting Facebook to Dropbox\n\nThe example below shows how Make connects three modules in a scenario. It explains how Make downloads photos from Facebook, converts them to another format, and sends them to a selected Dropbox folder.\n\nWhen the scenario begins, the first step is to watch for bundles. In this case, it is to watch for photos on Facebook. If it does not return a bundle (a photo), the processing of the scenario does not continue and ends after the first module.\n\nIf a bundle is returned, the bundle then passes through the rest of the scenario. The bundle is first recieved through the Watch photos module, then it goes through the Convert a format module for the Image app, and then goes through the Upload a file module for Dropbox to reach its final destination, the Dropbox folder.\n\nIt is also important to note that if Facebook returns multiple bundles, for example two bundles, the processing of the latter bundle will not start until the first bundle is converted and uploaded to Dropbox.\n\nInformation about processed bundles\n\nFor each module, the bundle goes through a 4 step process before going on to the next module or reaching its final destination. The 4 step process is Initalization, Operation, Commit/Rollback, and Finalization. This is called transaction processing and it helps to explain how data was processed in a module.\n\nOnce a scenario run is complete, each module displays an icon showing the number of operations performed. Clicking this icon will display the detailed information about the processed bundles, in the format described above. You can see which modules settings were used and which bundles were returned by which module.\n\nThe picture beside illustrates the processing of the last module used in the scenario above, the Dropbox module, Upload a file.\n\nThe module received the following input information:\n\nConverted image\n\nSelected folder where the image shall be uploaded to\n\nOriginal name of the Facebook image\n\nAfter processing, the module returned this output information:\n\nImage ID assigned by Dropbox\n\nFull path where in Dropbox Make uploaded the file\n\nThe above information is captured for each bundle separately, as marked by the drop down boxes Operation 1 and Operation 2 in the image.\n\nError occurred while executing a scenario\n\nAn error may occur during the scenario run. For example, if you delete the Dropbox folder that you have set as the target folder in the module setting, the scenario will terminate with an error message. For more information on this and to learn how to handle errors, please see the Error processing help guide.\n\nIn this section\nExample: Connecting Facebook to Dropbox\nInformation about processed bundles\nError occurred while executing a scenario\nScenario execution flow\nExample: Connecting Facebook to Dropbox\nInformation about processed bundles\nError occurred while executing a scenario\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

They are also checked if each module is capable of performing their intended operation(s).\n\nCycles\n\nEach cycle represents an undividable unit of work composed of a series of operations. It is possible to set the maximum number of cycles in the scenario settings. The default number is 1.\n\nOperation\n\nDuring the operation phase reading and/or writing operation is performed:\n\nThe reading operation consists of obtaining data from a service that will then be processed by other modules according to a predefined scenario. E.g. the Dropbox > Watch files module returns new bundles (files) created since the last scenario execution.\n\nThe writing operation consists of sending data to a given service for further processing. E.g. the Dropbox > Upload a file module uploads a file to a Dropbox folder.\n\nCommit\n\nIf the operation phase is successful for all modules, the commit phase begins during which all operations performed by the modules are committed. This means that Make sends information to all the services involved in the operation phase about its success.\n\nRollback\n\nIf an error occurs during the operation or commit phase on any module, the phase is aborted and the rollback phase is started, making all operations during the given cycle void. Some modules do not support rollback and operations performed by these modules cannot be taken back. For more information see the ACID modules section.\n\nFinalization\n\nDuring the finalization phase, open connections (e.g. FTP connections, database connections, etc.) are closed and the scenario is completed.\n\nACID modules\n\nThe modules that support rollback (transactional modules) are tagged with the ACID tag:\n\nThe modules not tagged with this tag do not support rollback and cannot be reverted back to their initial state in case of an error in other modules.\n\nA typical example is the Email Send an email module. Once the module sends an email during its operation phase, the sending cannot be undone.\n\nExamples\n\nTransfer of bundles between databases\n\nThe following example shows how to connect three ACID modules. The aim of the below scenario is to get new rows from a MySQL database, insert (transfer) them into a MSSQL database and then insert the IDs of the rows from the MSSQL database into a PostgreSQL database.\n\nWhen the scenario starts, the initialization phase is performed first. Make verifies connections to the MySQL, MSSQL and PostgreSQL databases one at a time. If everything goes well and the connections are successful, Make moves on to the operation phase. If an error occurs, the finalization phase starts instead of the operation phase and the scenario is terminated.\n\nNext comes the operation phase. A preset procedure selects (reads) the table rows (bundles) from MySQL. Those rows are then passed to the next module that writes them to a selected table in the MSSQL database. If everything is in order, the last PostgresSQL procedure is called to insert the row IDs returned by the preceding module into the table.\n\nIf the operation phase is completed successfully, the commit phase begins. Make calls the SQL COMMIT command for each database and the write operations will be committed.\n\nHowever, if the operation or commit phase fails due to an error, (e.g. connection failure), Make calls rollback. During the rollback phase, Make goes through all modules one after another and executes the SQL ROLLBACK command for each module to revert each database back to its initial state.\n\nFinally, during the finalization phase, each module will close its connection to the database.\n\nIn this section\nInitialization\nCycles\nOperation\nCommit\nRollback\nFinalization\nACID modules\nExamples\nScenario execution, cycles, and phases\nInitialization\nCycles\nOperation\nCommit\nRollback\nFinalization\nACID modules\nExamples\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Scenario inputs are not available on the Legacy plan.\n\nSee Make pricing for more information.\n\nThe scenario inputs feature allows everyone to run complex scenarios by just filling in the required scenario inputs.\n\nScenario inputs allow you to pass data with a predefined structure to a scenario every time you run it. First, you define the expected data structure. Then, whenever you run the scenario, Make shows a form where you enter the data. The data from your scenario input is then made available to all modules in the scenario.\n\nImagine a new employee is about to start working in your company. You may need to create new accounts for your new employee in several different systems (e.g. JIRA, Slack, Email, Miro, etc). To create these accounts, you need the new employee’s name, email, employee ID, and maybe some other personal information. Without this data, you cannot proceed with the account creation. Once you have all the necessary information, you can start setting up the accounts for the new employee.\n\nTo automate this action, you can set up a scenario that will create new accounts for your new employee in all the different systems you need. Use the scenario inputs feature to define the input structure as the starting point of your scenario. You can use the name, email, and employee ID as your scenario inputs. Once you enter and save the employee information to the scenario, the scenario runs and makes all the accounts so your new employee is good to go! The scenario cannot proceed unless it has all the data you define as required.\n\nMoreover, you don't need to know all the complex scenario logic behind it and how the accounts are created in different systems. A Make expert can pre-build the scenario(s) for you. All you need to do is just enter the required inputs (name, email, employee ID) and the scenario will run. In this way, even casual users can run complex automation using scenario inputs.\n\nSome other cases in which you might use scenario inputs:\n\nSyncing information about a new customer in multiple systems\n\nAdding offline leads to the CRM, email lists, and creating a proposal\n\nCreating a new record/invoice/email/order by just providing a set of inputs\n\nWatch the video\nDefine the scenario input structure\nNote\n\nScenario inputs are available on Pro, Teams, and Enterprise pricing plans.

A scenario comprises of a series of modules that indicate how data should be transferred and transformed between apps/services.\n\nThere are 4 steps to creating a scenario:\n\nChoose your apps\n\nBuild your scenario\n\nTest your scenario\n\nActivate your scenario\n\nExample: Add new incoming emails to a Google Sheet as a new row\n\nTo exemplify how to create a scenario, we will go through the process step-by-step. In our example scenario, we are adding new incoming emails to a Google Sheets spreadsheet as a new row.\n\nNote\n\nBefore you begin creating any scenario, ensure you are signed in to your Make account.\n\nStep 1: Choose your apps\n\nGo to your organization dashboard and click Create a new scenario button.\n\nYou can also go to Scenarios > Create a new scenario .\n\nClick the plus icon. A list of apps appears. In the search field, search for the app you want to use. In this case, search for Email.\n\nStep 2: Build your scenario\nAdd Email module\n\nSelect the folder whose emails you want to watch.\n\nGo to Scenarios > Create a new scenario\n\nAdd Email > Watch email module.\n\nCreate a connection to your email.\n\nSelect the folder whose emails you want to watch.\n\nSelect the criteria of the emails you want to watch from the dropdown menu.\n\n(optional)\n\nSpecify if you want to watch emails from a specific email address, emails that contain a specific phrase, etc.\n\nClick OK to save.\n\nA pop-up appears. Choose from when to want to start watching emails.\n\nClick OK to save.\n\nAdd Google Sheets > Add a row module\n\nHover over the right part of the Email module. The plus sign appears.\n\nClick Add another module. An empty module appears.\n\nSearch for and click the module you want. In this case, select Google Sheets > Add a row module.\n\nCreate a connection to your Google account.\n\nUnder Choose a method, select whether you want to select your spreadsheet from the list or manually.\n\nUnder Choose a Drive, select your drive.\n\nIn Spreadsheet ID, select your spreadsheet.\n\nIf your spreadsheet is in the folder, first select the folder. Then, click the plus sign to select the specific spreadsheet in the folder.\n\nSelect the sheet name.\n\nSelect whether your table contains headers.

More modules and more bundles being processed in a scenario mean a higher number of operations. The amount charged for your scenarios depends on how complex your scenarios are. This means that you'll want to choose a subscription that best fits your needs.\n\nHow to count the number of operations\n\nEvery time a module in a scenario performs an action, it counts as one operation.\n\nThe first module in a scenario runs only once and it always counts as one operation (even if it does not return a bundle). The number of times the rest of the modules run depends on the number of bundles they must process (one run of a module per one bundle). An exception is the aggregator module, which is counted as one operation per set of bundles being processed.\n\nNote\n\nThere are a few exceptions of modules when Make does not count the operations.\n\nError handler modules (Rollback, Break, Resume, Commit, Ignore)\n\nRouter module\n\nThe Sleep module consumes operations but does not consume data.\n\nExample: Connecting Instagram to Dropbox\n\nThe following scenario connects Instagram, Image, and Dropbox package modules. It shows how to download images from a selected Instagram account, resize them, and upload them to a selected Dropbox folder.\n\nOnce the execution of a scenario is completed, Make displays the number of operations performed by each module in the little white circle above the module.\n\nIn the above example, the Instagram module returned three photos and performed one operation. Each of the three photos then passed through the Image Resize module. Three more operations were needed to resize them. Finally, each photo was uploaded to the Dropbox folder. In order to upload three different photos, the module had to run three times (i.e., three more operations). The execution of this scenario required seven operations in total (1 + 3 + 3).\n\nMake's Operations vs. Zapier's Tasks\nMake\n\nThe trigger and search modules always perform one operation (even if more than one bundle is received).\n\nEach action module usually performs one or more operations, although there are exceptions.\n\nIf you want to calculate the total number of operations needed for the scenario, you can count approximately one operation for one step (module) in the scenario.\n\nZapier\n\nZapier's triggers do not perform any chargeable task.\n\nZapier's actions perform the task(s) that you are charged for.\n\nIn this section\nHow to count the number of operations\nMake's Operations vs. Zapier's Tasks\nCounting the number of operations\nHow to count the number of operations\nExample: Connecting Instagram to Dropbox\nMake's Operations vs. Zapier's Tasks\nMake\nZapier\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Why inactivate?\n\nThere are specific purposes for activating your scenarios as well as other reasons for making your scenarios inactive.\n\nUsing the example of connecting Instagram to Dropbox, you want to activate your scenario when you are wanting to consistently watch your account on a long-term basis. In this case, whenever you add a photo, it will automatically upload this photo to Dropbox. It will do so according to its schedule.\n\nOn the other hand, the inactive scenario is great for when you simply want to select photos from a specific time interval. Clicking the Run once icon in the scenario editor will start a one-time execution of the scenario.\n\nHow to activate\n\nA newly created scenario is, by default, inactive.

Filters will help you to select those bundles.\n\nYou can add a filter between two modules and check whether bundles received from the preceding modules fulfill specific filter conditions or not. If yes, the bundles will be passed on to the next module in the scenario. If not, their processing will be terminated.\n\nFor example, if you want to create a scenario with the Facebook trigger Watch posts and you want to work only with posts containing a specific word or posts written by a specific author, a filter would make sure you receive only these posts and nothing else.\n\nAdding a filter\n\nTo add a filter between two modules, click on the connecting line between them.\n\nThis brings up a panel where you can enter the name for the filter that is to be created and define one or more filter conditions.\n\nFor each condition, you can enter one or two operands and an operator that will determine the relation between them. In the operand field, you can enter values in the same way as you would map them.\n\nIn the example above, you can see how to connect the Gmail trigger Watch emails and the Google Drive action Upload a file. The filter automatically applies the condition to incoming bundles from the first module and only bundles containing attachments are allowed to pass on to the next module.\n\nOperators\n\nFor each condition, you can use one of several different operators.\n\nBasic operators\n\nExists - checks whether a specific bundle item is filled in. Using this operator, you can create a filter that permits, for example, only Facebook posts that contain a photo to go through to the next module in a scenario.\n\nNot exists - the opposite of exists. It permits only those bundles where a specific item is not filled in.\n\nOther operators\n\nThere are a number of other operators you can use: text comparison operators, numerical operators, time and date operators, and operators for working with arrays.\n\nCopying a filter\n\nCopying filters is currently not natively supported by the Scenario editor, though if you use the Google Chrome web browser, the following workaround can be employed:\n\nInstall Make DevTool Chrome extension.\n\nIn Make, open your scenario.\n\nIn Chrome, open the Developer tools. You can do so either by choosing the Developer tools command from the the Chrome main menu or just press Ctrl+Shift+I or F12:\n\nIn the Developer tools, click on the Make tab.\n\nClick on the Tools icon in the left side bar.\n\n.Click on the Copy filter tool and configure it in the right side panel.\n\nSet the Source Module field - the module that's right after the filter you wish to copy.\n\nSet the Target Module field - the module before which you wish to copy the filter.\n\nClick on the Run button.\n\nIn this section\nAdding a filter\nOperators\nCopying a filter\nFiltering\nAdding a filter\nOperators\nBasic operators\nOther operators\nCopying a filter\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Here you can set various advanced settings.\n\n1 - Sequential processing\n\nYou can allow Make to store information about incomplete scenario executions.\n\nThe sequential processing setting determines how Make processes recurring incomplete scenario executions. The Incomplete executions folder must contain scenario data.\n\nIf enabled, Make stops executing the scenario until you resolve all incomplete executions. This option guarantees that Make will always solve incomplete executions in sequential order.\n\nIf disabled, the scenario continues to run according to its schedule, regardless of errors.\n\nNote\n\nSequential processing also applies to webhooks. By default, Make processes webhooks in parallel. When you enable sequential processing, Make waits until the previous execution is complete before starting the next one.\n\nSee webhooks for more information.\n\n2 - Data is confidential\n\nAfter a scenario executes, you can display information about data processed by the modules. This happens by default.\n\nIf you do not want to store this information, enable the data is confidential setting.\n\nCaution\n\nIf enabled, there are very limited options to solve errors that occur in a scenario execution.\n\n3 - Allow storing of incomplete executions\n\nThis setting determines what happens if a scenario run encounters an error. You can choose how Make will process the data.\n\nIf enabled, the scenario is paused and moved to the Incomplete executions folder. This gives you the possibility to fix the issue and continue executing from where the scenario stopped.\n\nIf disabled, the scenario run stops and starts a rollback phase.\n\nYou can resolve each incomplete execution either manually or automatically.\n\nNote\n\nThe data in this folder counts towards the storage limits of your subscription plan.\n\n4 - Enable data loss\n\nMake may fail to save a data bundle to the queue of incomplete executions (e.g. due to a lack of free space). With this setting enabled, Make does not save the lost data. This is to prevent interruptions in the scenario execution.\n\nThis option is well-suited for scenarios where continuous execution is the highest priority. The incoming data is less important.\n\nScenario modules can encounter files larger than the maximum allowed size. In this case, Make proceeds according to the enable data loss setting and displays a warning message.\n\nNote\n\nThe maximum file size depends on your subscription plan.\n\n5 - Auto commit\n\nThis setting applies to transactions and defines the way to process a scenario. This setting is enabled by default.\n\nIf enabled, the commit phase on each module starts immediately after the operation phase. Data is committed right away and cannot be restored in the case of an error.\n\nIf disabled, no commit occurs until operations are executed for all modules.\n\nNote\n\nNot every module supports transactionality. Only modules marked with the tag 'ACID' support transactions.\n\n6 - Commit trigger last\n\nThis setting defines the module commit order after a successful scenario operation phase. This setting is enabled by default.\n\nIf enabled, the commit phase skips the trigger and processes that module last.\n\nIf disabled, the commit phase occurs in the default order.\n\n7 - Max number of cycles\n\nThis setting defines the maximum number of cycles allowed during a scenario execution.\n\nSetting more cycles can be useful when you want to prevent connection interruption to third-party services. This can also ensure all records are processed within the scenario run.\n\nIf you execute the scenario manually by clicking the Run once button, the setting is ignored and only one cycle will be performed.\n\nExample\n\nDropbox > Watch files retrieve files added to a folder and the Google Sheets > Add a Row module inserts the file name and file size to a new row in the sheet.\n\nMax number of cycles is set to 1 (default)\n\nThe Limit field in the Dropbox > Watch files module is set to 10.\n\nIf 100 files are added to the Dropbox folder and the Limit field is set to 10 then 90 files will be left unprocessed after one scenario run. The next 10 files will be processed in the next scheduled scenario execution.\n\nMax number of cycles is set to 10\n\nAs before, the Limit field in the Dropbox > Watch files module is set to 10.\n\nIf 100 files are added to the Dropbox folder and the Limit field option is set to 10 then 10 files will be processed during the first cycle, the next 10 files in the second cycle, the next 10 files in the third cycle, and so on, until all files are processed.\n\nAll files are processed within the one scenario run.\n\nYou can see the already run cycles in the scenario run details.\n\n8 - Number of consecutive errors\n\nThis setting defines the maximum number of consecutive execution attempts before the scenario deactivates (excluding DataError, DuplicateDataError and ConnectionError).\n\nNote\n\nIf a scenario starts with an instant trigger, the setting is ignored and the scenario is deactivated immediately once the first error has occurred.\n\nIn this section\n1 - Sequential processing\n2 - Data is confidential\n3 - Allow storing of incomplete executions\n4 - Enable data loss\n5 - Auto commit\n6 - Commit trigger last\n7 - Max number of cycles\n8 - Number of consecutive errors\nScenario settings\n1 - Sequential processing\n2 - Data is confidential\n3 - Allow storing of incomplete executions\n4 - Enable data loss\n5 - Auto commit\n6 - Commit trigger last\n7 - Max number of cycles\nExample\n8 - Number of consecutive errors\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

The restrictions are in effect as of June 1st, 2020. The purpose of the new measures is to protect Google users from leakage or misuse of their personal data on Google. New restrictions are related to the Gmail and Google Drive apps. More info here.\n\nTo access restricted scopes, the connected service (Make or any other service that wants to access the user's data via the API) has to be verified and has to have a Letter of Assessment to prove that the service is secure and transparent about how they use the data. Make complies with all of Google’s requirements for access to restricted scopes, unfortunately, most of the third-party connected services in Make don't have the Letter of Assessment and therefore don't comply with Google terms. Because of that, we are not permitted to send data to these services.\n\nThere are a few exceptions where it is possible to send data to an unapproved third-party service that doesn’t have the Letter of Assessment and doesn’t violate any of these new restrictions.\n\nWe opted for the Domain-wide Installation exception. Domain-wide Installation is suited for Google Workspace users and this approach allows users to integrate unapproved services without any limitations. Simply speaking, if you are a Google Workspace user you don't have to perform any additional steps and can directly connect to unapproved services.\n\nFAQ\nWhat apps in Make are affected?\n\nGoogle Drive, Gmail, and Email (connected to Gmail account).\n\nDo I have a Google Workspace account?\n\nIf your email address ends with @gmail.com or @googlemail.com your account is not a Google Workspace account. If your Google account ends with custom domain e.g. @my-company.com then it is a Google Workspace account.\n\nGoogle Workspace users (click on your profile icon in the top-right corner of your Google account to display the following pane):\n\nThe This account is managed by <yourCompany> information is displayed in the top of the pane.\n\nGmail (non-business) users (click on your profile icon in the top-right corner of your Google account to display the following pane):\n\nYour email address ends with the @gmail.com or googlemail.com and there is no information as in the business Google account (above).\n\nWhat should I do if I'm @gmail.com or @googlemail.com user?\n\nIf you want to integrate any other service than Google Drive or Gmail, you don’t have to do anything special to connect to your services that use your @gmail.com or @googlemail.com account to sign in. Just create a connection to the service in the regular way as described in the Connecting an application article.\n\nThe changes only apply if you are integrating Google Drive or Gmail. If you want to connect to Google Drive or Gmail then you have to switch to Google Workspace or Connecting to Google services using custom OAuth client (advanced option).\n\nWhat should I do if I'm a Google Workspace user?\n\nThere is no required action.\n\nIn this section\nFAQ\nConnecting to Google Services With New Security Measures\nFAQ\nWhat apps in Make are affected?\nDo I have a Google Workspace account?\nWhat should I do if I'm @gmail.com or @googlemail.com user?\nWhat should I do if I'm a Google Workspace user?\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Our goal is to get a list of the latest deviations. Before configuring this scenario, you have to find out some basic information about the service.\n\nFirstly, go through the Development section and find out what method DeviantArt uses for user authentication, and which API is appropriate to perform the desired function.\n\nMake supports the following authorization types:\n\nOAuth2\n\nBasic Authorization\n\nAPI key\n\nGetting ready\n\nDeviantArt uses a standardized OAuth2 protocol for authorization. You can see that in the Authentication section.\n\nCreate a so-called client to be able to communicate with the API. Click Register your application link to create a client.\n\nA form opens up that allows you to create a new application. Fill in the name and description of the application and upload the icon.\n\nIn Application settings section, fill out the OAuth2 Redirect URI Whitelist field. All services that use standard OAuth2 protocol for authorization require this parameter.\n\nThe value of this parameter is always the same ‑ https://www.integromat.com/oauth/cb/oauth2. This is the URL, that a user is redirected to after they authorize Make to access the given service. This way, Make learns that the authorization has been successful, and creates a new connection with the service.\n\nOAuth redirect URI domain\n\nNotice that the redirect URI starts with https://www.integromat.com instead of https://www.make.com. This is currently a known issue in Make.\n\nMake was formerly called Integromat, which means you can trust this URL as much as any Make URL.\n\nPlease make sure all your OAuth redirect URIs point to https://www.integromat.com/oauth/cb/oauth2.\n\nOnce you have completed the registration, a screen opens where you can view two important values - client_id and client_secret. Write down these two values, you need them later on.\n\nGo back to the Authentication section and get authorization URL and access token URL. All services that use standard authorization OAuth2 protocol always include both URL addresses in their documentation.\n\nGo to the API section which describes all API calls in detail. The API you need is in GET /browse/newest.\n\nExpand the Authentication and Parameters sections to learn which scope is required to call this API and which parameters you can send along with the request.\n\nCreating a scenario\nNote\n\nBefore you start setting up your scenario in Make, we recommend that you go through all APIs that you plan to call and get a list of all scopes that are needed. This way you can acquire all the necessary scopes at once and avoid the hassle of expanding the scopes in the future.\n\nGo to Make and create a new scenario.\n\nChoose the OAuth 2.0 HTTP(S) request and response processing module from the HTTP app and add it to your scenario.\n\nIn the open configuration window, click Add. A new window opens that allows you to add a new OAuth2 connection. In this step, enter the information that you have found in the documentation:\n\nConnection name - Enter any name you would like to identify as the connection.\n\nAuthorize URI - The Authorize URL specified in the Authentication section of the DeviantArt documentation.\n\nToken URI - The Access Token URL indicated in the Authentication section of the DeviantArt documentation.\n\nScope - Specify the list of access scope that you want to grant to Make and associate with this connection. In our case, it is enough to select the browse value.\n\nClient ID - The client ID you got when creating the application.\n\nClient secret - The secret key you were given once you had created the application.\n\nClick Create a connection.\n\nA new window pops up. Click Authorize App to authorize Make to access the given service via the application you have created.\n\nThe access tokens exchange in the background automatically. The configuration window automatically populates with the newly created connection.\n\nSet up the URL address of the API endpoint according to the specifications given in the API documentation and specify optional parameters (in our case, we will enter https://www.deviantart.com/api/v1/oauth2/browse/newest).\n\nWhen creating a scenario, we recommend working with a smaller number of bundles.\n\nTesting\n\nRun your scenario.\n\nIf the execution results show that the call ended with a 200 status, the run completed successfully. The response details contain complete JSON data that is available for further use.\n\nCopy the whole JSON response to the system clipboard - you’ll need it in order to generate a data structure.\n\nThanks to the data structures, Make knows exactly what structure the received data has.\n\nUse JSON app > Parse JSON module to parse your data in order to use the data in your scenario.\n\nIn the settings of Parse JSON module, map the Data  variable from the HTTP app to the JSON string field.\n\nNext to the Data structure field, click Add. A panel opens. Select Generator.\n\nIn the data structure generator, choose the JSON value as Content type. In the Sample data field paste the JSON response from the server that you have copied to the system clipboard.\n\nOnce you confirm your entries, the data structure generates automatically.\n\nGive a name to the Data structure and click Save. \n\nClick Save to confirm the settings.\n\nRun the scenario.\n\nOnce the scenario run completes, view details of the JSON module run. If everything has been processed without errors, you will see a list of 5 new DeviantArt deviations. You can then easily browse through the data structure and map obtained values to other modules.\n\nIn this section\nGetting ready\nCreating a scenario\nTesting\nHow to connect Make to any web service that uses OAuth2 authorization\nGetting ready\nCreating a scenario\nTesting\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

You can connect the desired service (app) to Make using Make's HTTP module.\n\nIn the following article, we will describe how to connect almost any web service to Make using an API Key/API token.\n\nLike it is for most web services, the procedure of connecting the service via an API token is similar and consists of the following steps:\n\nCreate an application on the web service's website.\n\nObtain the API Key/API token.\n\nAdd Make's HTTP > Make an API Key Auth request module to your scenario.\n\nSet up the module according to the web service's API documentation and run the scenario.\n\nNote\n\nWe will use the Pushover notification service as an example.\n\nCreating a new application and obtaining the API token\n\nLog in to your Pushover account.\n\nClick Create an Application/API Token.\n\nFill in the application information and click Create an Application.\n\nStore the provided API token in a safe place. You will need it for your HTTP > Make an API Auth Key Request module to connect to the desired web service (Pushover, in this case).\n\nSetting up the HTTP module\n\nTo connect a web service to your Make scenario, you need to:\n\nAdd the HTTP > Make an API Key Auth request module to your Make scenario.\n\nSet up the HTTP > Make an API Key Auth request module according to the web service's API documentation.\n\nAdd the HTTP > Make an API Key Auth request module to your scenario.\n\nUnder Credentials, click Add.\n\nEnter your Pushover API Key into the Key field. Make hides your key. You can click on the visibility icon to view your key.\n\nEnter the following to integrate your Pushover account with Make:\n\nNote\n\nThese module settings correspond to the Pushover web service API documentation. Settings vary across web services. For example, some services require the API token in the Header and not in the Body field.\n\nURL : https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json\n\nThe URL field contains the endpoint that you can find in the respective web service's API documentation.\n\nMethod: POST\n\nSelect a method based on the endpoint you want to use. The Pushover endpoint for pushing messages requires the POST method.\n\nHeaders: Some web services may use Headers to specify the API token authentication and/or other parameters. This is not the case in our example as the Pushover's endpoint for pushing messages uses Body (see below) for all request types.\n\nQuery String: Some web services may use Query String to specify other parameters. This is not the case in our example as the Pushover web service uses Body (see below) for all request types.\n\nBody Type: Raw - This setting allows you to select the JSON content type in the Content Type field below.\n\nContent Type: JSON (application/json)\n\nJSON is the required content type by the Pushover app. This may differ from other web services.\n\nRequest Content: Enter the Body request content in the JSON format. You can use the JSON > Create JSON module or enter the JSON content manually.\n\nNote\n\nSee the web service's API documentation for the required parameters (fields).\n\nManually enter the JSON request body\n\nSpecify the following parameters in JSON format:\n\nuser\n\n\t\n\nThe user key from your Pushover dashboard.\n\n\n\n\ntoken\n\n\t\n\nThe API token that you generated in step 4.\n\n\n\n\nmessage\n\n\t\n\nThe text content of the push notification sent to your devices.\n\n\n\n\ntitle\n\n\t\n\nOptional The message's title. If left blank, your app's name is the title by default.\n\nExample:\n\n{\"user\":\"12345c2ecu1hq42ypqzhswbyam34\",\n\"token\":\"123459evz8aepwtxydndydgyumbfx\",\n\"message\":\"Hello World!\",\n\"title\":\"The Push Notification\"}\nJSON body mapped using the JSON > Create JSON module\n\nThe Create JSON module helps you create the JSON required for your request body. It also gives you the possibility to define values dynamically. For more information about the JSON modules please refer to the JSON documentation.\n\nEnter (or map) the values you want to create JSON from.\n\nConnect the JSON > Create JSON module to the HTTP > Make an API Key Auth Request module you have already set up (above).\n\nMap the JSON string from the Create JSON module to the Request content field in the HTTP > Make an API Key Auth Request module.\n\nNow when you run the scenario, the push notification is sent to the device registered in your Pushover account.\n\nIn this section\nCreating a new application and obtaining the API token\nSetting up the HTTP module\nConnecting Make to any web service that uses API tokens authorization\nCreating a new application and obtaining the API token\nSetting up the HTTP module\nManually enter the JSON request body\nJSON body mapped using the JSON > Create JSON module\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

An organization can contain any number of teams.\n\nYou register users into an organization. Then, you assign users to teams. A user can be a member of any number of organizations and any number of teams. A user can have a different role in each team.\n\nCreating teams\n\nYou can create teams in the Organization > Teams section.\n\nYou create teams inside organizations. You must be an owner or an admin of an organization to manage its teams.\n\nGo to Organization > Teams.\n\nClick Add a new team.\n\nEnter the new team's name and click Add.\n\nThe new team appears in the list of teams. Click the team name or the Edit button to manage team members.\n\nManaging teams\n\nTeams allow you to view the team's consumption of operations and data transfer, manage team members and their roles, and set up notifications.\n\nMonitoring operations and Scenario executions\n\nMake allows you to monitor operations and data transfer consumed by each team. Click Team in the menu to view these statistics.\n\nSince scenarios always belong to teams, their execution history is also tracked for each team separately.\n\nManaging team members\n\nWhen adding users to teams, you assign team roles to the users. Roles determine what permissions users have and what users can do with the team's data.\n\nTo manage team members, go to Team > Users. The Users section shows all users in your organization and the role they have in the selected team. Users who don't belong to the selected team have their team role set to None.\n\nTo add a user to the team, click the Role menu and select a role other than None.\n\nYou can assign users to the following roles:\n\nTeam Admin has full access to all data within the team. Only team admins can create custom functions.\n\nTeam Member has full access to all data within the team, but cannot manage team members and cannot delete the team.\n\nTeam Monitoring has read-only access to the team, scenarios, and templates.\n\nTeam Operator has read-only access to all data within the team. In addition, the Team Operator can activate or stop scenarios and set up scenario schedules.\n\nTeam Restricted Member has full access to all data within the team, but cannot modify the team.\n\nSee the table below for details on team role permissions.\n\nTo remove a user from a team, select None from the Role menu.

Your team doesn't have a team email so you want your colleagues to use their work emails when they run the scenario:\n\nYou can set a dynamic connection in both Gmail modules. That way, your teammates can use their own Gmail connections to send the emails when they run the scenario.\n\nNote\n\nDynamic connections are available to the Enterprise plan users only.\n\nCreating a scenario with a dynamic connection\n\nAlmost every module requires a connection to work properly. To create a scenario with a dynamic connection, you have to assign a connection to build the scenario. Make calls the initial connection as the \"build-time value.\"\n\nWhen you finish the scenario, you can assign a different connection to the dynamic connection anytime.\n\nGo to your scenario and select an app module.\n\nClick the  button, and then click Create a dynamic connection.\n\nIn the Dynamic connection name field, type the name of the connection.\n\nSet the Build-time value for the dynamic connection:\n\nIn the Build-time value, choose a connection to use when building the scenario or click Add to create a new connection.\n\nIn the Connection name field, enter a name for the connection.\n\nClick Save. Dropbox prompts you to grant Make access to your data.\n\nGrant Make access to your Dropbox account.\n\nClick Save.\n\nYou have set the build-time value for the dynamic connection. You can see the connection in the Build-time value field.\n\nSelect whether you want to use the build-time connection as the default or not. Make uses the default value to run the scenario. You can select a different connection when you run the scenario on-demand.\n\n(Optional): You can select the dynamic connection default value in the Default value selection box or create a new connection with the Add button.\n\nNote\n\nIf you don't provide a default for the dynamic connection, you can schedule the scenario to On-demand only.\n\nClick Save.\n\nYou created a dynamic connection. Now you can continue configuring the module.\n\nTip\n\nYou can set the default for the dynamic connection in the scenario inputs interface as well:\n\nYou can find the list of dynamic connections:\n\nIn the module:\n\nIn the Scenario inputs window:\n\nIn the Build-time value tab, the dynamic connection with the connection its using:\n\nRunning a scenario with a dynamic connection\n\nA dynamic connection is like a variable or a container for connections, which is empty until you assign a connection to it. To run a scenario with a dynamic connection, you have to assign a connection to it or use a default. You can either create a new dynamic connection or use an existing one.\n\nUsing an existing dynamic connection\n\nTo run a scenario with a dynamic connection, use the scenario inputs. In scenario inputs, assign a connection to the dynamic connection for your scenario run or use the default.\n\nNote\n\nTo run your scenario on schedule, you have to provide a default for your dynamic connections. Make uses the default connection in scheduled scenario runs.\n\nGo to your scenario.\n\nClick Run once. A scenario inputs window appears.\n\nYou can either set up a new connection or use an existing connection.\n\nTo set up a new connection, click Add. The app prompts you to grant Make access to your account.\n\nTo use a connection that already exists, select the connection from the dropdown list.\n\nNote\n\nThe dropdown list shows only connections available for the app.\n\nClick OK.\n\nMake runs the scenario with the selected connections.\n\nUpdating a dynamic connection\n\nCompared to other connections, dynamic connections are flexible and can change the value they contain. For example, you might want to assign a different connection to the dynamic connection with each scenario run. This might be practical when you want to frequently use different credentials in the scenario.\n\nAnother option is to update just the default for the dynamic connection for scheduled scenario runs.\n\nYou can update a dynamic connection:\n\nin the app module\n\nin scenario inputs\n\nUpdating dynamic connections in the app module\n\nOpen the Connections dropdown list in the app module and find the dynamic connection you want to edit.\n\nClick Edit.\n\nOptional: You can change the dynamic connection name as well.\n\nIn the Build-time value dropdown list, select the connection you want to assign to the dynamic connection. Click Add, if you want to create a new connection.\n\nClick Save.\n\nYou have updated the dynamic connection. When the scenario runs, the dynamic connection will use the connection you assigned.\n\nUpdating dynamic connections in the scenario inputs\n\nGo to the scenario in which you want to update the dynamic connection.\n\nClick scenario inputs.\n\nGo to the Build-time value tab.\n\nClick Edit.\n\nIn the dropdown list, select another connection you want to assign to the dynamic connection.

The addUserToDefaultSsoTeams parameter lets you define whether the new user is automatically added to the default team(s) designated in your SSO configuration. If the new user is not assigned to your default team(s), you can assign the new user to any team in your organization by using the API call POST/users/{userId}/user-team-roles/{teamId}.\n\nPOST /users/user-sso-create\nREQUIRED PERMISSION: USERS SSO EDIT\n\nThis endpoint creates a new user in your organization and assigns their SSO external ID in one API call. Use the addUserToDefaultSsoTeams parameter to define whether the new user is automatically added to the team(s) designated as default in your SSO configuration.

For example, a connection lets Make check your Gmail and enter the sender and subject into Google Sheets.\n\nBecause third parties have different technologies and standards, there are different ways to create connections in Make. For some apps, creating a connection requires logging in to the third-party app and clicking that you agree to let Make access your profile and data. Other third parties require an API key or OAuth credentials.\n\nMake offers two types of connections:\n\nStandard - the most common kind of connection and the type explained in this article.\n\nDynamic - a feature for Enterprise customers that lets you easily switch between multiple connections. This way you can have a separate connection for each team or department in your company and change them as needed.\n\nCreating a connection\n\nYou create connections in the scenario editor when you add a module. All users in your team can use any connections you create in that team. Use your personal third-party account and credentials carefully, especially when your team has other users.\n\nImportant\n\nAll team members can manage connections as well. If you want to connect Make with your personal account or data, consider creating a separate team where you are the only member.\n\nThe following is the general way to create a connection. For more details, see the article on the specific app you want to connect.\n\nGo to your scenario and add a module. For example, click + and search for Dropbox. Then select the module you want, such as Create a Folder.\n\nClick Create a connection.\n\nIn the Connection name field, you can name your connection. For example, if you have two different Dropbox accounts, you might name one Dropbox-Company, and the second Dropbox-Personal.\n\nTip\n\nIf your app has fields for:\n\nCredentials such as username and password\n\nAPI Key\n\nClient ID and client secret\n\nAnything not on this list\n\nRefer to the article on the specific app you want to connect for more information.\n\nClick Save. A new window prompts you to grant Make access to your data.\n\nTip\n\nSteps 4 and 5 can vary. Carefully follow on-screen instructions when granting consent.\n\nGrant Make access to your Dropbox account and data.\n\nYou created a connection between your Dropbox account and Make and you can continue setting up the module. You can find the connection in the Connections section:\n\nManaging connections\n\nThe connections tab lets you do any of the following to your connections:\n\nEdit\n\nVerify\n\nReauthorize\n\nDelete\n\nYou can find the connections by clicking  in the left sidebar.\n\nEdit connections\n\nYou can edit the setup of some connections. Clicking Edit for a connection opens a pop-up where you can adjust the information you previously entered.\n\nVerify connections\n\nYou can see whether your connection works by clicking Verify. The button briefly changes to Verifying ... as Make checks. A green check mark in a circle appears when successful.\n\nReauthorize connections\n\nSome third parties, such as Google only grant access for a limited time. In this case, you may need to occasionally reauthorize your connection. Just click Reauthorize and follow any on-screen prompts that appear.\n\nDelete connections\n\nIf you need to delete a connection, click Delete. The button turns red and asks again to confirm that you want to erase that connection. Click again to delete your connection.\n\nCaution\n\nDeleting a connection may cause your scenarios to stop working. Be sure that the connection is not used in any scheduled or active scenarios.\n\nIn this section\nCreating a connection\nManaging connections\nConnecting an application\nCreating a connection\nManaging connections\nEdit connections\nVerify connections\nReauthorize connections\nDelete connections\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Extra operations auto-purchasing covers you when you reach your limit of operations by automatically purchasing extra operations.\n\nWhen you use all of the operations in your subscription, Make automatically purchases 10,000 extra operations. All automatic purchases are in units of 10,000 operations. Make then charges you for the 10,000 extra operations.\n\nIf you use all 10,000 extra operations, Make auto-purchases 10,000 operations again. Make limits auto-purchasing to the number of operations in your subscription. For example. if your plan has 80,000 operations, Make auto-purchases a maximum of 8 times.\n\nExample\n\nIn this example, you have a monthly subscription plan with 80,000 operations. You enable extra operations auto-purchasing. When you use all 80,000 of your monthly operations, the following happens:\n\nMake automatically purchases 10,000 operations and keeps your scenarios running.\n\nCaution\n\nIf your payment fails, your scenarios pause until you update your payment method. Make sends you an email notification when your payment fails.\n\nMake charges you for the 10,000 operations based on your plan and adds a 30% surcharge.\n\nLet's assume that your scenarios use all 10,000 extra operations before the monthly billing cycle renews. Extra operations auto-purchasing buys an additional 10,000 operations.\n\nSo far, extra operations auto-purchasing has purchased a total of 20,000. Your auto-purchase limit per monthly cycle is 80,000 operations. In this example, extra operations auto-purchasing is only possible six more times, i.e. 60,000 extra operations.\n\nEnable extra operations auto-purchasing\n\nGo to your organization dashboard.\n\nClick the toggle for extra operations auto-purchasing.\n\nIn the pop-up, select a payment method.\n\nCaution\n\nExtra operations auto-purchasing only accepts card payments.\n\nIf you do not have a saved payment card, the pop-up instructs you to enter a new payment. Click Enter a payment method and follow the on-screen instructions.\n\nAfter you enter and save a payment method, a redirect takes you back to your organization dashboard. Repeat steps 2 and 3 above.\n\nClick Turn on.\n\nThe pop-up disappears and the toggle now displays its status as On.\n\nDisable extra operations auto-purchasing\n\nGo to your organization dashboard.\n\nClick the toggle for extra operations auto-purchasing.\n\nIn the pop-up, click Turn off.\n\nThe pop-up disappears and the toggle now displays its status as Off.\n\nIn this section\nExample\nEnable extra operations auto-purchasing\nDisable extra operations auto-purchasing\nEnable extra operations auto-purchasing\nExample\nEnable extra operations auto-purchasing\nDisable extra operations auto-purchasing\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

However, Make uses organization time zones and user time zones differently:\n\nThe organization time zone defines the time used when executing scenarios and modules. For example, a scenario schedule of \"4:00 pm every day\" means 4:00 pm in the organization's time zone.\n\nThe user time zone is similar to locale and defines how Make displays time, for example, in scenario execution history.\n\nAs a result, organization members in a time zone different from the organization's time zone may see different times displayed. See the example below for more details.\n\nYour profile page lets you view and edit time zone settings from the Time Zone Options tab.\n\nExample\n\nA Make organization based in New York City has members in New York City, Los Angeles, and London. When members view scenario execution histories, they see that information relative to their local time zone. Members in London see the time scenarios executed in London time, Los Angeles members see those execution times in LA time, and so on. However, when they schedule scenarios, Make uses New York City time regardless of the user's location.\n\nUser name\n\n\t\n\nUser city and time zone\n\n\t\n\nOrganization time zone\n\n\t\n\nTime zone that the user sees in scenario editor and logs\n\n\t\n\nTime zone used for scenario execution\n\n\n\n\nAmal\n\n\t\n\nNew York\n\n(GMT-05:00) America/New_York\n\n\t\n\n(GMT-05:00) America/New_York\n\n\t\n\n(GMT-05:00) America/New_York\n\n\t\n\n(GMT-05:00) America/New_York\n\n\n\n\nBola\n\n\t\n\nLos Angeles\n\n(GMT-08:00) America/Los_Angeles\n\n\t\n\n(GMT-05:00) America/New_York\n\n\t\n\n(GMT-08:00) America/Los_Angeles\n\n\t\n\n(GMT-05:00) America/New_York\n\n\n\n\nCharlie\n\n\t\n\nLondon\n\n(GMT+0:00) Europe/London\n\n\t\n\n(GMT-05:00) America/New_York\n\n\t\n\n(GMT+0:00) Europe/London\n\n\t\n\n(GMT-05:00) America/New_York\n\nManage organization time zone\n\nMake uses an organization's time zone to define when a scheduled scenario executes. The organization time zone defines scenario execution and functions such as formatDate and parseDate. Unless otherwise specified, Make uses the organization time zone as the default time for time and date-related functions and scenario execution. You can view and edit your organization time zones on the Time Zone Options tab of the profile page.\n\nNote\n\nOnly organization owners and admins can edit the organization's time zone.\n\nGo to your profile page and click Time Zone Options.\n\nMake lists your organizations under Scenarios and displays the current time zone setting.\n\nClick  to edit an organization's setting.\n\nA dialog appears where you can use the menu to search and select a new time zone.\n\nClick Save.\n\nThe selected time zone now appears on the Time Zone Options page.\n\nAny scehduled scenarios execute at the scheduled time in the time zone you assigned in step 4.\n\nManage user time zone\n\nMake uses your user time zone to display time and date information. For example, execution logs display the time in your user time zone. The user time zone only impacts how Make displays information, such as the date and time displayed in module output, bundles, or a log. Changing the user time zone does not impact scenario execution. You can view and edit your user time zone anytime on the Time Zone Options tab of the profile page:\n\nGo to your profile page and click Time Zone Options.\n\nFind your name in the Web section. Make displays the current time zone setting.\n\nClick  to edit your settings.\n\nA dialog appears where you can use the menu to search and select a new time zone.\n\nClick Save.\n\nThe selected time zone now appears on the Time Zone Options page.\n\nIn this section\nExample\nManage organization time zone\nManage user time zone\nManage time zones\nExample\nManage organization time zone\nManage user time zone\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Example, xrCeZkqA.\n\nRedeeming a coupon gives you one of the following:\n\nFree trials of a subscription plan\n\nDiscounts on subscription plans, such as your current plan or higher\n\nExtra operations\n\nHow to redeem coupons\n\nOnly organization admins and owners can redeem coupons. If you are not an admin or the owner of an organization, contact them to redeem your coupon.\n\nGo to Organization > Subscription and click Redeem coupon.\n\nEnter your coupon code and click Redeem coupon.\n\nIn the payment checkout, your coupon appears in the details of your plan. Review the details and click Redeem Coupon.\n\nNote\n\nDepending on the details of your discount and your plan, you may be redirected to a payment gateway to finish redeeming your coupon.\n\nTo confirm the successful redemption of your coupon, check the details in the Organization panel, Subscription panel, or Subscription > My Plan.\n\nSubscription coupons\nSubscription coupons and your plan\n\nUsing a coupon for a subscription plan places you on that plan if you have a saved payment method.\n\nTo return to the plan you had before the coupon, change your subscription before your coupon expires.\n\nIf you do not have a valid payment method saved, you will have a Free plan when your coupon expires.\n\nSubscription coupons and your billing cycle\n\nAfter you redeem your subscription coupon, your billing cycle changes. The day you redeem your coupon becomes the new start date of your billing cycle.\n\nExample:\n\nYou have a Core plan that renews on the 20th of each month. You receive a coupon for the Teams plan. On the 15th you redeem your coupon. The 15th is now the beginning of your monthly billing cycle.\n\nExceptions:\n\nCoupons for the same plan do not impact your billing cycle. For example, a discount on your current plan.\n\nCore plans with an annual subscription have different billing and reset cycles. See the note on Core plans in our article on changing your subscription.\n\nTip\n\nYou can only have 1 subscription coupon applied to your subscription plan at a time. Redeeming a second plan coupon cancels the first. This limit does not apply to coupons for extra operations. You can combine coupons for plans and extra operations.\n\nExtra operations\n\nYou do not need a saved payment method to use coupons for extra operations.\n\nExtra operations are valid for the length of your billing cycle and expire on your billing day.\n\nExample:\n\nYou have a coupon for 10,000 extra operations and your monthly subscription is the 15th of the month. If you redeem the extra operations on the 14th, they are valid until the 15th.\n\nNote\n\nExtra operations are valid until the end of your billing cycle regardless of how many other coupons you redeem.\n\nIn this section\nHow to redeem coupons\nSubscription coupons\nExtra operations\nCoupons\nHow to redeem coupons\nSubscription coupons\nSubscription coupons and your plan\nSubscription coupons and your billing cycle\nExtra operations\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

These terms do not apply when downgrading to the Free plan.\n\nNo cash refund\n\nMake has no cash refund policy.\n\nIf you decide to upgrade we convert your unused operations to credit. If you decide to downgrade we transfer your unused operations to the new plan. Learn more in the upgrade and downgrade section.\n\nUpgrading your subscription\nTypes of upgrade\n\nYou can upgrade between plans and between tiers. Plans differ in features, and tiers refer to the number of operations.\n\nAn upgrade can be:\n\nChanging from a lower plan to a higher plan, regardless of the tier (e.g. changing from the highest tier in Core to the lowest tier in Teams)\n\nChanging within the same plan to a higher tier (e.g. from 10,000 operations per month in Pro to 150,000 operations per month in Pro)\n\nChanging from a monthly to an annual subscription to an equal or higher tier (e.g. changing from 10,000 per month in Pro to 120,000 per year in Pro)\n\nHow to upgrade\n\nGo to Organization > Subscription.\n\nA purple border and highlight mark your current plan.\n\nUse the toggle to select a monthly or annual subscription.\n\nClick the arrow to open a drop-down menu with different operation tiers. Choose the number of operations in your new plan.\n\nClick Buy plan on your chosen plan and tier. Annual subscriptions appear as Buy yearly plan.\n\nLeft: monthly subscription; Right: annual subscription\n\nCheck your billing info and use the edit button  to update if necessary.\n\nClick Select payment method.\n\nUse the drop down menu to select a payment method.\n\nFollow the on-screen instructions from Stripe checkout.\n\nReview your payment information and click Subscribe.\n\nA notification pops up saying that your plan was successfully changed. Your new plan is highlighted on the subscription page.\n\nCredit\n\nIf you decide to upgrade, we convert your unused operations (including purchased extra operations) to credit in dollars according to the price per operation in your current plan.\n\nWe deduct this credit immediately from your payment for the new upgraded subscription. The credit is visible in the checkout page calculation.\n\nCredit calculation explained\n\nFor example, you want to upgrade from Core to Pro, and you have 160,000 unused operations. We convert these unused operations to credit. You can find the calculation logic below.\n\nWe calculate the price per single operation in your original price plan.\n\nWe do this by dividing the price of the plan with the number of operations.\n\nIn this example the original price of the Core plan is $113.85 and it has 150,000 operations per month.\n\n$113.85 divided by 150,000 operations equals $0,000759 per one operation.\n\nWe multiply the price per operation with the number of unused operations.\n\nOur price per operation is $0.00075 and there are 160,000 unused operations.\n\n$0.000759 multiplied with 160,000 unused operations equals $121.44, which is the amount of the credit you can see deducted on the checkout page.\n\nThe credit amount cannot exceed the amount of your total bill.\n\nDowngrading your subscription\nTypes of downgrade\n\nYou can downgrade between plans and between tiers. Plans differ in features, and tiers refer to the number of operations.\n\nA downgrade can be:\n\nChanging from a higher plan to a lower plan, regardless of the tier (e.g. changing from the lowest tier in Teams to the highest tier in Core)\n\nChanging within the same plan to a lower tier (e.g. changing from 150,000 operations in Pro to 10,000 operations in Pro)\n\nChanging from an annual to a monthly subscription to a lower tier is a downgrade (e.g. changing from 240,000 operations per year in Pro to 20,000 operations per month in Pro).\n\nHow to downgrade\n\nGo to Dashboard > Subscription.\n\nChoose the plan you want to downgrade to. Choose the number of operations in your plan.\n\nIn the example below, the current plan is Teams with the minimum number of operations. So you can downgrade to any tier in Core or Pro.\n\nIn your new plan and tier, click Downgrade.\n\nA popup window appears. Click Downgrade to ... plan (the ... part changes according to your plan).\n\nCheck your billing info and update if necessary by using the edit button .\n\nClick Select payment method.\n\nUse the drop menu to select a payment method and click Proceed to payment.\n\nOn the Stripe checkout screen, review your details and click Subscribe.\n\nA notification pops up saying that your plan was successfully changed. Your new plan is highlighted on the subscription page.\n\nTransfer of unused operations\n\nIf you want to downgrade, we transfer your unused operations to the new downgraded plan in a 1:1 ratio. You can use the transferred operations in the new downgrade plan for the length of your new billing cycle:\n\n30 days for a monthly plan\n\n365 days for an annual plan\n\nFor example, you decide to downgrade from Pro plan to Core plan and you have 10,000 operations left. In the Core plan, you choose the tier with 150,000 operations/month, so in the first month of the downgrade, you have 160,000 operations available.\n\nFirst you use the operations within your subscription, then the extra/transferred operations. You can see the number of operations you have on your Dashboard.\n\nData is also automatically transferred with the operations. In Integromat operations and data transfer were separate.\n\nCanceling your subscription\n\nYou can cancel your subscription at any time.\n\nHow to cancel your subscription\n\nGo to Dashboard > Subscription > My plan.\n\nClick Cancel subscription.\n\nA new dialog opens. Click Cancel subscription to cancel.\n\nWe will send you a confirmation email similar to the following example:\n\nWhat happens after cancellation\n\nWe don't charge you for the next month, but you can still use your current subscription until the end of your billing cycle. After that, we switch you to the Free plan (assuming that you are not the owner of another organization with the Free plan).\n\nWe don't transfer your unused operations to that Free plan. You will have the standard Free subscription (i.e. 1,000 operations per month). This applies to both monthly and annual subscriptions.\n\nAbout canceling organizations\n\nYou can have only one free organization under your account.\n\nWhen you set an organization to a Free plan (either create a new free organization or set a current one to free), for the next one month it is not possible to set another organization to a Free plan.\n\nIf you have multiple organizations under your account and one subscription is already canceled, each subsequent organization you cancel is set as an organization without a license. You cannot run any scenarios under this organization until you subscribe to a new plan.\n\nExtra operations\n\nYou can buy extra operations at any time from your organization dashboard. Make consumes the operations included in your subscription first and then your extra operations. For example, if your subscription has 40,000 operations per month, you use those operations before consuming any extra operations you purchase. Operations 0 to 40,000 are your subscription. Operations 40,001 and onward are your extra operations.\n\nNote\n\nExtra operations also give you additional data transfer but do not impact other usage allowance parameters. See the information on our usage allowance policy for more details.\n\nHow to buy extra operations\n\nGo to Dashboard > Organization > Buy extra operations.\n\nYou can also access the same dialog via Dashboard > My plan > Buy extra operations.\n\nUse the + and - buttons to enter how many extra operations in units of 1,000.\n\nPrice per extra operation\n\nThe price for the extra operations is identical to the price per operation within your pricing plan and tier.\n\nFor example, if you are subscribed to a $9 plan and have 10,000 operations, 1 operation costs you $0.0009 ($9 / 10,000 operations). If you decide to buy 1,000 extra operations, it costs you $0.9 (1,000 operations * $0.0009). If you decide to buy 10,000 extra operations, it costs you $9 (10,000 operations * $0.0009).\n\nClick Select payment method.\n\nUse the drop-down menu to select a payment card.\n\nNote\n\nYou can only use credit/debit cards to pay for extra operations.\n\nClick Proceed to Payment.\n\nYou will see the extra operations on your dashboard.\n\nA notification briefly appears in the lower right. You can check your extra operations anytime on your dashboard.\n\nValidity of extra operations\n\nExtra operations are valid for the current billing cycle. For example, you have monthly billing and your billing cycle is from the first until the last day of the month. If you buy extra operations on the 20th, your extra operations are valid until the last day of that month.\n\nIf you have an annual plan, extra operations expire at the end of your billing year.\n\nImportant\n\nFor Core plan with an annual subscription, operations reset every month and your extra operations expire with the monthly reset.\n\nMonthly and annual subscription\n\nYou can choose between a monthly or an annual subscription.\n\nMonthly subscription\n\nIf you have a monthly subscription, your billing cycle is one month. For example, if you subscribe on 12 January, your next payment is due on 12 February.\n\nIf you have a monthly subscription, you get the monthly allocation of operations in the tier you choose.\n\nAnnual subscription\n\nIf you have an annual subscription, you pay the whole yearly amount up front and we allocate all the operations that belong in the specific plan and tier you chose. There is no monthly operations allotment, but the bulk of operations is available for you to use flexibly over the year.\n\nImportant\n\nWith the Core plan you always have monthly allocated operations, even if you have an annual subscription. Only Pro and Teams plans have an annual package of operations.\n\nChanging your billing cycle\n\nIf you change from a monthly to an annual subscription, and vice versa, we look at your current and future operations tier. The tier determines whether the action is an upgrade or a downgrade.\n\nChanging from a monthly to an annual subscription to an equal or higher tier is an upgrade (e.g. changing from 10,000 per month in Pro to 120,000 per year in Pro).\n\nChanging from an annual to a monthly subscription to a lower tier is a downgrade (e.g. changing from 240,000 operations per year in Pro to 20,000 operations per month in Pro).\n\nIn this section\nUpgrading your subscription\nDowngrading your subscription\nCanceling your subscription\nExtra operations\nMonthly and annual subscription\nChanging your subscription (upgrading, downgrading, or canceling)\nUpgrading your subscription\nTypes of upgrade\nHow to upgrade\nCredit\nDowngrading your subscription\nTypes of downgrade\nHow to downgrade\nTransfer of unused operations\nCanceling your subscription\nHow to cancel your subscription\nWhat happens after cancellation\nExtra operations\nHow to buy extra operations\nValidity of extra operations\nMonthly and annual subscription\nMonthly subscription\nAnnual subscription\nChanging your billing cycle\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

This will give you access to a more stable and reliable infrastructure. Make provides an effective tool to let you migrate your data fast and easy.\n\nIn this article, you will learn how to use the Make Migration tool to move your data and start enjoying the Enterprise plan.\n\nMigration scope overview\n\nThe Migration tool has two modes:\n\nFast mode enables automatic migration of selected scenarios and their associated data. In some cases, the system may require you to take manual steps.\n\nManual mode allows you to choose which data to migrate and how to handle it in your Enterprise instance.\n\nWhich data can you migrate?\n\nThe Migration tool migrates the following items:\n\nScenarios and scenario folders;\n\nConnections (except those that are associated with connected systems and On-prem Agents);\n\nWebhooks and mailhooks;\n\nKeys;\n\nData stores;\n\nData structures;\n\nCustom apps.\n\nNote\n\nIf the following items exist in your source instance, but no scenarios use them, the Migration tool doesn't move them to the target instance:\n\nConnections;\n\nWebhooks and mailhooks;\n\nKeys;\n\nData stores;\n\nData structures.\n\nWhich data can't you migrate?\n\nUser accounts;\n\nOrganizations;\n\nScenario executions history and logs;\n\nIncomplete executions;\n\nConnections associated with connected systems and On-prem Agents;\n\nWebhook and mailhook queues and logs;\n\nDevices;\n\nPayment details and extra operations.\n\nPrepare your data\n\nThe Migration tool has some peculiarities that you need to keep in mind when migrating your data either in a fast or a manual mode. To arrange your target instance better, consider taking some measures that allow you to overcome limits of the Migration tool.\n\nTeams\n\nKeep in mind that: Migration involves transferring data from one team in the source instance to another team in the target instance.\n\nDo it: To have your data in different teams in the target instance:\n\nIn the target instance, create as many teams as needed.\n\nIn the Migration tool, select the team you want to migrate scenarios to, and then select the specific scenarios to be moved to the selected team.\n\nTip\n\nYou can't move scenarios from one team to another after finishing migration. When migration is complete, you can clone scenarios and select the desired team for them.\n\nTo avoid data inconsistency, we recommend not migrating data from the same team more than once.\n\nTime zones\n\nKeep in mind that: The Migration tool doesn't migrate the time zone settings. You need to set up time zones in the target instance.\n\nDo it: If you aim to run scenarios in the target instance according to the time zone that you have in the source instance, manually set up a time zone in the target instance. Learn more about managing time zones.\n\nScenarios\n\nKeep in mind that: If your scenarios contain apps that require you to whitelist IP addresses for access, you need them to have relevant IPs associated with the target instance.\n\nDo it: Before migrating such scenarios, add the following IPs to apps depending on your zone: eu1.make.celonis.com or us1.make.celonis.com. You may delete those IPs from apps in the source instance after the migration is done.\n\nKeep in mind that: The Migration tool doesn't migrate a webhook or mailhook queue. It can cause problems if you use sequential processing because scenarios data may arrive to the target instance before the queue is processed in the source instance.\n\nDo it: To ensure sequential processing, do one of the options:\n\nOption 1: Process the entire queue in the source instance before migrating.\n\nOption 2:\n\nMigrate scenarios in the manual mode.\n\nDisable scenarios in the target instance and enable scenarios in the source instance.\n\nProcess the webhook queue.\n\nOnce all the data is processed, enable scenarios in the target instance.\n\nNote\n\nData received after migration goes to the new webhook URL and will be processed once you enable scenarios in the target instance.\n\nConnections\n\nKeep in mind that: The Migration tool doesn't replace one connection with another if they have different scopes and permissions.\n\nDo it: Ensure that scopes and permissions of connections in the target instance match scopes and permissions of connections that you want to replace.\n\nData stores\n\nKeep in mind that: Data may be inconsistent between the source and target instances if the Migration tool moves scenarios that update data stores more frequently than every five minutes.\n\nDo it: To avoid inconsistency:\n\nStop all scenarios in the source instance before starting migration.\n\nNote\n\nYou have to stop only scenarios that contain the Add/replace a record, Delete all records, Delete a record, and Update a record modules.\n\nMigrate scenarios.\n\nRun scenarios in the target instance.\n\nCustom apps\n\nKeep in mind that: You cannot migrate scenarios with published custom apps if you didn't install those apps into the target instance beforehand.\n\nDo it: To have scenarios with custom apps in the target instance:\n\nIf the custom app has the Private status, publish it. Refer to the App Builder documentation to learn more.\n\nNote\n\nIt is not possible to migrate apps that have the Private status. Publish the app after making all the necessary changes.\n\nWhen the custom app has the Published status, you cannot:\n\nMake the custom app Private again\n\nDelete the custom app\n\nDelete a module from the custom app\n\nInstall the published custom app in the target instance.\n\nMigrate scenarios.\n\nMigrate your data\n\nIt's time to proceed with the migration process. You can migrate as many scenarios as you want at once. If you didn't migrate all scenarios at once, you can continue later.\n\nFollow the next steps to start migration:\n\nGo to the Migration tool.\n\nRead all the information and click Let's start.\n\nIn the Source and Target sections, select Make.\n\nIn both sections, click Sign in to source and Sign in to target respectively, and log in to both Make instances. Then click Continue.\n\nIn both Organization dropdown lists, select the source organization to migrate data from, and the target organization to migrate the data into\n\nIn both Team dropdown lists, select the source team to migrate data from, and the target team to migrate data into. Then click Continue.\n\nYou see the list of all scenarios that your source instance has. You can select the migration mode: fast or manual.\n\nNote\n\nThe Migration tool doesn't migrate scenarios that have errors: you can find them in the Non-migratable scenarios tab. If you want to move those scenarios to the target instance, you must first resolve the errors.\n\nManage your data and finish migration\n\nDepending on the migration mode you chose, you need to decide how to handle your data from the source instance. Some options are available only for the manual mode.\n\nWe highly recommend using the fast migration mode to ensure smooth and easy data transferring.\n\nSelect custom apps to replace ones that migrated scenarios use.\n\nSelect the action for connections:\n\nDuplicate a connection in the target instance.\n\nReplace a connection with the one that exists in the target instance.\n\nNote\n\nThe set of scopes or permissions of a particular connection might differ between the source and the target instance. To see the scopes of a specific connection, go to the Connection section and click the eye  icon.\n\nIf you need to extend scopes:\n\nLog in to either a source or a target instance depending on where you need to extend scopes.\n\nCreate a new scenario or open an existing one.\n\nAdd a module that requires additional scopes.\n\nCreate a new connection. Make will ask you to provide additional permissions. Click Continue.\n\nOn the app page where you're redirected to, confirm granting new scopes.\n\nOptional: Delete the module or the newly created scenario if you don't need it.\n\nSome apps allow adding scopes manually when creating a new connection. If you created a custom application in a service itself, you may extend scopes in your service account.\n\nUse a previously migrated connection.\n\nSelect the action for webhooks and mailhooks:\n\nDuplicate a webhook or mailhook.\n\nDuplicate a webhook or mailhook and forward traffic.\n\nNote\n\nWe recommend always choosing the second option. If you just duplicate a webhook or mailhook, traffic will still be sent on the webhook or mailhook that you have in the source instance, and no data will appear in the target instance.\n\nA duplicated webhook will have a different URL.\n\nIf you have linked devices in your source instance, create a mock device in the target instance.\n\nNote\n\nYou need to replace a mock device with a real device. See more information in the section below.\n\nSelect the action for data stores:\n\nDuplicate a data store and migrate its content.\n\nDuplicate a data store without its content.\n\nReplace a data store with the one that exists in the target instance.\n\nNote\n\nThe Migration tool will replace data in the data store in the target instance with data from the source instance. If you use auto-generated keys, Make will store data under different keys in the target instance.\n\nSelect the action for data structures:\n\nDuplicate a data structure.\n\nReplace a data structure with the one that exists in the target instance.\n\nSelect the action for keys:\n\nDuplicate a key.\n\nNote\n\nA duplicated key contains the relevant data, but the key ID is different.\n\nReplace a key with the one that exists in the target instance.\n\nSelect the action for folders:\n\nDuplicate a folder.\n\nReplace a folder with the one that exists in the target instance.\n\nSelect what you want to do with scenarios both in the source and target instances.\n\nImportant\n\nIf at least one scenario contains webhooks or mailhooks, Make automatically disables all migrated scenarios. You may enable them manually after migration.\n\nClick Start migration\n\nThe migration is completed. The Migration tool shows the list of scenarios and entities it migrated and confirms that the migration process was successful. Click Show log to see the migration log.\n\nIf the migration fails, the Migration tool rolls back all changes made both to the source and target instances. Check the migration log out to find out reasons for the failure.\n\nPost-migration data setup\n\nUsing the Migration tool to move your data to a different server environment ensures smooth and easy migration. Still, you must consider specific details and take certain actions after migration to fully benefit from the Enterprise plan.\n\nYour data will remain in your source instance after migration.\n\nSubscriptions and coupons\n\nMake doesn't automatically cancel your source instance subscription. After you fully set up your target instance, you need to manually cancel your subscription. After that, your source instance moves to the Free pricing plan: you can use all available features within this plan.\n\nExtra operations remain in the source instance. Contact our Support to move extra operations to the target instance.\n\nScenarios\n\nAfter migrating scenarios scheduled as immediately, they execute once the scenarios trigger receives new data.\n\nSome scenarios require additional configuration after migration. Pay attention to scenarios that contain:\n\nCustom apps: They may require additional setup.\n\nApps that require IP whitelisting: Make sure that the migrated scenarios have updated IPs in their apps.\n\nThe Make app: Create a new connection and update all IDs mapped in the app modules. New IDs should be associated with the data based on the target instance.\n\nOn-prem connections\n\nThe Migration tool doesn't migrate connections associated with connected systems and On-prem Agents. You need to manually create connections in the target instance and then link them to connected systems.\n\nWebhooks and mailhooks\n\nIf during migration you selected duplicating webhooks or mailhooks and forwarding traffic, the old URL in the source instance still receives traffic, but redirects it to the new URL in the target instance. Don't delete the old URL in order not to lose traffic. Contact our Support to receive a list of pairs of old and new URLs.\n\nDevices\n\nThe Migration tool creates mock devices in the target instance to migrate scenarios that use the iOS or Android app.\n\nNote\n\nThe mock device is called a deaf device in the target instance.\n\nAfter migration, to use such scenarios, you must:\n\nCreate a new device manually in the target instance.\n\nReplace a mock device with the newly created in all relevant scenarios.\n\nDelete all mock devices.\n\nIn this section\nMigration scope overview\nPrepare your data\nMigrate your data\nPost-migration data setup\nUpgrading to the Enterprise plan\nMigration scope overview\nWhich data can you migrate?\nWhich data can't you migrate?\nPrepare your data\nTeams\nTime zones\nScenarios\nConnections\nData stores\nCustom apps\nMigrate your data\nManage your data and finish migration\nPost-migration data setup\nSubscriptions and coupons\nScenarios\nOn-prem connections\nWebhooks and mailhooks\nDevices\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

However, the result refers to the UTC. To translate the UTC to your local time, you need to add or subtract the time zone difference between UTC and your location.\n\nFor example, let's say, you are in Prague and you want to know the current local time (9.6.2014) in New York. The trigger Get time zone information returns the Time zone offset from UTC -18000 and the Daylight Savings offset from UTC 3600. The sum of both values is -14400 seconds which is -4 hours from UTC. The result you get when repeating the same steps for Prague is +2 hours from UTC. The time difference between Prague and New York is +6 hours.\n\nGoogle Maps\nConnect Google Maps to Make\nCreate and configure a Google Cloud Console project for Google Maps\nBuild Google Maps Scenarios\nGetting the current time information\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."

Each stored incomplete execution can be resolved either manually or automatically.\n\nNote\n\nBy default the storing of incomplete executions is disabled. To enable it, enable the Allow storing incomplete executions option in the scenario advanced settings.\n\nIf a module encounters an error during its operation (see the Errors resulting in incomplete executions), a new incomplete execution is added to the Incomplete executions folder. Each incomplete execution contains the scenarios blueprint and all the bundles that can be mapped into the failed module. You can see the list of incomplete executions in the Incomplete executions tab.\n\nNote\n\nThe size limit of the unresolved incomplete executions folder per organization depends on the number of operations in your pricing plan.\n\nIf the limit is exceeded, you will get the following error:\n\nResolving incomplete executions\n\nWhen a new incomplete execution is stored, you can resolve it as follows:\n\nGo to the Incomplete executions tab.\n\nGo to the exact incomplete execution.\n\nIf you want to see the log of all module's operations first:\n\nGo to the History tab.\n\nLocate the failed execution log and click Details.\n\nClick the failing module that has an error.\n\nClick Resolve. Make redirects you to the very incomplete execution.\n\nIf you want to directly go to the incomplete execution:\n\nGo to the Incomplete executions tab.\n\nLocate the failed execution and click Details.\n\nClick the failing module. A scenario canvas opens.\n\nCheck the module settings and fix the reason for the error.\n\nClick Save.\n\nClick Run once.\n\nOptions related to incomplete executions\n\nThe following options in Make scenario settings determine if and how the incomplete executions are stored:\n\nAllow storing incomplete executions\n\nSequential processing\n\nEnable data loss\n\nErrors resulting into incomplete executions\n\nThere are several categories of errors that result into storing of incomplete executions. These may include: validation errors arising from incomplete or erroneous data, mostly because of a missing item that is expected in order to successfully process all data going through a module; or errors occurring from the final destination's unavailability because of temporary or long term connection failure (e.g. during connection to email or remote FTP server).\n\nIf an error occurs on the first module in the scenario, the execution stops immediately and no incomplete execution is stored.\n\nIf an error occurs on any other module and there is no error handler route attached, then:\n\nIf the error type is ConnectionError, RateLimitError, OutOfSpaceError or ModuleTimeoutError, an incomplete execution record WITH auto-retry is stored.\n\nIf the error type is DataError, InvalidConfigurationError, InvalidAccessTokenError, UnexpectedError, MaxFileSizeExceededError or MaxResultsExceededError, an incomplete execution record WITHOUT auto-retry is stored.\n\nIf the error type is anything other than the above, the execution fails.\n\nIn this section\nResolving incomplete executions\nOptions related to incomplete executions\nErrors resulting into incomplete executions\nIncomplete executions\nResolving incomplete executions\nOptions related to incomplete executions\nErrors resulting into incomplete executions\nPrev\nNext\n© 2024 Celonis Inc."
