The sole purpose of Yopass is to minimize the amount of passwords floating around in ticket management systems, Slack messages and emails. The message is encrypted/decrypted locally in the browser and then sent to Yopass without the decryption key which is only visible once during encryption; Yopass then returns a one-time URL with a specified expiry date.

It’s similar to Yopass and Password Pusher. This method is perfect for sharing private information inside a Facebook chat, WhatsApp chat or any other IM platform, email etc. The end-user would just click on the link and get the output in a browser. The information will be automatically deleted/destroyed at a time of your choice: as soon as the receiver reads it, after a few minutes, after a week or several months etc. Data is encrypted and decrypted in the browser using 256bit AES in Galois Counter mode. In this step by step guide I will show you how to install PrivateBin on your Synology NAS using Docker.\n\n💡Note: This guide works perfectly with the latest PrivateBin v1.6.0 release.\n\n💡Note: Check out my new guide on how to Install PrivateBin Using Portainer.\n\nSTEP 1\n\nPlease Support My work by Making a Donation.\n\nSTEP 2\n\nInstall Container Manager via Synology “Package Center”.

    "html": "🎗️Donate\nHow to Install Pi-Hole on Your Synology NAS\n2 January 2023 by Marius Bogdan Lixandru\n\nPi-Hole is a Linux network-level advertisement and Internet tracker blocking application which acts as a DNS sinkhole (and, optionally, a DHCP server), intended for use on a private network. What is a DNS sinkhole? A DNS sinkhole, also known as a sinkhole server, Internet sinkhole, or Blackhole DNS is a DNS server that gives out false information, to prevent the use of a domain name. It is designed for use on embedded devices with network capability, such as the Raspberry Pi, but it can be used on other machines running Linux like Synology NAS and cloud implementations. Pi-Hole has the ability to block traditional website adverts as well as adverts in unconventional places, such as smart TVs and mobile operating system adverts.\n\n💡Note: This guide works perfectly with the latest version of Pi-Hole v5.17.2 and DSM 7.2.1\n\n💡Note: Check out my new guide on how to Install Pi-Hole Using Portainer.\n\nI’m not a fan of applications like Pi-hole because Ad blocking software is leading to ‘the slow death of niches’ like my website. Ad blockers are white flagging Google, Amazon, Facebook and other Internet giants, but what about the small and medium publishers whose livelihood depends on ad revenues? Where is the morality in this? Anyway, my blog has no ads. See below my step by step guide on how to install Pi-Hole on your Synology NAS device. If you prefer AdGuard over Pi-Hole read my step by step guide on How to install AdGuard on your Synology NAS using docker.\n\nSTEP 1\n\nPlease Support My work by Making a Donation.\n\nSTEP 2\n\nInstall Container Manager via Synology “Package Center”. If you run an older DSM version (under 7.2), search for Docker instead of Container Manager.\n\nSTEP 3\n\nAdd Google DNS. Go to Control Panel / Network / General. Check “Manually configure DNS server” and add on Preferred DNS Server: 8.8.8.8 and on Alternative DNS Server: 8.8.4.4 Click Apply. Follow the instructions in the image below.\n\nSTEP 4\n\nGo to File Station and open the docker folder. Inside the docker folder, create one new folder and name it pihole. Follow the instructions in the image below.\nNote: Be careful to enter only lowercase, not uppercase letters.\n\nSTEP 5\n\nNow create two new folders inside the pihole folder that you previously created at STEP 4 and name them dnsmasq.d and pihole.

Click Log in. Follow the instructions in the image below.\n\nEnjoy your Pi-hole! Set it up according to your preference.\n\n\nIf you have Portainer installed on your Synology NAS you can also see the Pi-hole container perfectly running with the healthy status.\n\nThat’s it! I hope this little guide helps you install Pi-hole on your Synology NAS.\n\nNote: Many content providers (like YouTube / Reddit / Twitch / Spotify / Pandora / Facebook / Hulu) now stream/serve ads from the same servers as the content (meaning if you attempt to block the ads using a Pi-Hole you will also block the content).

Why do you need more RAM? To be more responsive! You will not use Synology NAS just for Docker. Pi-hole needs a minimum of 512 MB of RAM (I repeat, a minimum and that’s just for Pi-hole). If anyone wants to stay within the strict minimum RAM, they are welcome to, but their system will never be as responsive as those which have more RAM installed.\nNote: How to Free Disk Space on Your NAS if You Run Docker.\nNote: Some people may have problems launching Pi-Hole via Docker. This may be because of different settings in your Synology NAS and router. Every user has their own router settings etc. It’s really hard to troubleshoot the problem. You can also contact me via email and I will try to find a personalized solution for you.\nNote: After installing Pi-hole (through Docker), Synology NAS drives are not hibernating at all. The best solution is to Disable Hibernation. This will be easier and much more beneficial overall for everything Pi-hole needs to read database of filters.\nNote: Find out how to update Pi-Hole container with the latest image.\n\nFix: Pihole 403 Forbidden. If you want to use Pi-Hole with Synology Reverse Proxy, add your DDNS like you did until now, with WebSocket, then access Pi-Hole in your browser using pihole.yourname.synology.me/admin/login.php At the end of your own domain name or DDNS just add /admin/login.php\nFix: If someone has a problem once installation is completed, and gets an error like “This site can’t be reached“, open the Pi-hole GUI and go to Settings / DNS tab and in “Interface listening behavior” change to Listen on all interfaces instead of Listen only on interface eth0. (Reported by jtd).\nFix: If your Pi-hole container keeps disconnecting, uninstall the Synology Package named “DNS Server” or “DHCP Server” which conflicts with Pi-hole on port 53 and doesn’t let your Pi-hole start.\nFix: If your Pi-hole container gets a DNS service not running, uninstall the Synology Package named “DNS Server” or “DHCP Server” which conflicts with Pi-hole on port 53 and doesn’t let your DNS work.\nFix: If you experience connections problems, remember to set your Synology Firewall in Control Panel / Security / Firewall / Edit Rules / Create Firewall Rules and allow Custom Port 53 Protocol All.\nFix: If you can’t play videos from CNN, in the PiHole whitelist add the following address: c.amazon-adsystem.com\nFix: How can I make Pi-Hole work over VPN connection? Go to Pi-Hole / Settings / DNS tab / Interface Settings / choose Permit all origins the scroll down the page all the way and click Save. Follow the instructions in the image below.\n\nFix: If you want to run the DHCP server on docker with pi-hole, just add the cap-admin directive as per the instructions below.\n\ndocker run -d --name=pihole \\\n-e WEB_PORT=8080 \\\n-e WEBPASSWORD=mariushosting \\\n-e WEB_BIND_ADDR=192.168.1.18 \\\n-e TZ=Europe/Bucharest \\\n-e DNSMASQ_USER=root  \\\n-e DNSMASQ_LISTENING=local \\\n-v /volume1/docker/pihole/dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d \\\n-v /volume1/docker/pihole/pihole:/etc/pihole \\\n--cap-add=NET_ADMIN \\\n--net=host \\\n--restart always \\\npihole/pihole\n\nCLICK TO COPY 🐋\n\nNote: Can I run Docker on my Synology NAS? See the supported models.\nNote: At STEP 7 you can also change the value variable for the: WEB_PORT – 8080 to 1010 or whatever you want.\nNote: How to Schedule Start & Stop For Docker Containers.\nNote: How to Activate Email Notifications.\nNote: How to Add Access Control Profile on Your NAS.\nNote: How to Change Docker Containers Restart Policy.\nNote: How to Use Docker Containers With VPN.\nNote: Convert Docker Run Into Docker Compose.\nNote: How to Clean Docker.\nNote: How to Clean Docker Automatically.\nNote: Best Practices When Using Docker and DDNS.\nNote: Some Docker Containers Need WebSocket.\nNote: Find out the Best NAS Models For Docker.\nNote: Activate Gmail SMTP For Docker Containers.\n\nThis post was updated on Thursday / October 12th, 2023 at 1:25 PM\n\n🧡 I Need Your Help!"

It is a highly optimized monitoring agent you install on all your systems and containers. Netdata provides unparalleled insights, in real-time, of everything happening on the systems it runs on (including web servers, databases, applications), using highly interactive web dashboards. It can run autonomously, without any third party components, or it can be integrated to existing monitoring toolchains (Prometheus, Graphite, OpenTSDB, Kafka, Grafana etc). Netdata is fast and efficient, designed to permanently run on all systems (physical & virtual servers, containers, IoT devices), without disrupting their core function. Netdata is free, open-source software and it currently runs smoothly on Synology NAS, Linux, FreeBSD, and MacOS. Are you tired of complicated guides? Do you want something quick and easy?

In Traggo there are no tasks, only tagged time spans. With tags, Traggo tries to be as customizable as possible, for example, if you work on different projects you could add a project-tag. If you like to see statistics from the different things you do, you could add a type-tag with values like email, programming, meeting. You can do it just as you like.

The notes are searchable, can be copied, tagged and modified either from the applications directly or from your own text editor. The notes are in Markdown format. Notes exported from Evernote via .enex files can be imported into Joplin, including the formatted content (which is converted to Markdown), resources (images, attachments, etc.) and complete metadata (geolocation, updated time, created time, etc.). Plain Markdown files can also be imported. The notes can be synchronized with various cloud services including Nextcloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, WebDAV or the file system (for example with a network directory). When synchronizing the notes, notebooks, tags and other metadata are saved to plain text files which can be easily inspected, backed up and moved around.

With Watchtower you can update the running version of your docker container app simply by pushing a new image to the Docker Hub or your own image registry. Watchtower will pull down your new image, gracefully shut down your existing container and restart it with the same options that were used when it was deployed initially. ⚠️Warning: Watchtower will do upgrades of your docker containers automatically. This means that, if a docker image has a bug, it might destroy some containers you already have installed.

With Dockge you can easily manage your compose.yaml files, providing a central point for all your Docker configuration needs. Includes options to create, edit, start, stop, restart, and delete Docker configurations, offering full lifecycle management of your Docker environments. In this step by step guide I will show you how to install Dockge on your Synology NAS using Docker.\n\n💡Note: This guide works perfectly with the latest Dockge v1.2.0 release.\n\nSTEP 1\n\nPlease Support My work by Making a Donation.\n\nSTEP 2\n\nInstall Container Manager via Synology “Package Center”. If you run an older DSM version (under 7.2), search for Docker instead of Container Manager.\n\nSTEP 3\n\nGo to File Station and open the docker folder. Inside the docker folder create a new folder and name it dockge. Follow the instructions in the images below.\nNote: Be careful to use only lowercase, not uppercase letters.\n\nSTEP 4\n\nNow create two new folders inside the dockge folder that you previously created at STEP 3 and name them data and stacks. Follow the instructions in the image below.\nNote: Be careful to enter only lowercase, not uppercase letters.\n\nSTEP 5\n\nIn the stacks folder that you have previously created at STEP 4, create folders for every docker container that you have a compose.yaml file for. For example, I created a folder named Dozzle for the Dozzle container.\n\nThen, in the dozzle folder, I uploaded the compose.yaml file that I provide at STEP 9 in my Dozzle article. Repeat this operation for every container that you have a compose.yaml file for. First create the folder, then upload the compose.yaml file in it. For every container, the file name should be called compose.yaml – Only the folder should have a different name. Example: For the Dozzle container, create a folder called dozzle and upload the compose.yaml file in it. For the Calibre container, create a folder called calibre and upload the compose.yaml file in it. And so on.\n\n\nWhat is compose? With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. Do this operation for every container that you have a compose.yaml file for.\n\nSTEP 6\n\nGo to Control Panel / Task Scheduler / Create / Scheduled Task / User-defined script. Follow the instructions in the image below.\n\nSTEP 7\n\nOnce you click on User-defined script a new window will open.

It will depend on your Internet speed connection. Now open your browser and type in http://Synology-ip-address:5571 Type in your details then click Create. Follow the instructions in the image below.\n\nSTEP 12\n\nIn the Dockge left sidebar you will see all your compose folders. For example, you can start the installation for Dozzle by clicking Start. First of all, in file station, you will need to create the dozzle folder following the same exact STEPs that you used in Portainer before deploying the Dozzle stack. Note: If you see different stacks on the left sidebar, the stacks that are marked “active”, but greyed out, will be the ones created outside Dockge. For example, the stacks created with Portainer. You can just switch to Dockge gradually in the future, if you want. Follow the instructions in the image below.\n\nSTEP 13\n\nOnce you click the Start button at STEP 12, your container installation will be deployed. Click the port to open it. Follow the instructions in the image below.\n\nSTEP 14\n\nAs you can see, you can now access Dozzle.\n\nEnjoy Dockge!\n\n🆘TROUBLESHOOTING\n\nIf you encounter issues by using this container, make sure to check out the Common Docker issues article.\n\nNote: If you want to run the Dockge container over HTTPS, check How to Run Docker Containers Over HTTPS.

    "html": "🎗️Donate\nSynology: Common Docker Issues and Fixes\n3 March 2023 by Marius Bogdan Lixandru\n\nOn mariushosting I have always wanted to create Docker guides that are compatible with most Synology NAS devices. I have made great efforts in this direction over the years and, thanks to your emails and posts and messages on Discord, I have been able to compile a list of common problems that most users experience when installing some Docker containers. Not all Synology NAS devices are the same when it comes to getting Docker containers to work, even though they allow you to install Docker. Below is a list of common problems you can face when you’re running Docker containers on your Synology NAS, and some great solutions to solve these problems.\n\n💡Karma\n\nIn all the Docker guides present on mariushosting you will find STEP 1 which says Please Support My work by Making a Donation. Almost 99,9% of the people that install something using my guides forget to support my work, or just ignore STEP 1. I’ve been very honest about this aspect of my work since the beginning: I don’t run any ADS, I don’t require subscriptions, paid or otherwise, I don’t collect IPs, emails, and I don’t have any referral links from Amazon or other merchants. I also don’t have any POP-UPs or COOKIES. The main reason for this is because I want to offer a clean, safe and pleasant user experience to anyone coming to mariushosting. And I truly think it’s important we have this kind of experience in today’s online climate where you never truly know if what you’re reading is genuine content anymore. But for this I require your support. I do self-host so I have devices running 24/7/365. I do all the technical support work, admin work, I test and create content, from informing you of what’s new to providing complex technical tutorials with images and exact instructions and code that I specifically make work for this type of devices, take care of security and all other kinds of updates, and work to improve user experience all the time. But I need to be supported to be able to continue doing this kind of work. I have repeatedly been told over the years how much I have contributed to the community. It’s something I love doing and have been honest about my passion since the beginning. But I also Need The Community to Support me Back to be able to continue doing this work.\n\n💡Clean your Docker\n\nSometimes, when you’re installing a Docker container on your Synology NAS, you can run into issues with getting said Docker container to run. This usually occurs when you are using different tutorials from several sources, or when you attempt to install a Docker container several times. Or when you’re not using a tutorial from mariushosting. You can experience different kinds of issues and get error messages like: [Warning] Access denied for user ‘root’@’localhost’ (using password: YES). To fix issues like this, you need to follow all the STEPS in my How to Clean Docker tutorial. Many Docker images and containers that you install on your Synology NAS following various guides on the web leave traces in your system that should be deleted so that future installations may work flawlessly.\n\n💡MariaDB issues\n\nAs you know, I’m always busy working on testing new Dockers for your Synology NAS. Aside from the high volume of work this process entails, and the headaches that come with it, getting the Docker containers to run flawlessly also means I get to discover important pieces of information. For instance, in the past few months I have found that some mariaDB Docker images are not fully compatible with all Synology NAS devices, like the mariaDB image from Linuxserver and the original one. So because this version does not work flawlessly for some Synology NAS devices, I have replaced all the mariaDB Docker images in my Docker guides that required it with mariadb:jammy – This version is the version for Ubuntu servers and it appears to fix all connection issues reported by various users over the years; it’s also fully compatible with Docker containers that require mariaDB as a database.\n\n⚠️Warning: mariaDB reached version 11 in June 2023. So, if you have a Docker compose that uses mariadb:jammy, know that the old healthcheck will no longer work which will cause your database to be unhealthy. So you need to delete the whole healthcheck part from the mariadb:jammy Example of healthcheck to remove:\n\n healthcheck:\n   test: [\"CMD-SHELL\", \"mysqladmin ping -u root -prootpass | grep 'mysqld is alive' || exit 1\"]\nCLICK TO COPY 🐋\n\nNote: All my Docker tutorials that use mariadb:jammy have already been updated to reflect the change.\n\n💡Synology NAS Firewall Issues\n\nSometimes, when you try to install a Docker container on your Synology NAS, you may get error messages in your Docker container logs that say “permission issue“, “connection refused“, “permission denied“, aborted connection“, “disconnected due to malformed packet“, “db unhealthy” or “unable to connect“. Most of these issues can easily be fixed by properly configuring your Synology NAS Firewall. Be especially careful when you configure RULE 1, RULE 5 and RULE 6 in my article that explains How to Correctly Set Up Firewall on DSM 7.\n\n💡The data directory was initialized by PostgreSQL version 15, which is not compatible with this version 16.0\n\nIf you use software like Watchtower that automatically updates containers, you may encounter some issue in the future. If you get the error “The data directory was initialized by PostgreSQL version 15, which is not compatible with this version 16.0“, you will need to change the following line in your docker compose image: postgres to image: postgres:15 then update the stack in Portainer. If this does not solve the issue, you will have to reinstall your favorite containers from scratch or restore a previously made backup of the docker folders. On mariushosting, most database container images use the tag :latest which means that the mariadb or postgres database will be automatically updated if you use watchtower or do manual updates using Container Manager. This could cause issues when upgrading to a major database version.\n\n💡Pi-Hole & AdGuard\n\nSome people may have problems installing or running some Docker containers if they have special configurations for Pi-Hole or AdGuard. Try to temporarily disable Pi-Hole and Adguard and check if your connection issues were not due to the Synology Firewall, but rather to your Pi-Hole or Adguard configurations. If this is the case, just whitelist the domains that are used for a specific Docker container in Pi-hole or Adguard.\n\n💡Wrong UID and GID\n\nAs it so happens, many users forget to add their PUID and PGID values to the Docker containers that require them. Always make sure the PUID and PGID number values that you add are your own. Use my easy tutorial to find your own UID (userID) and GID (groupID) in 5 Seconds.\n\n💡1 for True 0 for False\n\nWhen you deploy a stack, some NAS devices can get the following error message: ERROR: The Compose file ‘./docker-compose.yml’ is invalid because:\nservices.CONTAINERNAME.environment.CONTAINERNAME_READONLY contains false or true which is an invalid type, it should be a string, number, or a null. Note: Change from true to 1 and from false to 0. In short, change all values for the environment variables in the code that have ENVEXAMPLE: false or true with ENVEXAMPLE: 0 for false or 1 for true.\n\n💡Wrong Folder Permissions in File Station\n\nI still don’t know how this is possible, but some users have a different owner than the one stated in their UID and GID values on their Docker Folder. Right click on the folder for the Docker container, then Properties. Go to the General tab and make sure the folder has the “original” owner. Be sure to check Apply to this folder, sub-folder and files, then click Save.\n\n💡Outdated Synology NAS Kernel under Version 4\n\nSome Docker containers will not run on an older Linux Kernel, usually a Linux kernel version older than version 4. So if you have a Synology NAS device with, say, Linux Kernel 3.x then you will get the following error message for some Docker Containers: AH00141: Could not initialize random number generator. To fix this, you need a new Synology NAS that supports Linux Kernel 4.x. You can use my tutorial on How to Check Linux Kernel Version on your Synology NAS to find out what is your Linux Kernel version. If your Kernel is a version 3.x, then you can’t install some Docker containers, even if your NAS supports Docker. This aspect should be improved by Synology because it is not right for NAS owners to have a NAS that technically supports Docker, but which doesn’t support all Docker because of the outdated Kernel.\n\n💡Increase Reverse Proxy Timeout in Seconds\n\nIf you experience issues when installing some Docker containers that require the installation of a database, like the PrestaShop Docker container, Snipe-IT Docker container, OrangeHRM Docker Container, BudgetBee and your NAS system is slow, for whatever cause, then you can increase your reverse proxy timeout in seconds to fix the issue. Go to Control Panel / Login Portal / Advanced tab / Reverse Proxy / select the container you want to modify, then click the Edit tab / Advanced Settings tab. Increase the Proxy connection timeout to 600 seconds instead of 60. Increase the Proxy send timeout from 60 to 600 seconds and the Proxy read timeout from 60 to 600 seconds. Click Save to save the settings.\n\n💡Outdated CPU without AVX Support\n\nHave you ever gotten this error message with some Dockers that require the mongo database? WARNING: MongoDB 5.0+, MongoDB 6.0 requires a CPU with AVX support, and your current system does not appear to have that! stderr – If you have also received this message, know that it means that your NAS CPU does not support AVX. Some Docker containers cannot be installed on some NAS models with outdated CPUs that do not have AVX support. Advanced Vector Extensions, AVX for short, are extensions to the x86 instruction set architecture for microprocessors from Intel and AMD Advanced Micro Devices. To help provide a fix for this, I have written a guide to help you to choose the BEST Synology NAS device for Docker.\n\n💡Docker Containers Work on Localhost, but Not Via HTTPS\n\nIf some Docker containers run well on your localhost, but you experience issues when you create a Reverse Proxy to access them online, most of the time you forgot to activate Web Socket.\n\n💡I Can’t Access My DDNS Address From Within Network\n\nCan you access your Synology NAS via DDNS address from outside your local network, but can’t access it from within your own network? Many users face this very common issue: they are unable to connect to their NAS-hosted website, their DDNS, directly from their local network, but they can easily connect from outside their local network. Why is that?\n\nMany routers/modems/gpon devices that are provided by ISPs lack the NAT loopback feature and there are four solutions if you find yourself in this situation:\n\nCall your ISP and tell them to give you a compatible modem/router that supports NAT loopback.\nCall your ISP and tell them to put your actual gpon/modem/router in bridge mode so you can use your own router that supports the NAT loopback feature.\nIf they are unable to help you, you have only one solution: change your ISP.\nAdvanced: You can configure your ISP router to use your Synology NAS as the default DNS (for example 192.168.1.3) for DHCP by installing the DNS Server package from Package Center on your Synology NAS and configuring “https://myaccount.synology.me” to be an A record to 192.168.1.3\n\nNote: Hairpinning or NAT loopback is a feature which allows the access of a service via the WAN IP address from within your local network. For example, you have a web server hosted on your Synology NAS on your local network or an active DDNS like the synology.me service. The web server is accessible from the outside via a public IP that is assigned to it. However, if you required local users to access this web server address using the same public IP address instead of its local IP address, they couldn’t because your router would need to support the NAT loopback feature.\nNote: All Synology routers support the NAT loopback feature.\nNote: ISP (Internet Service Provider).\n\nThis post was updated on Sunday / September 17th, 2023 at 12:37 PM\n\n🧡 I Need Your Help!"

He loves writing technical guides that are accessible for non-technical people. Born on April 13, 1984, he has always expressed interest in technology. Beyond technology and biology, he has a passion for agriculture, the science and beauty of which have encouraged him to start his own vegetable garden and plant dozens of fruit-bearing trees with fragrant and succulent, sweet and sour fruits. When he’s not losing nights uncovering the deepest hidden secrets of the latest tech devices, he’s likely enjoying a refreshing slice of juicy, honey-sweet watermelon, sluggishly lying on the grass in his orchard, sitting in the shade under the trees he himself has planted. Torpid summer days accompanied by cicada sounds and greeted by his smiling wife and happy, tail-wagging presence of his two mioritic shepherd dogs are some of the simpler pleasures in life that help him recharge his batteries to take on the latest tech challenges. Support My Work & Feel free to contact me. Read from where it all started.\n\nOn November 28, 2020 my beloved Mioritic Shepherd girl dog Luna, passed away at the age of 4 and left a great void in my heart. Her photos will remain on this blog forever. Luna was with me when I bought my first Synology NAS. It is a pain that cannot be explained."
