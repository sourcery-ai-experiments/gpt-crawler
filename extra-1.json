With Divi, you can build stunning websites from the ground up without touching a single line of code (unless you want to!). Divi harnesses the power of complex web development and lets you design custom websites by using the Divi Visual Builder so you can see the changes you are making in real time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW A DEMO\n\nAll Divi Builder Settings and Features Explained\n\nLet’s explore all of the features, settings, and functionality available within the Divi Visual Builder.\n\nHow To Load The Visual Builder\n\nOnce you have Divi installed on your website, you’ll be able to access the Visual Builder on every page of your website. To do so, navigate to any page and click “Enable Visual Builder” on the top admin bar.\n\nCreating a New Page and Enabling the Visual Builder\n\nTo start fresh on a blank page, navigate to your WordPress dashboard and click Page > Add New.\n\nGive your page a title, then click “Use Divi Builder”. This will re-load the page onto the front end of the website with the Divi Visual Builder enabled.\n\nAs your page reloads, you’ll notice three options that come up: Build From Scratch, Choose A Premade Layout, and Clone An Existing Page.\n\nBuild From Scratch\n\nThis option loads the Divi Builder with a blank page design. Choose this option if you’d like to start your page design from scratch.\n\nChoose a Premade Layout\n\nIf you’d like to start your design with one of your saved layouts or a premade layout pack from Divi, choose this option. It will load the Divi Library where you can browse premade layout packs, your previously saved designs, and existing pages on your website.\n\nClone an Existing Page\n\nYou can also start your design by cloning an existing page on your website. Select this option if you’d like to load a page design from an existing page on your website as your starting point.\n\nSelect, Build From Scratch.\n\nBy default, a standard section is automatically added to the page.\n\nDivi Visual Builder Basics\n\nLet’s start with the basics. The building blocks of Divi. The main building blocks of Divi are sections, rows, columns, and modules. Sections contain rows, which contain columns, which contain modules.\n\nSections\n\nIn Divi, everything you build starts with a section. Sections are the biggest building block in the Divi builder. You can think of them as horizontal stacking blocks that can group your content into visually distinguishable areas. This content wrapper has various settings that can be used to do some really awesome things.\n\nThere are three types of sections: Standard, Fullwidth, and Specialty.\n\nStandard Sections\n\nStandard sections are the most commonly used section within Divi. It expands to the width of the browser and contains a row that is set to 80% width by default. However, there is a lot of customization options available within the standard section to get it to do whatever you want.\n\nFullwidth Sections\n\nFullwidth sections give you access to a set of Fullwidth Modules. These modules act a little differently because they take advantage of the full width of the browser. Fullwidth modules can only be placed within Fullwidth sections.\n\nSpecialty Sections\n\nSpecialty sections allow for more advanced column structures. When you select “Specialty” you’ll see all the available column structures available.\n\nUnlike normal sections, when you use a specialty section, you can add complex column variations next to full-spanning vertical sidebars, without adding unwanted breaks to the page. These types of layouts are not possible using normal sections. Below is an example of a Speciality Section in action.\n\nRows\n\nRows are nested inside sections and can contain a variety of column layouts that help structure your content. Learn More: A Complete Overview of Divi Rows & Columns\n\nColumns\n\nColumns are nested inside rows and create a basic boxed structure for your content. Every row has a column, even if it’s just one column.\n\nLearn More: A Complete Overview of Divi Rows & Columns\n\nModules\n\nModules are the content blocks of Divi. So Contact Forms, Images, Text, Sliers, Blurbs and more are all examples of modules. Check out all the modules Divi has to offer here. To learn how to use the modules check out our Module Documentation.\n\nParent / Child Element Hierarchy in Divi Builder Elements\n\nWhen adjusting settings and applying styles in Divi it’s important to remember the hierarchy of Divi’s sections, rows, columns, and modules. Sections contain rows, rows contain columns, and columns contain modules. These are called parent and child elements. Child elements are nested inside parent elements and are affected by any design styling you apply to the parent element.\n\nThe Element Settings Window Pop-Up\n\nWhenever you open an element’s settings, a window will pop up with all of the content, design, and advanced settings available to that element. Let’s take a closer look at what’s available.\n\nName of the Element\n\nAt the top left you’ll see the name of the builder element you’re working on. That could be a section, row, column, module, page settings, etc. If you ever get confused about what element you’re currently editing, look here and it will tell you!\n\nPresets\n\nUnderneath the name of the module is where you can access Global Presets. Click on the dropdown to load a saved preset, create a new preset, or delete a preset. Presets are pre-designed and saved settings for any section, row, column, or module within Divi. Learn all about Global Presets here.\n\nExpand Modal\n\nThe next icon expands the modal to the width of your browser.\n\nSnap or Separate Modal\n\nThe next icon either snaps or separates the modal. Snap affixes the modal to the left of your browser window and does not hover over your page’s content, but adjusts next to it. To exit the left sidebar position of the snapped modal, click the icon again and it will separate and return to the position it was before.\n\nOther Settings\n\nWhen clicked, the three vertical ellipses icon gives you access to even more settings for that element.\n\nSave To Libray – Saves this element to your library.\n\nSave To Divi Cloud – Saves this element to your Divi Cloud.\n\nSplit Test – Conduct a split test with this modal. Learn how to split test here.\n\nDisable – Quickly disable the element on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device. When an icon is green that means it’s visible. When it’s red, it’s hidden.a\n\nLock – Locks the element so no design styles and settings are changed. To unlock, right-click on the element and click “Unlock”.\n\nCopy Module – Copies the module to your clipboard so you can paste it anywhere on the page.\nCopy Module Styles – Copies the module’s styles and settings so you can apply them to another same module.\n\nPaste Button One Styles – Pastes styles from the button. This will only take effect if you have copied the styles first by clicking the above option “Copy Module Styles”.\n\nReset Module Styles – Resets the module’s styles to the default styling. This removes any customization you did to the module.\n\nPaste Module – After you’ve copied the module, click this to paste the module anywhere on your website. For this to work, you must first click “Copy Module”.\n\nView Modified Styles – Selecting this option will only display the settings of that module that have been modified. This is helpful when you’ve made a lot of changes or you’ve forgotten which changes you’ve made because it quickly shows the settings that have been modified within that module allowing you to make fast updates.\n\nExtend Button Styles – When extending a module’s styles you have the option to extend those styles throughout the entire page including headers and footers, just the page design, just the section, just the row, or just the column that module is in.\n\nApply Styles To Active Preset –\n\nEdit Preset Style – Selecting this option will allow you to access the current preset’s settings and stylings.\n\nGo To Layer – Once clicked, the Layers panel will open up and go to the layer that the design element is in. This is helpful to quickly access builder elements to access their settings, rearrange them, and more.\n\n\nYou can also access these settings by right-clicking on the design element you’re working on. When right-clicking to access these settings, you’ll notice Undo and Redo are added at the top of the list. This is handy for when you want to quickly undo or redo a certain action.\n\nSearch Options Bar\n\nNext in the module window is the Search Bar. You can use the search back to quickly find and access settings and styles. Simply type what you’re looking for to search.\n\n+ Filter\n\nThe filter button works similarly to the search function in that it allows you to quickly access modified styles, responsive styles, hover state styles, and active content.\n\nTabs: Content, Design, Advanced.\n\nAll modal windows have three tabs: Content, Design, and Advanced. This is where the content settings, design settings, and advanced settings are for any Divi Builder element you’re working on (whether that be a section, row, columnn, or module).\n\nContent\n\nThe Content tab is where you can adjust the content settings of the Divi Builder element you’re working on. What’s in the Content tab varies depending on which element you are working on.\n\nDesign\n\nThe Design tab is where you can adjust the design settings for the Divi Builder element you are working on.\n\nAdvanced\n\nThe Advanced tab is where you can access the advanced settings for whatever Divi Builder element you’re working on. Settings like Custom CSS, Visibility, Scroll Effects, Conditions, and more.\n\nBottom Buttons: Exit, Undo, Redo, Save.\n\nAt the bottom of the modal window, you’ll see 4 buttons from left to right: Exit (red), Undo (purple), Redo (blue), and Save (green).\n\nExit – If you exit the modal window without saving your changes first, they will be lost.\nUndo – Undoes previous actions.\nRedo – Redoes undone actions.\nSave – Click this button to save your settings.\n\nTour the Divi Visual Builder\n\nIn this section, we’ll review the interface of the Divi Visual Builder and explain what each option does.\n\nBottom Divi Toolbar\n\nThe bottom toolbar is where you can access a variety of settings. Let’s look at what each of these icons means.\n\nLeftside of the Toolbar\n\nWe’ll start from the left, and work our way to the right side of the Divi toolbar.\n\nThree Dots: Builder Settings\n\nClick the three docs to access settings that customize the Divi Builder interface. Here you can customize what icons are on the bottom toolbar, the Builder default view mode, the modal default position, and more.\n\nCustomize Builder Settings Toolbar\n\nHere you can choose to show or hide icons on the toolbar for quick access. Simply click the icon to show or hide it on the toolbar.\n\n\nFrom left to right the icons are:\nWireframe View – Click to view the wireframe layout of the page you are working on.\n\nZoom in / Zoom Out – Click this icon to zoom in or out on your page design.\n\nDesktop View – Click this to realize the Builder window to the size of a Desktop computer.\nTablet View – Click this to realize the Builder window to the size of tablet devices.\nMobile View – Click this to realize the Builder window to the size of mobile devices.\n\nHover Mode – When the hover mode is one, the element settings toolbar shows on hover, rather than on-click.\nClick Mode – When the click mode is on, the element settings toolbar will show on-click, rather than on-hover.\nGrid Mode – When gride mode is on, all of the element settings toolbars and containers will be visible without having to hover or click on them.\n\nHistory State Interval\n\nThe History State Interval determines how often Divi auto-saves your page design. You can choose it to auto-save after every action you take, or every 10, 20, 30, or 40 actions.\n\nSettings Modal Default Position\n\nHere you can set the default position of the modal when it’s opened.\n\nYou can choose from Last Used Position, Floating Minimum Size, Fullscreen, Fixed Left Sidebar, Fixed Right Sidebar, or Fixed Bottom Panel.\n\nPage Creation Flow\n\nHere you can choose how new pages are loaded. You can choose for the page to load as a build-from-scratch page, or with the Divi Library window open, by cloning an existing page, or with the three options presented with Give Me a Choice.\n\nBuilder Interface Animations\n\nToggle this option on or off to enable or disable the Divi Builder animations that happen when you click an object.\nimg\n\nShow Disabled Modules at 50% Opacity\n\nToggle this option on to show disabled modules at 50% opacity. Disabled modules are modules that are hidden from view depending on what device is being used (desktop, tablet, or mobile). When you’re working within the Visual Builder, it’s helpful to have disabled modules displayed at 50% opacity so you know they are disabled for the view just by looking at them.\n\nIf this option is toggled off, then the disabled element will not show in the view mode it’s disabled on. For example, below I have the image module disabled on Desktop view and the show disabled modules at 50% opacity setting off. The result is the image is not showing.\n\nGroup Settings Into Closed Toggles\n\nWhen this setting is toggled on it will show module settings as closed toggles. If this setting is toggled off it will show the module settings as open toggles.\n\nAdd Placeholder Content to New Modules\n\nThis option allows you to choose whether or not you want modules to display placeholder content when you add them to your page. If you toggle this option off, new modules added to your page will not display placeholder content, as shown below.\n\nTheme Builder Template Editing\n\nThis setting allows you to choose whether or not you’d like to be able to edit Theme Builder templates in the Visual Builder. If you only want those templates to be editable through the dashboard Theme Builder, then toggle this option off.\n\nMiddle Toolbar Section\n\nNow let’s look at the icons in the middle section of the Divi Toolbar.\n\n\nLoad From Library\n\nThe plus icon loads the Divi Library when clicked. Here you have three choices: Premade Layouts, Your Saved Layouts, or Clone an Existing Page.\n\nPremade Layouts\nDivi comes packed with hundreds of free Layout Packs designed by our in-house design team just for you! If you’d like to use a pre-made layout on your page, click the Premade Layouts tab at the top of the Divi Library window and browse through the hundreds of available designs. You can even use the sidebar on the left to filter through categories or the search bar to find what you’re looking for.\n\nLearn More: How to Use a Premade Layout Pack on Your Divi Website.\n\nYour Saved Lyouts\nIn this section, you can load any layouts you have saved to your library and from your Divi Cloud. Click the “Your Saved Layouts” tab to view your saved layouts and use the sidebar options to sort and filter through your saved layouts.

Then click “Exit Visual Builder” on the top toolbar to exist the Visual Builder.\n\nDivi Builder Capabilities\n\nLet’s take a look at what you can do with the Divi Builder!\n\nDivi Gives You Complete Design Control\n\nDivi isn’t just a WordPress theme, it’s a complete design framework that allows you to design and customize every part of your website from the ground up. You have control over everything down to the finest detail. Create the perfect websites for you and your clients. Explore all the design features that Divi has to offer!\n\nResponsive Editing\n\nMaking responsive websites is easy with Divi. Divi is responsive by default but takes responsive design a step further by giving you complete control over every design setting on each mobile device. This allows you to perfectly tailor the appearance of each element on computers, tablets and smartphones.\n\nLet’s explore some of the core features that makes Divi, Divi!\n\nEssential Features of the Divi Visual Builder\n\nLet’s take a look at the essential features of Divi’s Visual Builder and what’s available to you at your fingertips.\n\nDesign Visually on the Front End\n\nWith Divi’s Visual Builder, you’re able to drag and drop elements, format text, resize design elements, adjust responsive sizing, and show or hide elements based on the device being used.\n\nThe Theme Builder\n\nDivi’s Theme Builder is a powerful way to build your website templating system using the power of Divis’ Visual Builder to design your website’s header, footer, product templates, blog post templates, category pages, project templates, 404 page, and more.\n\nDrag and Drop to Move and Resize Elements\n\nWith Divi, you’re able to design complex layouts by dragging and dropping elements on the front end. That way you can see how your changes look visually before saving and publishing your design. You can also resize elements on your website by dragging the sides of the elements to adjust settings like height, width, padding, and margins.\n\nCopy and Paste Styles\n\nIn Divi, anything can be copied from one element and pasted onto another. You can copy individual settings, groups of settings or even copy an element’s entire design and transfer it to another element on the page. No need to open up design settings and edit things over and over again. Design it once, and then just copy and paste.\n\nExtendable Stlyes\n\nIf you have a design style that you just created, and you want to use that elsewhere on the page, or even across the entire page, you can simply extend that style automatically to your desired location. Update hundreds of elements at once! Control exactly where and to which elements your styles should be extended to. For example, let’s say you just crafted the perfect button style, but you have dozens of buttons on the page. You can extend that style to the rest of the buttons instantly by extending the style.\n\nKeyboard Shortucts\n\nKeyboard shorcuts are the key to ultimate efficiency. Divi comes with a full range of keyboard shortcuts that advanced users can use to speed up their work flow significantly. Once you get the hang of using shortcuts, you will wonder how you ever lived without them!\n\nMulti-Select & Bulk Editing\n\nIf you want to edit multiple elements at one time like a group of images, then use Divi’s multi-select bulk editing capabilities! To select multiple elements press Cmd or Ctrl and click each element you want to edit on the page at once. You can then edit these elements at the same time, changing their style and content together or moving them to different locations on the page as a group.\n\nFind & Replace Styles\n\nMake sweeping changes across your entire page instantly, saving you hours upon hours of editing time. Using find and replace allows you to change any design value, such as colors or fonts, across the entire page or within specific locations. Instead of opening up each element individually and changing colors over and over again, just find and replace across the entire document.\n\nGlobal Website Styles\n\nCustomize your website with its own overarching design system by editing the default design of any element. When you modify a module’s default design, it updates across your whole website at once. Site-wide theme building plus site-wide design editing is the ultimate combo.\n\nGlobal Website Colors\n\nDivi lets you create a global color palette for your website. These global colors are dynamic and can be changed at any time. This allows you to quickly transform your website’s color scheme in just a few moments.\n\nAdvanced Code Editing\n\nWhile you don’t need to know code to use Divi, you still have the option to write and edit code if you desire! Divi comes with a a fully-featured code editor that makes writing and editing code so much easier and enjoyable. Features include syntax highlighting, error reporting, auto-complete, color picking, multi-line select, search, find and replace and more. Add custom CSS to any element or add your own code to any page using the Divi code module or Page Settings Custom CSS area.\n\nBuild Your Design Library\n\nEach installation of Divi comes with access to the Divi Library where you can save design elements, page layouts, headers and footers, and more for easy access when you’re building websites. Divi also comes with thousands of premade layouts you can use any time!\n\nGlobal Elements and Dynamic Content\n\nWith Divi, you’re able to save builder elements (sections, rows, modules) as global designs across your website. That means whenever you update a global element, it will automatically synch those changes anywhere else that element appears on your website, saving you time and headaches! Divi also has the capability to display dynamic content (like your logo, a blog post’s title, search results, and more) so that you can spend less time editing every single page and instead make changes with one click.\n\nMobile and Wireframe View Modes\n\nThere are multiple ways to build with Divi. You can freely switch between different view modes, choosing the one that best suits you or your current project. Zoom in and out, toggle through mobile device views, switch between unique interaction modes or build your page structures quickly in wire-frame mode. It’s up to you.\n\nHistory, Auto Saves & Browser Backups\n\nDivi has your back. Every action you perform while building is saved into your editing history. You can undo, redo and explore revisions with ease. If something goes wrong, like your internet going down or your computer crashing, Divi will automatically save your progress so that you can restore it.\n\nRight Click Options\n\nDivi also comes with powerful right-click options that make designing even faster! Learn all about what’s possible with Divi’s right-click options here.\n\nDivi Builder Best Tips & Practices\n\nThere are many ways to use Divi in your design business and each Divi designer and developer will have their own method and workflow that works for them and we encourage you to find what process works best for you! However, we have a few recommendations on ways you can maximize Divi, simplify your workflow, and streamline your design processes.\n\nSwitch Back and Forth Between Visual Builder & Wireframe Mode\n\nOne of the great things about Divi’s Visual Builder is that it’s easy to switch between editing on the frontend and editing on the backend. Changing between both views takes literally less than one second. Switching between viewing your design on the frontend and viewing the wireframe layout can help you quickly drag and drop elements and view the structure of your design.\n\nUse the Zoom Out Feature\n\nI’m sure you’ve done it too – taken a screen shot of your page design to see how everything looks together. The Zoom icon on the Divi toolbar allows you to quickly take a bird’s eye view of your design instead of having to save, exit, and take a screenshot.\n\nDivi Builder Resources\n7 Divi UX Best Practices You Should Keep in Mind\n7 Practical Tips for the Divi Theme Builder\nDivi Keyboard Shortcuts\nContinue Learning\nDivi Theme Options\nDivi Library\nBrowse Divi Documentation"

Some pages may have different URL’s all leading to the same place. For example domain.com, domain.com/index.html, and www.domain.com are all different URLs leading to your homepage. From a search engine’s perspective these duplicate URLs, which also occur often due to custom permalinks, may be treaded individually instead of as a single destination. Defining a canonical URL tells the search engine which URL you would like to use officially. The theme bases its canonical URLs off your permalinks and the domain name defined in the settings tab of wp-admin.\n\nEnable meta descriptions\n\nCheck this box if you want to display meta descriptions on category/archive pages. The description is based off the category description you choose when creating/edit your category in wp-admin.\n\nChoose title autogeneration method\n\nHere you can choose how your titles on index pages are generated. You can change which order your blog name and index title are displayed, or you can remove the blog name from the title completely.\n\nDefine a character to separate BlogName and Post title\n\nHere you can change which character separates your blog title and index page name when using autogenerated post titles. Common values are | or –\n\nEnable custom titles\n\nBy default the theme creates post titles based on the title of your post and your blog name. If you would like to make your meta title different than your actual post title you can define a custom title for each post using custom fields. This option must be enabled for custom titles to work, and you must choose a custom field name for your title below.\n\nEnable custom description\n\nIf you would like to add a meta description to your post you can do so using custom fields. This option must be enabled for descriptions to be displayed on post pages. You can add your meta description using custom fields based off the custom field name you define below.\n\nEnable custom keywords\n\nIf you would like to add meta keywords to your post you can do so using custom fields. This option must be enabled for keywords to be displayed on post pages. You can add your meta keywords using custom fields based off the custom field name you define below.\n\nEnable canonical URL’s\n\nCanonicalization helps to prevent the indexing of duplicate content by search engines, and as a result, may help avoid duplicate content penalties and pagerank degradation. Some pages may have different URL’s all leading to the same place. For example domain.com, domain.com/index.html, and www.domain.com are all different URLs leading to your homepage.

Defining a canonical URL tells the search engine which URL you would like to use officially. The theme bases its canonical URLs off your permalinks and the domain name defined in the settings tab of wp-admin.\n\nCustom field Name to be used for title\n\nWhen you define your title using custom fields you should use this value for the custom field Name. The Value of your custom field should be the custom title you would like to use.\n\nCustom field Name to be used for description\n\nWhen you define your meta description using custom fields you should use this value for the custom field Name. The Value of your custom field should be the custom description you would like to use.\n\nCustom field Name to be used for keywords\n\nWhen you define your keywords using custom fields you should use this value for the custom field Name. The Value of your custom field should be the meta keywords you would like to use, separated by commas.\n\nIf custom titles are disabled, choose auto-generation method\n\nIf you are not using custom post titles you can still have control over how your titles are generated. Here you can choose which order you would like your post title and blog name to be displayed, or you can remove the blog name from the title completely.\n\nDefine a character to separate BlogName and Post title\n\nHere you can change which character separates your blog title and post name when using autogenerated post titles. Common values are | or –\n\nSEO > Index Page SEO\n\nEnable custom title\n\nBy default the theme uses a combination of your blog name and your blog description, as defined when you created your blog, to create your homepage titles. However if you want to create a custom title then simply enable this option and fill in the custom title field below.\n\nEnable meta description\n\nBy default the theme uses your blog description, as defined when you created your blog, to fill in the meta description field. If you would like to use a different description then enable this option and fill in the custom description field below.\n\nEnable meta keywords\n\nBy default the theme does not add keywords to your header. Most search engines don’t use keywords to rank your site anymore, but some people define them anyway just in case. If you want to add meta keywords to your header then enable this option and fill in the custom keywords field below.\n\nEnable canonical URL’s\n\nCanonicalization helps to prevent the indexing of duplicate content by search engines, and as a result, may help avoid duplicate content penalties and pagerank degradation. Some pages may have different URLs all leading to the same place. For example domain.com, domain.com/index.html, and www.domain.com are all different URLs leading to your homepage.

The theme bases its canonical URLs off your permalinks and the domain name defined in the settings tab of wp-admin.\n\nHomepage custom title (if enabled)\n\nIf you have enabled custom titles you can add your custom title here. Whatever you type here will be placed between the < title >< /title > tags in header.php\n\nHomepage meta description (if enabled)\n\nIf you have enabled meta descriptions you can add your custom description here.\n\nHomepage meta keywords (if enabled)\n\nIf you have enabled meta keywords you can add your custom keywords here. Keywords should be separated by commas. For example: wordpress,themes,templates,elegant\n\nIf custom titles are disabled, choose autogeneration method\n\nIf you are not using custom post titles you can still have control over how your titles are generated. Here you can choose which order you would like your post title and blog name to be displayed, or you can remove the blog name from the title completely.\n\nDefine a character to separate BlogName and Post title\n\nHere you can change which character separates your blog title and post name when using autogenerated post titles. Common values are | or –\n\nIntegration\n\nThe integrate tab is great for adding third party code to certain areas of the theme. Code can be added to your websites head and body, as well as before and after each post. For example, if you need to add a tracking code to your website (such as google analytics), but are unsure which PHP file to edit in order to add the code to the < body > of your website, you can simply input this code into the “body” field of the Integration tab.\n\nFor more information on getting the most out of the Integration Tab, see our blog post on\nWays To Use The Integration Tab In Our ePanel Theme Options\n\nhttps://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/four-creative-ways-to-use-the-integration-tab-in-our-epanel-theme-options\n\nEnable header code\n\nDisabling this option will remove the header code below from your blog.

This is useful if you need to input a tracking pixel for a state counter such as Google Analytics.\n\nAdd code to the top of your posts\n\nAny code you place here will be placed at the top of all single posts. This is useful if you are looking to integrating things such as social bookmarking links.\n\nAdd code to the bottom of your posts, before the comments\n\nAny code you place here will be placed at the top of all single posts.

    "html": "Extra Theme Documentation\nENTER SEARCH TERM\nDIVI\nEXTRA\nBLOOM\nMONARCH\nDIVI BUILDER\nDEVELOPERS\nBACK TO EXTRA THEME DOCUMENTATION\nAn Overview Of Post Formats In Extra\n\nExtra supports all major post formats, giving your blog a wonderful variation of media.\n\nExtra Supports All The Major Post Formats\n\nWhen you write a blog post, you can apply one of 7 different post formats to the post: Standard, Video, Audio, Quote, Gallery, Link, and Map. Each of these formats structures your post differently, putting more focus on the type of content that the format represents.\n\nWhen you write a blog post, you will notice a box to the right of your text editor labeled “Format.” Within this box are the 6 format options. Choosing “Standard” will result in a normally-formatted blog post, while each of the other options has a unique design associated with their format type.\n\nUsing The Video Post Format\n\nFor posts using the Video Post Format, a video is placed at the top of the post. Additionally, the post’s Featured Image will be replaced with an embedded video in post listings.\n\nUpon selecting the “Video” post format from within the Format options box, you will notice a new settings box has been added in the left column. There you can define your video(s) by either copy/pasting a video URL (from providers like Youtube and Vimeo) or by installing your own HTML5 video via the WordPress Media Library.\n\nUsing The Audio Post Format\n\nPosts using the Audio Post Format will display an audio player at the top of their content. The post’s Featured Image on index pages will be replaced by an audio player as well. Upon selecting the “Audio” post format from within the Format options box, you will notice a new settings box has been added in the left column. You can use the options provided there to define an Audio file for the post.\n\nUsing The Quote Post Format\n\nApplying the Quote Post Format to a post will display a stylized quote at the top of your post. The stylized quote will also replace the post’s Featured Image on all index pages.\n\nUpon selecting the Quote Post Format from within the Format options box, you will notice a new settings box has been added in the left column. You can use the options provided there to define a quote for the post.\n\nUsing The Gallery Post Format\n\nAn image gallery is displayed at the top of the post content when you apply the Gallery Post Format to a post. A gallery slider will replace the post’s Featured Image on all index pages.\nUpon selecting the Gallery Post Format from within the Format options box, you will notice a new settings box has been added in the left column. You can use the options provided there to define your gallery images for the post.\n\nUsing The Link Post Format\n\nApplying the Link Post Format to a post will display a stylized link at the top of your post. The stylized link will also replace the post’s Featured Image on all index pages.\n\nUpon selecting the Link Post Format from within the Format options box, you will notice a new settings box has been added in the left column. You can use the options provided there to define a link for the post.\n\nUsing The Map Post Format\n\nWhen you apply the Map Post Format to a post, a map centered on a location of your choosing will appear prominently at the top of the post content. This can be useful in various situations, especially for sites where posts might be connected to a physical location (a restaurant review site is one example that comes to mind).\n\nUpon selecting the Map Post Format from within the Format options box, you will notice a new settings box has been added in the left column. You can use the options provided there to define a map point for the post as well as configure the map’s zoom level and positioning.\n\nGoogle Maps API Key\n\nAn API key is required in order to use the Contat Page Template since it contains a google Map. To obtain an API key, log into the Google Developers Console, which will guide you through the process, and activate the Google Maps JavaScript API and any related services automatically. The first thing you will be asked to do is create a new project.\n\nNext you will be asked to name your project. You can name the project anything you like. In this example, I simply called it “Maps.” You can also input your website’s domain name (add an * in front of it if you allow access from both www.domain.com and domain.com) to make sure to other website’s are allowed to your your API key.\n\nAfter you have created an named your project, you will be presented with an API Key that you can use.\n\nAfter you have obtained an API key, you must copy/paste it into the theme options panel by navigating to: Divi>>Theme Options>>General Settings>>Google Maps API Key"

Next, find the Header & Navigation panel. Now, click the panel to reveal the relevant settings and then adjust them to your liking.\n\nHeader Format\n\nHere you can adjust your header’s general format, such as switching between the Default and Centered layouts. Choosing Centered will place your logo above your navigation menu and it will be centered horizontally within the header. You can also choose to hide your header navigation area until the page is scrolled.\n\nPrimary Menu Bar\n\nIn this section you can adjust the size, style, and color of your primary navigation menu. This is the larger area at the top of the page which contains your logo and your primary menu links. From within this panel you can adjust the height of your logo, change the background color of the menu bar, change the color of your menu links, and more.\n\nSecondary Menu Bar\n\nThe secondary menu bar is the smaller of the two navigation areas.

In this customizer panel you can customize the style of the secondary navigation bar including its background color, menu link color, and font style.\n\nFixed Navigation\n\nThe fixed navigation bar refers to the state of the navigation bar after scrolling. You will notice that as you scroll the page, your menu bar shrinks and remains fixed to the top of the screen to provide more space on the screen for your content. You can adjust the height of the menu if you think it shrinks too small, and/or you can adjust the colors of the menu and menu links independently from the menu’s non-fixed state.\n\nHeader Elements\n\nHeader elements are optional elements that you can display in your navigation bar, each of which can be enabled/disabled in this panel. Currently, the available elements include social follow icons, search icon, WooCommerce Cart, & Trending widget (which displays the titles of your most-popular posts like a news ticker)."

One of the ways it can be used is to create an online digital portfolio. In Extra, a Portfolio is basically a group of Project posts, represented by their featured images and post meta information, that link back to the individual projects’ page.\nThere are five Portfolio layouts/styles included with Extra, including: Standard, Standard Grid, Fullwidth Grid, Masonry Grid and Fullwidth Carousel.\n\nHow To Create A New Project\n\nExtra makes building a project fun and easy. When you installed Extra, a ‘Projects’ menu item was added to the main menu of your WordPress Dashboard so you can create Projects in the same manner as a Post or Page. You also have the option to use the basic project layout, or to use the Divi Builder to create truly amazing project layouts.\n\nCreating Your Project\n\nTitle\n\nStart off by defining your project title.\n\nContent Editor\n\nWhen using the basic project layout (instead of the Divi Builder), your featured image will appear at the top of the page above any content that you place in the content editor.\n\nCategories\n\nProject categories are separate from post categories so that you can have full control over what appears inside of your portfolios. Here you can add a new category or choose from existing categories.\n\nSkills\n\nSkills are to Project Posts as Tags are to Regular Posts. They provide another method of organizing your projects as well as an easy way for your site’s visitors to navigate and discover your portfolio content.\n\nExtra Settings\n\nHere you can configure various post options for your project such as which of your Sidebars should be displayed, the Sidebar display location, post meta visibility, etc.\n\nProject Details Options Group\n\nThe options inside this settings box allow you to configure what is displayed in the Project Details area on the frontend.\n\nProject Details Title\n\nHere you can configure the title for the Project Details area. The default title is “Project Details”.\n\nProject URL\n\nWhen using the basic project layout (instead of the Divi Builder), your featured image will appear at the top of the page above any content that you place in the content editor.\n\nOpen In New Window\n\nChoose whether or not the project URL should open in a new window.\n\nProject URL Text\n\nThe text that will be used to create a link to your project URL.\n\nProject Description Location\n\nHere yo can choose where on the page the Project Details area will be displayed (eg. below content, in the sidebar, etc).\n\nProject Short Description\n\nA short description for your project to be included in the Project Details area.\n\nFeatured Image\n\nHere you can select a featured image for your project by choosing/installing an image via the WordPress Media Library. This will be the image that will be used to create the thumbnail that represents your project in portfolios.\n\nA thumbnail is a copy of an image that has been scaled and/or cropped to fit a predefined size. For best results when using a grid layout, we recommend that all of your project featured images have the same aspect ratio.\n\nProject Gallery\n\nThe options inside this settings box allow you to configure an Image Gallery Slider for your project.\n\nAdd Images\n\nThis option allows you to use the WordPress Media Library to add existing photos to your project gallery and/or upload new photos.\n\nExtended Layout\n\nAs an alternative to the basic project layout, you can use the Divi Builder to create extended layouts. In this mode, you have just as much creative freedom as you do when creating any other post/page with the Divi Builder.\n\nNOTE: If you choose to use the builder, you will start from a blank canvas. That means all of the elements from the basic project layout (as described above) are removed (i.e. Title, Categories, Featured Image, Skills, and Date). However, you can still add this information to your project layout using the appropriate builder modules."

When you create a new post, you will notice a box labeled “Extra Settings”. To disable ratings for the post, simply select the option labeled “Hide Post Rating”.\n\nA post’s overall star rating is displayed with it’s meta information (eg.

We recommend WooCommerce because it provides the best overall balance between feature set, code quality, cost, and support. While you can certainly use other eCommerce plugins, we cannot guarantee full functionality nor can we provide support for issues related to the use of other eCommerce plugins.\n\nWooCommerce Basics\n\nAfter you enable the plugin, you will see two new top-level menu items in your WordPress Dashboard: “WooCommerce” and “Products”. You can use those menus to adjust your site’s eCommerce settings and to create new products. You can find full documentation on WooCommerce here.\n\nPlease note that while the Divi Builder includes various WooCommerce modules, you can also use WooCommerce by itself, without the builder. You can use the standard pages that are created by WooCommerce (Checkout, Shopping Cart, etc) as outlined in their documentation. You can also link directly to your WooCommerce product categories, and/or use the WooCommerce Shortcodes within a Divi Builder Code Module. This gives you the freedom to do just about anything."

Want to adjust the size or spacing of text or an element of your website at the click of a button? The Customizer is where you want to start! To customizer panels can be accessed via the\n\nExtra > Theme Customizer and Extra > Module Customizer links in your WordPress Dashboard. The Theme Customizer gives you control over site-wide theme elements, such as your menu & logo size or your body and header text styles. The Module Customizer gives you size & font controls over individual modules. Do you want to reduce the height of all the slider modules on your website? That can be done in just a few seconds via the Module Customizer! Let’s take a closer look.\n\nExploring The Theme Customizer\n\nFirst we will explore the Theme Customizer. There are hundreds of options here, separated into different categories. When you first open up the customizer you will see several panels, such as “Header & Navigation” and “General Settings.” Opening these panels will reveal the options related to those areas of your website. As you adjust the settings within the customizer, you will be given a live preview of their effects. Once you save your changes, the new styles will be reflected on your live website.\n\nYou can do just about anything with the Theme Customizer without ever touching a line of code. For a more detailed look at some of the different customizer options, and some creative ways to use these options together, be sure to watch the instructional video above.\n\nExploring The Module Customizer\n\nThe Module Customizer works just like the Theme Customizer, except it focuses on the customization of individual modules as opposed to general website elements. When you open up the Module Customizer, you will see a separate panel for each of the Divi Builder modules. Opening up these panels will reveal customizer controls that can be used to adjust the spacing and typography of each module across your entire website.\n\nFor example, if you think that the FullWidth Slider Module’s default settings have too much padding, you can simply open the Fullwidth Slider panel and adjust the padding slider. Now whenever you add a new Fullwidth Slider to a page, the customized padding value will be reflected. There’s no need to use a Child Theme or adjust the Advanced Module settings for the individual module. The Module Customizer is a collection of global module controls."

This is the area, usually below the post title, which displays basic information about your post. The highlighted items shown below will appear.\n\nShow Comments on posts\n\nYou can disable this option if you want to remove the comments and comment form from single post pages.\n\nSharing Icons\n\nYou can choose which social networks’ icons are shown on your posts (for social sharing).\n\nSingle Page Layout\nShow Comments on Pages\n\nBy default comments are not placed on pages, however, if you would like to allow people to comment on your pages simply enable this option.\n\nGeneral Settings\nPost Info Section\n\nHere you can choose which items appear in the post meta info section on pages.

Currently, Elegant Themes support Yoast SEO and All-In-One SEO.\n\nEnable canonical URL’s\n\nCanonicalization helps to prevent the indexing of duplicate content by search engines, and as a result, may help avoid duplicate content penalties and pagerank degradation. Some pages may have different URL’s all leading to the same place. For example domain.com, domain.com/index.html, and www.domain.com are all different URLs leading to your homepage. From a search engine’s perspective these duplicate URLs, which also occur often due to custom permalinks, may be treaded individually instead of as a single destination. Defining a canonical URL tells the search engine which URL you would like to use officially. The theme bases its canonical URLs off your permalinks and the domain name defined in the settings tab of wp-admin.\n\nEnable meta descriptions\n\nCheck this box if you want to display meta descriptions on category/archive pages. The description is based off the category description you choose when creating/edit your category in wp-admin.\n\nChoose title autogeneration method\n\nHere you can choose how your titles on index pages are generated. You can change which order your blog name and index title are displayed, or you can remove the blog name from the title completely.\n\nDefine a character to separate BlogName and Post title\n\nHere you can change which character separates your blog title and index page name when using autogenerated post titles. Common values are | or –\n\nEnable custom titles\n\nBy default the theme creates post titles based on the title of your post and your blog name. If you would like to make your meta title different than your actual post title you can define a custom title for each post using custom fields. This option must be enabled for custom titles to work, and you must choose a custom field name for your title below.\n\nEnable custom description\n\nIf you would like to add a meta description to your post you can do so using custom fields. This option must be enabled for descriptions to be displayed on post pages. You can add your meta description using custom fields based off the custom field name you define below.\n\nEnable custom keywords\n\nIf you would like to add meta keywords to your post you can do so using custom fields. This option must be enabled for keywords to be displayed on post pages. You can add your meta keywords using custom fields based off the custom field name you define below.\n\nEnable canonical URL’s\n\nCanonicalization helps to prevent the indexing of duplicate content by search engines, and as a result, may help avoid duplicate content penalties and pagerank degradation. Some pages may have different URL’s all leading to the same place. For example domain.com, domain.com/index.html, and www.domain.com are all different URLs leading to your homepage. From a search engine’s perspective these duplicate URLs, which also occur often due to custom permalinks, may be treated individually instead of as a single destination. Defining a canonical URL tells the search engine which URL you would like to use officially. The theme bases its canonical URLs off your permalinks and the domain name defined in the settings tab of wp-admin.\n\nCustom field Name to be used for title\n\nWhen you define your title using custom fields you should use this value for the custom field Name. The Value of your custom field should be the custom title you would like to use.\n\nCustom field Name to be used for description\n\nWhen you define your meta description using custom fields you should use this value for the custom field Name. The Value of your custom field should be the custom description you would like to use.\n\nCustom field Name to be used for keywords\n\nWhen you define your keywords using custom fields you should use this value for the custom field Name. The Value of your custom field should be the meta keywords you would like to use, separated by commas.\n\nIf custom titles are disabled, choose auto-generation method\n\nIf you are not using custom post titles you can still have control over how your titles are generated. Here you can choose which order you would like your post title and blog name to be displayed, or you can remove the blog name from the title completely.\n\nDefine a character to separate BlogName and Post title\n\nHere you can change which character separates your blog title and post name when using autogenerated post titles. Common values are | or –\n\nSEO > Index Page SEO\n\nEnable custom title\n\nBy default the theme uses a combination of your blog name and your blog description, as defined when you created your blog, to create your homepage titles. However if you want to create a custom title then simply enable this option and fill in the custom title field below.\n\nEnable meta description\n\nBy default the theme uses your blog description, as defined when you created your blog, to fill in the meta description field. If you would like to use a different description then enable this option and fill in the custom description field below.\n\nEnable meta keywords\n\nBy default the theme does not add keywords to your header. Most search engines don’t use keywords to rank your site anymore, but some people define them anyway just in case. If you want to add meta keywords to your header then enable this option and fill in the custom keywords field below.\n\nEnable canonical URL’s\n\nCanonicalization helps to prevent the indexing of duplicate content by search engines, and as a result, may help avoid duplicate content penalties and pagerank degradation. Some pages may have different URLs all leading to the same place. For example domain.com, domain.com/index.html, and www.domain.com are all different URLs leading to your homepage.

Defining a canonical URL tells the search engine which URL you would like to use officially. The theme bases its canonical URLs off your permalinks and the domain name defined in the settings tab of wp-admin.\n\nHomepage custom title (if enabled)\n\nIf you have enabled custom titles you can add your custom title here. Whatever you type here will be placed between the < title >< /title > tags in header.php\n\nHomepage meta description (if enabled)\n\nIf you have enabled meta descriptions you can add your custom description here.\n\nHomepage meta keywords (if enabled)\n\nIf you have enabled meta keywords you can add your custom keywords here. Keywords should be separated by commas. For example: wordpress,themes,templates,elegant\n\nIf custom titles are disabled, choose autogeneration method\n\nIf you are not using custom post titles you can still have control over how your titles are generated. Here you can choose which order you would like your post title and blog name to be displayed, or you can remove the blog name from the title completely.\n\nDefine a character to separate BlogName and Post title\n\nHere you can change which character separates your blog title and post name when using autogenerated post titles. Common values are | or –\n\nIntegration\n\nThe integrate tab is great for adding third party code to certain areas of the theme. Code can be added to your websites head and body, as well as before and after each post. For example, if you need to add a tracking code to your website (such as google analytics), but are unsure which PHP file to edit in order to add the code to the < body > of your website, you can simply input this code into the “body” field of the Integration tab.\n\nFor more information on getting the most out of the Integration Tab, see our blog post on\nWays To Use The Integration Tab In Our ePanel Theme Options\n\nhttps://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/four-creative-ways-to-use-the-integration-tab-in-our-epanel-theme-options\n\nEnable header code\n\nDisabling this option will remove the header code below from your blog.

This is useful if you are looking to integrating things such as social bookmarking links.\n\nAdd code to the bottom of your posts, before the comments\n\nAny code you place here will be placed at the top of all single posts.

    "html": "Extra Theme Documentation\nENTER SEARCH TERM\nDIVI\nEXTRA\nBLOOM\nMONARCH\nDIVI BUILDER\nDEVELOPERS\nBACK TO EXTRA THEME DOCUMENTATION\nAn Introduction To The Extra Theme\n\nLearn the basics of the theme in this complete video overview. Newcomers, start here!\n\nWhat Is Extra?\n\nThe first thing you need to know about Extra is that it’s built on a rock-solid foundation, our Divi Builder. The Divi Builder allows you to create beautiful and unique post and page layouts visually, without touching a single line of code. It gives anyone the ability to create truly dynamic websites with ease.\n\nIn many ways, Extra was conceived as the counterpart to the Divi Theme. Extra does the things that Divi was never meant to do. Beautiful, versatile, magazine-like layouts that cater to a variety of blogs and online publications are Extra’s forte. Robust customization options that allow for unique and elegant post feeds with a focus on social interaction and user engagement are Extra’s second nature. The bottom line is this: Where Divi’s primary focus is on the page, Extra’s focus is on the post feed.\n\nExtra’s Category Builder The Divi Builder: Extended\n\nExtra extends upon its Divi Builder foundation with a brand new set of post-based modules. These modules bring the builder’s advanced drag-and-drop functionality to your home and category pages. Collectively, we call these new modules the Category Builder. Extra’s Category Builder gives you control over your home and category pages like never before, allowing you to completely build them from the ground up. This lets you break away from the standard, prebuilt category pages, so you can create unique experiences on a per-category-basis.\n\nCategory Builder Modules\n\nExtra comes with a new set of Divi Builder modules built specifically for the needs of bloggers and online publications. These new modules can be used to build a variety of different homepage and category layouts. Now you can build a post feed to meet the needs of your unique content.\n\nThere are currently two main types of category modules with which you can display posts:\n\nWidget Style\n\nPosts\n\nPosts Carousel\n\nPosts Slider\n\nTabbed Posts\n\nFeed Style\n\nBlog Feed\n\nBlog Feed (Masonry)\n\nThrough the combination of different column structures and modules, a wide range of category and homepage designs can be created. Whether you are running a personal blog or a huge online media website, Extra can be tailored to suite your needs.\n\nCreating A Category Layout\n\nCreating a Category Layout is done much in the same way as you would create a new page or post. You will start by navigating to Extra >> Category Builder in your WordPress Dashboard. You will then be presented with a list of your existing Category Layouts. To create a new layout, click the Add New button that appears at the top of the page, next to the title. Next, use the Divi Builder interface to create your layout. Hint: Start out by clicking “Insert Columns”.\n\nConfiguring A Category Layout\n\nIn the left column you will notice a box labeled Categories as well as a box labeled Layout Usage and a box labeled Extra Settings. They allow you to configure when and where your layout will be used on the frontend of your website and if/how the sidebar should be shown.\n\nProducts & Projects\n\nIn addition to standard blog posts, Extra includes full support for two other important areas: Projects and Products. If you are a designer looking to showcase your recent work, Extra makes it dead simple. Looking to sell products to your readers? Extra makes that easy as well with built-in WooCommerce integration.\n\nPost & Product Reviews\n\nGive your review posts some extra polish using Extra’s custom review system. It includes a built-in User Rating System allowing your site’s users to rate posts as well. This fosters user engagement and provides valuable insight."
