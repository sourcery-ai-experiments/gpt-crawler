    "html": "NEWS\n4 May 2018\nMGA publishes Industry Guidelines on the GDPR in consultation with the IDPC\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) has published a guidance document on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which comes into force on 25 May 2018. This regulation is aimed at harmonizing data protection regulation across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens’ data privacy and to reshape the way organisations across the region approach data privacy. The GDPR builds on the foundations of the current data protection legislation demanding more from organisations in terms of accountability for the use and retention of personal data and enhances individuals’ rights to data privacy.\n\nThe MGA recognises the industry’s concerns about GDPR-compliance and the way it will impact the gaming industry, so it has undertaken the task of producing this guidance document after a consultation process with the Office of the Information and Data Protection Commissioner (IDPC), which is the responsible supervisory authority for regulating the application of data protection legislation. It will remain the responsibility of MGA licensees to ensure they are compliant with the GDPR and with the gaming regulatory framework.\n\nThese guidelines are considered to be a living document and will be further developed over time as practical issues arise with the effective implementation of the GDPR. They are to be read in parallel with legal requirements imposed on Operators by virtue of Maltese gaming laws, and are without prejudice to the said legislation. Furthermore, such guidelines and the interpretations contained therein are without prejudice to any decision which the Commissioner may take in relation to complaints and, or to any other specific data protection issue. These interpretations are also without prejudice to any further guidelines or opinions that might be issued by the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party and, as from 25 May 2018, by the European Data Protection Board.\n\nThe Guidelines on GDPR Compliance can be accessed here."

    "url": "https://www.mga.org.mt/new-gaming-act-approved-by-maltese-parliament/",
    "html": "NEWS\n9 May 2018\nNew Gaming Act Approved by Maltese Parliament\n\nYesterday, Maltese Parliament approved the third and final reading of the new Gaming Act, which shall elevate the jurisdictional profile of Malta from a regulatory perspective by strengthening the MGA’s supervisory role, specifically the compliance and enforcement functions to better achieve the regulatory objectives, in line with concurrent developments relating to anti-money laundering and combating the funding of terrorism.\n\nThis new framework shall also broaden the regulatory scope to increase the MGA’s oversight and to allow, in a proportionate manner, intervention where necessary. As stated previously, the new Act will also segment the role of a Key Official within a licensed entity into various key functions for direct scrutiny and targeted supervision controls, and shall strengthen the player protection framework by formalising the role of the MGA’s Player Support Unit as a mediator between aggrieved players and operators. The new Act also envisages new and more effective processes for criminal and administrative justice.\n\nOther important areas of focus include consumer protection standards, responsible gaming measures, reporting of suspicious sports betting transactions in the fight against the manipulation of sports competitions and objective-orientated standards to encourage innovation and development.\n\nThe legislation is currently undergoing the Technical Regulation Information System process (TRIS) in line with European Union Directive 2015/1535, whereby the EU Commission and Member States may issue their opinions thereon. In the absence of issues emerging from this process, it shall come into force on 1 July 2018 for remote gaming operators and, following a transitory period, on 1 January 2019 for land-based operators. The same considerations apply to the subsidiary legislation and Directives which are envisaged to be issued under the remit of the new Act, which are also currently undergoing the TRIS process. In order to facilitate the transition to the new legislative framework, the MGA has embarked on a process of liaison with existing licensees, and outreach shall be increased in due course both with operators as well as with other interested stakeholders. This shall include guidelines on the application and interpretation of the new laws and policy.\n\nThe Parliamentary Secretary for Financial Services, Digital Economy & Innovation, Hon. Silvio Schembri said; “I would like to thank the MGA for moving the regulatory agenda for gaming services forward, as well as for identifying areas for further and continuous improvement. The MGA will periodically review the regulatory performance of the sector and the framework itself and will advise Government on the attainment of its objectives mainly focusing on consumer protection and integrity.“\n\nThe MGA’s Chief Executive Officer, Heathcliff Farrugia stated; “This is a very important milestone for the MGA. The new law establishes very robust compliance and enforcement powers and structures, and lays the necessary foundation to continue to strengthen player protection.”"

    "url": "https://www.mga.org.mt/the-mga-reacts-to-media-articles/",
    "html": "NEWS\n11 May 2018\nThe MGA reacts to Media Articles\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority would like to draw attention to media articles published by the Investigative Reporting Project Italy (IRPI), La Repubblica and the Times of Malta. The MGA objects to the articles in question which contain factual inaccuracies, speculation, untruths and a misleading portrayal of the Malta Gaming Authority and the way it operates. The latest published articles refer to rehashed stories on which enforcement action has already been taken accordingly by the MGA.\n\nThe MGA takes exception to the claim that “Gaming Companies threatened to leave Malta if it failed to clean up the sector”. These claims are completely false and solely intended to tarnish the reputation of the Maltese Jurisdiction.\n\nIn addition, the Malta Gaming Authority also denies lack of cooperation with Italian Authorities. The MGA does not normally receive cooperation requests from Italian authorities other than its counterpart gambling regulator in Italy. Requests from law enforcement or financial intelligence units are sent to the corresponding authorities in Malta. Naturally, the MGA cooperates and provides any relevant information to the competent authorities when duly requested, or if the MGA deems that such information in its possession needs to be shared with the respective authorities.\n\nThe prevention of criminal infiltration is of the utmost importance for the MGA. The MGA ensures that its procedures and resources in the field of due diligence are the best possible, and in fact, many applicants are refused a licence on the basis of failure to meet fitness and propriety standards. Others are detected as part of on-going checks, and the appropriate action is taken immediately. With that said, if detection and prosecution of organised crime was easy, it would not exist in the first place.\n\nIn certain cases, information and resources (such as in-depth intelligence into the activities of organised crime, or resources such as phone tapping) available to Italian law enforcement and anti-organised crime police is not necessarily readily available to gambling regulators, whether Maltese or otherwise. The MGA takes lessons learnt on board, and sees its role also fulfilled when another regulator or law enforcement agency provides actionable information. This allows the MGA to take all necessary action to detect and prevent such criminal infiltration from continuing, and to assist with the eventual collection of evidence and prosecution.\n\nThe MGA’s official position on these reports was already illustrated to the Investigative Reporting Project Italy (IRPI), who in turn decided not to publish the MGA’s replies for reasons which are not ‘completely clear’."

The MGA’s strategy is to be at the forefront of remote gaming regulation while embracing innovation and acknowledging that a prudent approach in this area is both sensible and required.\n\nThe characteristics of virtual currencies, while often cited as drivers for their adoption, simultaneously pose a number of risks which need to be addressed in a well thought out manner.

The termination of his employment was effected following lengthy disciplinary proceedings, presided by external and independent adjudicators, in the course of which various witnesses, independent of the Authority, testified about Mr. Atanasov’s shortcomings. The termination of his employment occurred with effect from 26 February 2015.\n\nMr Atanasov started making allegations of wrongdoing against the Authority at the end of the disciplinary proceedings. These were duly investigated by the Authority’s Internal Auditor and no irregularities were discovered. The chronology is undisputable: The Authority did not take any retaliatory action against Mr Atanasov for any alleged whistleblower action. Mr Atanasov made allegations about the Authority after he was subjected to disciplinary proceedings. When Mr Atanasov started making serious and false allegations about the Authority (in May 2017), following his termination of employment, the Authority filed judicial proceedings in order to protect its reputation.\n\nIt was only on 22 November 2017, two years and eight months after his termination of employment, that Mr Atanasov filed an application in the First Hall of the Civil Court of Malta, claiming whistleblower protection. Such proceedings are sub iudice. The Authority, whilst contesting Mr Atanasov’s claims as factually and legally false and incorrect, declares that it respects Mr Atanasov’s request for whistleblower status and will abide by any final and definitive judicial declarations.\n\nThe Authority looks forward to the opportunity to provide all the information, explanations and evidence in the Law Courts, to clear this matter once and for all. The MGA is also willing to cooperate with GRECO and any other independent authority, to show evidence to prove that nothing irregular took place but that the Authority acted in accordance with the principles of natural justice, acting responsibly and transparently throughout the whole process."

    "html": "NEWS\n2 July 2018\nThe MGA Publishes its 2017 Annual Report and Financial Statements\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) has published its Annual Report and Financial Statements for the financial year ending 31 December 2017. The report provides an overview of the activities and work performed throughout the year by the MGA which mainly focused on the finalisation of the new Gaming Act, coming into force in 2018, and on the enhancement of its compliance systems, including the implementation of the requirements of the EU 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive.\n\nThroughout 2017, the MGA also focused on enhancing its IT systems, as reflected in the introduction of the Licensee Relationship Management System (LRMS), a secure and dedicated portal featuring a one-stop shop for licensing and reporting and a new communication channel.\n\nThe Annual Report also looks at 2018 and beyond, whereby the MGA will be focusing on the implementation of the new regulatory framework, the transition towards a risk-based approach to regulation, the continued implementation of onerous AML (Anti-Money Laundering)/CFT (Combating the Financing of Terrorism) obligations, and the application of the General Data Protection Regulation and its impact on operators and the MGA alike.\n\nThe following are the key highlights from the Annual Report:\n\nDuring the year under review, the MGA generated a total revenue of €66.3m in licence fees, gaming tax and other administrative fees and fines, compared to €62.5m in 2016. This represents an increase of €3.7m or a 6% year-on-year increase;\nThe direct contribution of the gaming industry to the Maltese economy was valued at €1.1 billion in 2017, with   approximately 9,800 full time jobs created within operators directly in the sector and other associated businesses;\nIn January of the same year, the MGA launched a licensing and regulatory regime based on the Skill Games Regulations for the online skill games sector, including the creation of specific B2C and B2B licences for ‘controlled skill games’;\nIt also conducted a thorough study to assess the application of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and the use of cryptocurrencies in a sandbox environment, with the objective of issuing a consultation paper and subsequently, guidelines, in 2018;\nAs highlighted above, the MGA kept investing in its IT systems, most notably on the introduction of a New Licensee Relationship Management System accessible through a secure and dedicated web portal. This system has changed the way the MGA interacts with its existent and prospective licensees through the digitisation of regulatory and licensing processes;\nIn 2017, the MGA further enhanced its AML/CFT supervisory mechanisms, including the implementation of the EU 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive. This involved cooperation with the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) to develop supervisory practices and procedures, sector-specific guidelines, and joint supervision;\nMGA’s most important achievement was the finalisation of the new Gaming Act which was tabled in Parliament earlier this year. The new law is set to overhaul completely the way the Authority regulates the sector, once it comes into force in 2018.\n\nIn publishing this report, Heathcliff Farrugia, Chief Executive Officer of the Malta Gaming Authority, stated that: “Last year was perhaps one of the most exciting years for the MGA. The ongoing efforts and relentless work of MGA officials on the various projects the Authority embarked upon was reaching its final stages, with the new regulatory framework and the 4AMLD being the most notable ones.\n\nTheir introduction in 2018, coupled with the investment in IT systems shall continue to elevate our regulatory standards, by strengthening our controls and empowering the Authority to adopt a risk based approach towards enforcement and supervision.”\n\nWhoever wishes to receive hard copies of the Annual Report may send an email to info.mga@mga.org.mt"

    "url": "https://www.mga.org.mt/new-gaming-bill-tabled-maltese-parliament/",
    "html": "NEWS\n13 March 2018\nNew Gaming Bill tabled in Maltese Parliament\n\nThe Parliamentary Secretary for Financial Services, Digital Economy & Innovation, Hon. Silvio Schembri announced that a motion has been presented in Parliament for the first reading of a new Gaming Bill which will seek to repeal all the existing legislation and replace it with a singular primary Act of Parliament, together with subsidiary legislation covering horizontally the main thrusts of gaming regulation as well as a series of technical directives and guidelines currently being consulted on by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) for eventual publication and rollout by the regulator once the Act comes into force.\n\n“This Bill marks a major step in streamlining and encompassing the governance of all gaming services offered in and from Malta and across all channels under the competence of the MGA. The Government wants to ensure that the gaming industry continues to be run responsibly, fairly and free from criminal activity, so that the Maltese jurisdiction provides a safe and well regulated environment where the industry can also develop and innovate”, Hon. Silvio Schembri said.\n\nThrough this Bill, Government is ensuring that the MGA has the necessary latitude, resources and powers to regulate effectively the gaming industry and protect consumers, as required, focusing on evidence based methodologies. The Parliamentary Secretary added; “we hope to remove any red tape by increasing efficiency and flexibility for the Regulator, whilst improving the robustness of the current framework and focusing regulation on outcomes”, whilst also adding that the Act elevates the excellent reputation of the Maltese jurisdiction in this sector. Honourable Schembri remarked that thanks to this New Gaming Bill,  the industry will grow by another 4%.\n\nThe press conference was also addressed by Joseph Cuschieri, Executive Chairman of the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), who stated: “This is an important milestone and we welcome this major step forward by the Maltese Government. This Bill contains draft proposals which aim to bridge the regulatory gap between various gaming verticals and channels, including new technologies serving as a platform to future proof gaming regulation, whilst ensuring that consumers enjoy a consistent level of protection.”\n\nThe proposed regulatory framework will strengthen the MGA’s compliance and enforcement functions to better achieve its regulatory objectives, in line with concurrent developments on anti-money laundering and funding of terrorism obligations. It also empowers the MGA to be more agile in its decision-making, decreasing unnecessary regulatory burdens whilst strengthening supervision and focusing the regulator’s efforts on the areas which present a higher risk profile.\n\nOther important areas of focus include consumer protection standards, responsible gaming measures, reporting of suspicious sports betting transactions in the fight against the manipulation of sports competitions and objective-orientated standards to encourage innovation and development. The motion presented in Parliament is a result of an extensive period of public consultation conducted by the MGA, with various industry stakeholders and the general public, as well as numerous technical studies, economic and financial impact assessments. The consultation was launched in July 2017 and was very well received by the industry resulting into feedback from 53 different parties based both locally and abroad.\n\nInformation on these new proposals can be accessed from the draft Bill in the link provided.\n\nKey highlights of the new Gaming Act include:\n\nReplacing the current multi-licence system with a system in which there will be two different types of licences – a Business-to-Consumer (B2C) licence and a Business-to-Business (B2B) licence – covering different types of activities across multiple distribution channels;\nMoving towards an objective-based rather than excessively prescriptive regulatory approach, to allow for innovation whilst ensuring that the regulatory objectives are attained;\nBroadening the regulatory scope to increase MGA oversight and allow for intervention where necessary and in a proportionate manner;\nWidening the MGA’s powers under the compliance and enforcement functions to better achieve the regulatory objectives, in line with concurrent developments on anti-money laundering and funding of terrorism obligations;\nSegmenting the Key Official role into various key functions within a licensed activity, requiring approval, for direct scrutiny and targeted supervisory controls, thereby raising the bar for persons of responsibility within a gaming operation;\nStrengthening the player protection framework by formalising the mediatory role of the MGA’s Player Support Unit, enshrining segregation of player funds at law and moving towards a unified self-exclusion database across both remote and land-based delivery channels;\nIntroducing new and more effective processes for criminal and administrative justice, including the allocation of appeals from decisions of the Authority to the Administrative Review Tribunal and the introduction of a distinction between administrative and criminal offences;\nIntroducing the concept of administration to protect an operation in distress and, if necessary, to assist the winding down of an operation, thereby protecting jobs and player funds;\nMoving towards automated reporting, facilitating adherence to regulatory obligations and strengthening the Authority’s oversight;\nBolstering the Authority’s role in the fight against manipulation of sports competitions by introducing new obligations on operators to monitor sports betting and report suspicious bets, in line with the efforts being made by the National Anti-Corruption Task Force in which the Authority also actively participates;\nExempting B2B licensees from gaming tax, thus increasing Malta’s competitiveness as a hub for B2B activities."

    "url": "https://www.mga.org.mt/mga-key-functions-notification/",
    "html": "NEWS\n24 July 2018\nMGA – Key Functions Notification\n\nOne of the salient changes which shall be brought about by the new Gaming Act, as of 1 August 2018, is that licensees are required to identify the persons responsible for the key functions as defined at law. Such persons are, in turn, required to undergo the MGA’s scrutiny in order for the Authority to assess their fitness and propriety. The persons who fulfil the necessary criteria shall then be issued with a key function certificate for the relevant function or functions.\n\n1) Licensees are invited to inform the Authority at the earliest of any key functions which shall be fulfilled by one or more persons that have already been assessed and approved by the MGA, either in their capacity as employees of the licensee or due to the fact that under the Remote Gaming Regulations (S.L. 438.04) they provide the services of Key Official to the licensee. This will allow the Authority to commence preparations for the relevant key function certificate to be issued in due course.\n\n2) Persons not already known to and approved by the MGA, who have been earmarked to provide key functions, shall be notified to the MGA between the 1 August 2018 and the 30 September 2018 and shall, during such timeframe, submit all the required documentation.\n\n3) Until such time as all key persons are notified to, and assessed by, the Authority, the responsibility for the vacant key functions shall vest temporarily in the Key Official appointed under the Remote Gaming Regulations.\n\nIn terms of article 9 of the Gaming Authorisations and Compliance Directive, the following conflicts in key functions have been identified by the Authority:\n\n1) Compliance-based roles are incompatible with roles centred around the growth of the business.  In particular, the Chief Executive role, responsibility for the licensee’s finances (except responsibility for the payment of tax and fees due in terms of law) and responsibility for marketing and advertising are incompatible with the following roles:\n\n(i) Compliance with the licensee’s obligations emanating from the MGA licence/s;\n(ii) Player support;\n(iii) Responsible gaming.\n\n2) Without prejudice to the above:\n\n(a) the person responsible for the prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism is also expected to refrain from taking on other responsibilities which may conflict with his functions in such role, or which otherwise conflicts with such function or prejudices the person’s effectiveness and independence in such role, including but not limited to the Data Protection Officer;\n\n(b) the Data Protection Officer role is incompatible with any other role that manages or otherwise controls personal data, or which otherwise conflicts with such function or prejudices the person’s effectiveness in such role, including but not limited to the Money Laundering Reporting Officer;\n\n(c) the person responsible for internal audit is normally expected not to hold any other function.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the above is meant as prima facie guidance and is without prejudice to requirements stemming from other applicable legislation regarding certain functions, including but not limited to requirements relating to the Money Laundering Reporting Officer and the Data Protection Officer. The operational structure of each licensee is different, and therefore it is the responsibility of each licensee to ensure that conflicting functions are not exercised by the same person.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, in light of the fact that this segregation of roles is necessarily burdensome from a resources perspective, start-up undertakings as defined in the Gaming Licence Fees Regulations, and recognised as such by the Authority in line with the Start-Up Undertakings Directive, may be allowed to have a single person conduct roles which may prima facie appear conflicting, during the first year of operation, if the Authority is satisfied that the integrity of the licensed operation will not be negatively affected.\n\nFurthermore, such undertaking shall not be required to have a person responsible for the key function of internal audit, during such first year of operation. This is without prejudice to requirements stemming from other applicable laws."

This is in line with concurrent developments relating to anti-money laundering and combating the funding of terrorism.\n\nThe new regulatory framework also empowers the Authority to be more agile in its decision-making, by removing unnecessary regulatory burdens not conducive to the regulatory objectives, whilst simultaneously strengthening supervision and focusing the regulator’s efforts on areas which present a higher risk profile.\n\nFurthermore, the reform enhances consumer protection standards and responsible gaming measures, while promoting a risk-based approach towards regulation. It provides the MGA with wider powers in the fields of compliance and enforcement and establishes objective-oriented standards to encourage innovation and development.\n\nUnderlining the importance of this milestone the MGA’s Chief Executive Officer Heathcliff Farrugia stated that:”Today marks one of the most important days in the history of the MGA. Years of hard work finally come to fruition. I would like to thank all those involved in making the new regulatory framework a reality, in particular my predecessor Mr Joseph Cuschieri for the foresight to initiate this project, Parliamentary Secretary Hon. Silvio Schembri and the Maltese Government at large for their ongoing support and commitment, and especially the MGA’s personnel for their relentless work in developing and implementing the new legal regime.\n\nThis is the beginning of a new chapter in Maltese gaming regulation. One which builds on the foundations of the previous laws, and which empowers the Authority to further strengthen the way it regulates the industry, and to continue being a thought leader for the years to come.”\n\nSubject to the transitory provisions envisaged therein, this framework is applicable for remote gaming operators as of today 1 August 2018, whereas land-based operators shall become subject to these new laws as of 1 January 2019."

In a second phase, the sandbox framework will be extended to applications for the use of ITAs within the key technical equipment of licensees, to coincide with developments launched by the Malta Digital Innovation Authority (MDIA).\n\nThe Delta Summit was created to serve as a platform which promotes blockchain technology and other related business opportunities. Internationally, and as reflected in the recent approval of the VFA Act by Maltese Parliament, Malta has been repeatedly confirmed as a leading jurisdiction when it comes to regulating blockchain and cryptocurrency technology. This summit provides an opportunity to solidify Malta’s position as a regulated virtual currency and ICO Centre and the perfect platform for the Authority to outline details of its Sandbox Framework to all interested parties.\n\nDuring the Summit, the MGA’s Chief Executive Officer, Heathcliff Farrugia, stated that: “The MGA’s strategic mission is to be at the forefront of gaming regulation whilst embracing innovation. This, coupled with the rapid rise in interest from gaming operators to incorporate VFAs and DLT into their operations, were the main drivers behind the proactive approach taken by the Authority to issue a Sandbox Framework for the use of these technologies within a controlled regulatory environment. This Framework is intended as a live document and will therefore be subject to feedback and potential updates during its duration, whilst also keeping in consideration any technological or regulatory developments which may occur. The MGA envisages that this framework will run until end of October 2019, although its extension, both partially or wholly, could be a possibility. The Delta Summit is definitely the ideal place to launch this sandbox.”\n\nThe MGA’s CEO is also participating on a panel entitled “Blockchain and the Future of the Gaming Industry”, which will discuss blockchain regulation from a gaming perspective and gamification trends across industries.\n\nThe first-ever edition of the Delta Summit features major blockchain companies, renowned stand exhibitors and acclaimed international speakers. Additionally, it provides participants with a one-stop shop opportunity to discuss directly with regulators and blockchain companies alike."

This year’s edition was held at the Intercontinental Arena Conference Centre in St. Julians and was addressed by Prime Minister Hon. Joseph Muscat and Opposition Leader Hon. Adrian Delia.\n\nThe conference sparked discussions around the importance of innovation, focusing on the paradigm shifts occurring across the various industry sectors, and their potential to drive investment and shape the next wave of Malta’s growth. The main findings of the EY’s Annual Malta Attractiveness Survey 2018 were also presented during this event.\n\nDuring this conference, the Malta Gaming Authority’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Heathcliff Farrugia, participated on a panel entitled: ‘iGaming: the next big bet’, whereby he spoke about the recent introduction of the new Gaming Act, the launch of the sandboxed guidelines for Cryptocurrencies and the use of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) in the iGaming Industry, and about the future of the iGaming industry in general.\n\nDuring his intervention, the MGA’s CEO also discussed issues related to loot boxes in video gaming, the rise of eSports and also on the importance of innovation for both regulators and operators.  He stated that: “Innovation is a must, and it distinguishes a country, a regulator or an operator, from being a leader or a follower”.\n\nThe EY’s 2018 Annual Attractiveness event brought together over 900 public and private sector leaders and international investors."

Conscious of the need to remain at the forefront of innovation and to keep up with new developments in these technologies within the gaming industry, the Authority is actively considering the possibility of allowing the application of cryptocurrencies and DLT by its licensees.\n\nThe MGA is mindful that there are risks which need to be addressed in order to ensure that the necessary safeguards are in place to:\n\nprotect consumers,\ncater for the prevention of crime and money laundering or funding of terrorism (with due regard to the 4th Anti Money Laundering Directive), and\nprotect the reputation of the Maltese jurisdiction.\n\nIn this respect, the MGA is currently in the process of establishing the sandboxed (test and learn) live environment for cryptocurrency usage within the remote gaming sector, whilst also drafting guiding principles for the application of DLT and its various adaptations within the industry. Cognizant of the fact that a certain degree of expertise lies within the industry, with a number of innovative projects and concepts already available on the market, the Authority is reaching out to interested parties willing to share information regarding their cryptocurrencies and/or DLT projects. This can be done by registering interest and providing details on these projects by sending us an email on innovation.mga@mga.org.mt by not later than Monday, 8 January, 2018.\n\nThe Authority will be evaluating all submissions with a view to enrich and render more practical the sandbox environment and DLT guiding principles it intends publishing in Q1 of 2018."

The MGA objects to the articles in question which contain factual inaccuracies, speculation, untruths and a misleading portrayal of the Malta Gaming Authority and the way it operates. Our reactions to the articles in question are as follows:\n\n1) Mafia planned to infiltrate Malta gaming companies – Italian police in Palermo raids published on 15 December 2017:\n\n“The Malta Gaming Authority takes exception to such a speculative and senseless article which one can only conclude that it is intended solely to harm Malta’s reputation as a gaming jurisdiction of excellence. If such alleged plans to relocate underground activities to Malta were true (as reported in the article), such pans would have likely failed from a “fit and properness” standpoint since our rigorous due diligence procedures, criminal probity checks, investigations and intelligence gathering activities when on-boarding new licensees but also our ongoing supervisory processes are of a high standard and would have immediately red flagged any such attempts”\n\n2) Hillman put on State payroll two weeks after election – Malta Gaming Authority denied he was given consultancy job published on 24 December 2017:\n\n“The article in question contains untruths and factual inaccuracies which are listed hereunder:\n\nMr Hillman was engaged by the MGA with effect from 3 July 2017. Contract was signed on 28 June after all the relevant approvals were received in line with public procurement procedures. The MGA was correct (on 21 June 2017) in stating that Mr Hillman was not doing consultancy work for the MGA when the Times of Malta correspondent asked the question,\nThe MGA received no instructions whatsoever from the OPM to engage Mr Hillman. Any suggestions to this effect are purely speculative and totally untrue. All MGA consultancy engagements including Mr Hillman’s are based on the Authority’s business requirements, ongoing projects and strategic objectives and selection is based on competences of the individual(s) or firms concerned,\nAs far as is publicly available, Mr Hillman was investigated by The Times of Malta through a board of inquiry set up for that purpose and no wrongdoing on his part was found so much so that the Times of Malta reached an amicable solution to the dispute.”"

    "html": "NEWS\n21 December 2017\nFIAU publishes Legal Notice 372 of 2017 – Prevention of Money Laundering and Funding of Terrorism Regulations\n\nThe Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (“FIAU”) would like to bring to the attention of subject persons and any other interested third party that on 20 December 2017 Legal Notice 372 of 2017 was published in the Government Gazette. This Legal Notice introduces the Prevention of Money Laundering and Funding of Terrorism Regulations, 2017 (“PMLFTR 2017”) which are to repeal and replace the Prevention of Money Laundering and Funding of Terrorism Regulations, 2008 currently in force, with effect from 1 January 2018. The PMLFTR 2017 form part of the various changes to laws intended to transpose Directive (EU) 2015/849 into Maltese law.  A copy of this Legal Notice is available on the Laws of Malta website – http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/ – as well as on the FIAU’s own website – http://www.fiumalta.org/.\n\nThe main development that these new regulations introduce is the greater emphasis on adopting a risk based approach to fulfilling anti-money laundering and combating the funding of terrorism (“AML/CFT”) obligations and in particular customer due diligence requirements. Under the current regime subject persons could already apply customer due diligence requirements on a risk-sensitive basis, i.e. vary the extent and timing of the said requirements on the basis of the money laundering and funding of terrorism (“ML/FT”) risks present in a given business relationship or occasional transaction. Chapter 4 of Part I of the current Implementing Procedures already explains and provides guidance on how this could be done.\n\nHowever, with the eventual coming into force of the PMLFTR 2017, the risk-based approach will no longer be an alternative available to subject persons but the main manner in which subject persons are expected to apply AML/CFT requirements. Thus, with the exception of specifically provided for situations, such as when transacting business with Politically Exposed Persons or entering into correspondent relationships, subject persons will be allowed greater discretion in determining how to meet their AML/CFT obligations and will have the necessary flexibility in terms of extent and timing to address effectively the ML/FT risks they are exposed to.\n\nThe FIAU is currently working on a revision of the Implementing Procedures Part I which are intended to be issued for consultation in early 2018. The FIAU is aware that with the coming into force of the PMLFTR 2017, situations will arise where the AML/CFT requirements as set out in the PMLFTR 2017 will contrast with how these same requirements are spelled out in the current Part I and Part II of the Implementing Procedures as these were based on the PMLFTR 2008, which transposedthe 3rd EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive, and were written with a more prescriptive and rules-based system in mind.\n\nThroughout this interim period and until the publication of the revised Implementing Procedures Part I, the FIAU will not insist on a strict application of the rules contained in the Implementing Procedures Part I and will consider their application on a risk-sensitive basis as being in line with the PMLFTR 2017. Moreover where conflicts arise between the provisions of the PMLFTR 2017 and the Implementing Procedures the PMLFTR 2017 shall prevail. Subject persons shall at all times operate in compliance with the AML/CFT requirements envisaged under the PMLFTR 2017."

Among the proposals that have been revised are those relating to identification, the threshold approach and source of wealth. The document also touches upon some aspects that were not considered in the initial Consultation Document such as the appointment of the Money Laundering Reporting Officer.\n\nWhile still consisting of a series of non-binding proposals, the FIAU and the MGA consider the current document as delineating a clearer picture of what will be expected from licensees to comply with the Prevention of Money Laundering and Funding of Terrorism Regulations, 2017 (“PMLFTR”). This document does not cover all AML/CFT obligations but only those which merit sector specific interpretation, and the omission of any reference in this document to other AML/CFT obligations is not to be considered as tantamount to the inapplicability of the same.\n\nThis document, together with feedback received from licensees and interested parties, will form the basis of sector specific guidance to be issued at a later stage once the revision of the Part I of the Implementing Procedures is completed. Licensees and other interested parties are invited to submit any feedback they may have in relation to this document on the following email address – legal@fiumalta.org – by 5 March 2018."

Silvio Schembri, the MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri and President of the MCAST Board, Dr Silvio De Bono.\n\nThis strategic initiative is the start of a journey which will lead to the development of talent in the gaming sector and the creation of more long term careers for both local and foreign students, through educational programmes which will enhance the sustainability and growth of the workforce in today’s digital economy.\n\nThe MGA will be supporting EGIM for the development of its educational programmes pertaining to the Gaming industry but will also be enabling the transfer of the industry’s knowledge to MCAST. The curricula will further the educational development in areas relevant to this sector in today’s digital economy. The MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri stated that: “This project has been in the pipeline for more than two years and I am delighted that we are launching EGIM in partnership with MCAST. I believe that this partnership will provide the right quality in educational programmes and will go a long way in addressing the skills gap and the supply of more talented individuals to join the growing remote gaming sector.”\n\nDr. Silvio De Bono, President of the MCAST Board remarked how: “The gaming sector contributes €1.2 billion to the Maltese economy – 12 per cent of GDP. It certainly has room to grow however we need to encourage the young people to begin looking at professions in the iGaming industries which are a reality of today’s digital age. This is us reacting to the industry’s demand.  Today’s setup of EGIM is the cornerstone of tomorrow’s workforce in this digital revolution. I encourage you to visit our website and discover what EGIM and MCAST can do for you.”\n\nHon. Silvio Schembri, Parliamentary Secretary for Financial services, Digital Economy and Innovation stated that: “The signing of the agreement is a clear sign of the Government’s commitment to address the issue of skills mismatch while continuing to strengthen the iGaming industry. The agreement is a sign of walking the talk. Students will now have the tools to pursue a sustainable career in the iGaming industry.” Hon. Schembri added that now he looks forward to see more Maltese students contributing to the thriving gaming industry.\n\nHon. Evarist Bartolo, Minister for Education and Employment said that: “Matching the skills to jobs is proving to be a major task and the biggest stumbling block. We need our people to be both qualified and skilled. Words alone are not enough and we have taken another step in addressing this issue by launching a new project that matches the skills to demands being created by the industry.”\n\nAbout EGIM\n\nThe European Gaming Institute of Malta (EGIM) is a joint venture between the MGA and MCAST which has the objective of developing training and educational programmes for the gaming industry.\n\nEGIM aims to offer the best possible mix of short-term courses, diplomas and masters programmes for potential candidates coming from non-related gaming industries to familiarise themselves with an area of choice within the gaming industry to achieve adequate knowledge and skills.\n\nEGIM’s objective is to understand the skill requirements of the industry (current and future) and most importantly, forecast and prepare for the upcoming skill sets needed to build and create educational courses based on future technology and product trends.\n\nFor more information please visit www.egim.com.mt"

SiGMA is an annual gathering of stakeholders, operators and regulators from the gaming industry in one event and provides an ideal networking environment for all its participants. This year, the event took place between 22 and 25 November 2017.\n\nMGA’s Executive Chairman Joseph Cuschieri kicked off the KPMG Regulatory eSummit by stating that: “The gaming industry is entering a new era which will be dominated by the next generation legislation (to be enacted in Q1 of 2018), innovation and disruptive technologies in the context of a more challenging regulatory environment particularly in Europe. This places more responsibility on the MGA to be more proactive and agile in dealing with the challenges the industry is facing. The need to invest more in knowledge management, human resources and technology becomes more accentuated in this context”.\n\nThe Executive Chairman also participated in a panel breakout session entitled ‘Bits, bytes and withholding taxes – Why ecommerce should keep an eye on the OECD and EU’s proposals’ where he remarked that: “Attempts to tax the digital economy in a disproportionate and unfair manner runs the risk of discouraging innovation while scaring away investment from Europe.”\n\nThe MGA was also represented by its Deputy General Counsels Michele Magro and Carl Brincat. Michele Magro explained how: “The Maltese legislator came out with a law empowering the MGA to govern the digital skill game sector on the basis of the risk posed by a particular game to customers. A licensing regime also exists for games, such as fantasy sports, which are deemed by the regulator to require increased control and supervision” during a Fantasy Sports Conference entitled ‘A World of Regulatory Challenges in Collaboration with IMGL’. The following day, Carl Brincat participated in a Blockchain and Disruptive Tech Conference entitled ‘Regulating a decentralised currency: pitfalls to avoid, opportunities to embrace’ where he said that: “Our approach to cryptocurrencies and DLT shows that we embrace innovation, whilst applying a risk-based approach to ensure that our regulatory objectives are safeguarded.”\n\nThe 2017 edition of the SiGMA iGaming Summit featured over 7000 participants and more than 100 Exhibitors who benefitted from an excellent networking and knowledge sharing opportunity."

    "html": "NEWS\n22 November 2017\nThe MGA Publishes its Interim Performance Report for the Gaming Industry for the Period January to June 2017\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) has published its interim performance report for the period January to June 2017. The report reviews the performance of the gaming industry under the governance of MGA in terms of economic value added, employment, number of licensed operators and tax revenue together with developments in demand trends and in the supply capabilities of operators. The report includes an introductory section highlighting the key performance indicators for the first half of 2017 as well as a medium-term outlook into the future followed by a detailed report explaining key statistics for land-based and remote gaming sectors. Some key indicators include:\n\nThe gaming industry contributed almost 12% of the total value added of the Maltese economy during the first half of 2017, up from 11.8% during the same period last year. With over €556 million in terms of gross value added in the first half of 2017 (representing an increase of over 10% when compared to the corresponding period in 2016), the gaming industry consolidated its position as the third-largest productive sector in the economy.\nReflecting continued growth in employment, the gaming industry was directly generating in excess of 6,400 full-time equivalent jobs by June 2017. A survey carried out by the MGA towards the end of 2016 indicates that when taking into account indirect employment, the total employment in the gaming industry was estimated to be around 9,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs.\nGaming tax revenue reached €29 million in the first half of 2017, representing 5.5% of the total indirect tax intake of the Maltese Government during the period.\nThe number of companies licensed in the Maltese jurisdiction stood at 282 in June 2017, growing by 6% from December 2016, reflecting continued investment in the sector.\nLand-based gaming visits increased by 13.8% during the first half of 2017, spurred by growth in both land-based casinos and gaming parlours.\nMGA proceeded with the overhaul of the regulatory framework which will streamline, consolidate and future-proof all gaming sectors under one legislative umbrella. The new framework shall also strengthen the MGA enforcement powers and consumer protection standards.\nIn exploring the practical challenges to the implementation of the 4th Anti Money Laundering Directive to the gaming industry, MGA has performed an extensive industry outreach and collaborated closely with the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU).\nEarly in 2017, MGA published regulations for the online skill games sector thereby creating a licensing and regulatory regime for so-called ‘controlled skill games’.\nMGA continued to engage in discussions at international fora to safeguard the interests of the gaming industry in Malta.\nThe gaming industry in Malta is expected to continue growing robustly in throughout the rest of 2017 and in 2018.\n\nMGA will publish a full year industry performance report in May 2018 when it publishes its Annual Report for the financial year ending 31 December 2017.

Mr Cuschieri was invited as a keynote speaker so that he shares Malta’s long experience in regulating the online gaming industry with fellow Latin American regulators and policymakers amongst other industry leaders.\n\nThis annual event has been a leading international trade show in the gaming industry for the past 25 years and attracts senior executives, and gaming suppliers from around the world seeking new business opportunities in South America and to network with other industry professionals.As one of the leading regulators in the global gaming industry, the MGA was invited to this exhibition to outline and share its vast experience in regulatory policy, innovation, consumer protection standards and governance of the gaming sector.\n\nDuring a morning conference which featured all these topics, Mr Cuschieri stated that: “The best way to control gambling activity and its potential risks is through sound and transparent legal frameworks coupled with strong regulators ensuring proper governance and oversight of all gambling activity. It is a proven fact that prohibition in gambling doesn’t work – actually prohibition creates more problems because it drives the industry underground with far greater consequences on consumers.” He appealed to those present to analyse what happened in other jurisdictions including Malta so that effective and regulated gaming markets are created to the benefit of consumers and operators alike.\n\nThis year’s SAGSE Latin America featured over 60 exhibitors and over 6000 visitors worlwide from different sectors of the global gaming industry.\n\n "

There is a lot of interest from those attending, and many are visiting our stand to discuss the details of our new legislation, which is set to come into force in 2018. Operators are also looking positively at the innovative, yet cautious approach being taken by the Authority in the area of cryptocurrencies and DLT technologies such as blockchain, with Operators eager to evaluate the details of the sand-box approach being launched in the coming months.”\n\nCarl Brincat, Senior Legal Advisor at the MGA, participated in a round table discussion entitled ‘What’s next for Europe?’ where he spoke about the legal overhaul process taking place in Malta. He stated that: “The main objective behind the proposed overhaul which has recently been published for consultation is to consolidate and modernise the regulatory framework, moving away from a prescriptive approach towards a risk-based and technology neutral regime, which not only provides for greater convergence between the land-based and remote gaming sectors but also allows for the necessary flexibility for the Malta Gaming Authority to embrace innovation whilst safeguarding consumers. This risk-based approach is also intended to do away with unnecessary duplication, allowing the Authority to focus further on the areas which most require its regulatory oversight.”\n\nThis year’s EiG agenda focused on bringing the industry to the next level of intelligence, taking advantage of new technologies, products and concepts whilst taking into consideration what this means for legacy systems going forward."

    "html": "NEWS\n14 December 2018\nThe MGA publishes results of its Inquiry on the Consumption of Gambling and Gaming Services by Maltese Residents in 2017\nNational Lottery games remain the most prevalent form of gambling activity, 1%-2% of population reported some form of adverse effect on their lifestyle after acquiring a gambling services against payment.\n\nDuring the launch of the inquiry on the consumption of gambling and gaming services by Maltese residents that was conducted for the second time, Parliamentary Secretary for Financial Services, Digital Economy and Innovation Hon. Silvio Schembri said that the survey provides a clear picture on how all those involves can work better together to be more effective on the help provide to victims and their families.\n\nThe survey which was published by the Malta Gaming Authority takes into account economic and social considerations whilst providing an assessment of the gambling and gaming behaviours in Malta through a scientific survey carried out during 2017.\n\nWhen addressing the press conference, Hon. Schembri said that despite the fact that there’s the tendency to talk about economic growth however, at the core of the Government’s work there’s the social aspect. “The survey looks into different aspects, from how much money an individual spends every week, the average time spent by individual players in gaming activities, and the increase in the use of gaming related services” said Hon. Schembri while adding that in this way one can better move towards a holistic approach in addressing effectively social challenges gaming brings about.\n\nThe new gaming Act that was put into effect as from this year which strengthened the regulator’s work whilst putting consumer’s protection at the heart of our work. The 1%-2% of the population that admitted to having a gambling problem is very similar to the trend in Europe. “To address this issue a holistic approach is necessary hence in the coming months, the Responsible Gaming Foundation will upscale its work through the Take Action programme funded by the European Social Fund aimed at training social workers and through research amongst the victims of gambling. In this way we will have a clear picture of what is the best way forward to address effectively such issues” said Hon. Schembri while adding that the survey is going to be carried out every two years this time by the Responsible Gaming Foundation.\n\nThe MGA’s Chief Executive Officer, Heathcliff Farrugia, stressed on the importance of such scientific studies in order to properly assess the impact of gambling services consumed by the Maltese population. “Players are always at the core of all our policies, hence it is extremely important to gather as much information as possible on the gambling behaviour of punters coming from different socio-economic backgrounds, in order to be able to better achieve the cardinal regulatory objective of protecting them. This survey shows that over the last two years, there was no increase in the percentage of persons who are considered problem gamblers. Having said this, behind the statistics there are persons and families who are adversely affected and as such, it is our duty together with all those who are offering gambling services, to ensure the necessary safeguards are in place to protect and provide guidance to those in need.”\nKayne Said, from the Responsible Gaming Foundation, explained the work the Foundation has done so far since its establishment and emphasized on the importance of working together to sustain the help being given.\n\nEconomist Gordon Cordina explained some of the key highlights of the survey;\n\nThe total amount of money spent by the Maltese population on gaming services in 2017 is estimated at €128 million, an increase of €3 million over the 2015 estimate;\nNational Lottery games remain the most prevalent form of gambling activity, taking up around 73% of expenditure on gambling and gaming activities in Malta;\nAround 52.8% of the population aged 18 and over are estimated to have spent on average €11.30 per week on some form of gaming activity in 2017. The proportion of population who engages in games which are available for free is estimated at around 47.2%;\nThe average time spent by individual players in gambling and gaming activities is estimated to be around 33 minutes per week; well over half of the players spend no more than 10 minutes in playing each week, reflecting the strong component of players involved in National Lottery games;\nThe persons who engage in gambling are most likely to be young adults or senior citizens, have a secondary level of education. They are less likely to be unemployed, part-time employees or students.;\nThe share of population who reported some form of adverse effect on their lifestyle after acquiring gambling services against payment is found to be around 1% to 2% (which can vary between 1,900 and 3,800 persons). The findings of this study indicated that problems associated with gambling undertaken through regulated channels are relatively contained, in line with 2015 results;\nThe protection of consumers, minors and vulnerable persons is one of the MGA’s main objectives and is at a guiding principle at the heart of the manner in which the Authority regulates the industry. The new Gaming Act and the associated regulatory instruments, which have been introduced in 2018, further enhance consumer protection standards and responsible gambling measures with the aim of ensuring that the necessary safeguards are in place for players to gamble safely and responsibly, with the risk of addiction being curbed, and that the persons who are at risk are properly identified and helped; and;\nThe MGA also supports the Responsible Gaming Foundation, which undertakes educational and other awareness campaigns within its remit, and is operating the national gambling helpline (1777) to provide assistance to persons with issues of addiction to gambling.\n\nA full copy of the Gambling Survey Report can be accessed here."

    "html": "NEWS\n22 November 2018\nThe MGA publishes a survey to better understand existing skills gap in the gaming industry\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), through its Information Unit, has conducted a survey among its licensed remote gaming operators in order to obtain a better understanding of the existing skills gap in the gaming industry. The survey was conducted during the first quarter of 2018, and its analysis was carried out for each job category, level and firm size.\n\nThe following are the key highlights from this survey:\n\n A total of 781 unfilled positions have been reported by the remote gaming companies in Malta as at the end of 2017;\n Unfilled job vacancies are primarily in the game operation and development category at the operational level, presenting significant potential for the local educational system to contribute in addressing the issues of job vacancies in skills that are specific to the gaming industry in Malta;\n According to the survey results, 57% of respondents consider the lack of appropriate skills, in terms of either work experience or qualifications, as the main cause of unfilled vacancies;\nThe sourcing of experienced talent from other firms in Malta is practised by over 60% of surveyed firms; the majority of operators recruited workers already employed by other firms in the online sector (37%) or in other industries (24%);\nThe recruitment of workers immediately after the completion of their formal education was reported by 15% of firms, confirming the potentially stronger role which could be played by educational institutions; and;\nVarious initiatives are undertaken by the gaming companies to address the skill shortage in the industry with majority of firms (55%) organising in-house training for their employees or investing in overseas training (21%).\n\nOver the past months, several policy efforts have been made to address this skills gap. In fact, in November 2017, the European Gaming Institute of Malta (EGIM) was launched following an agreement signed between the MGA and MCAST. This strategic initiative aims to increase the talent pool in the gaming industry and create more long term careers for both local and foreign students. Educational programmes through EGIM started being offered as from October 2018.\n\nA full copy of the survey can be downloaded from here."

    "html": "NEWS\n3 December 2018\nMGA Publishes Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Directive\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority hereby notifies its licensees and the general public that in pursuant to article 7(2) of the new Gaming Act (Cap. 583 of the Laws of Malta), it is issuing the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Directive, found here, as a binding instrument in order to delineate in further detail the specific requirements in relation to Alternative Dispute Resolution.\n\nBy virtue of regulations 13 and 14 of the Player Protection Regulations, B2C licensees must make readily available to players the applicable procedures for making a complaint to them and for referring a complaint to an ADR entity. This Directive is intended to provide additional guidance to B2C licensees as to the nature of the ADR entity which B2C licensees must refer players to, and details as to the specific information which must be notified to the MGA.\n\nThose who have not yet informed the MGA as to which ADR entity they have entered into an agreement with, are to do so as soon as possible, by sending an email on support.mga@mga.org.mt with the subject “ADR Notification”, detailing the name(s) of the ADR entity or entities, and the duration of the agreement.\n\nMonthly reports which detail all the disputes which have been referred to ADR entities, including the player ID and the subject-matter of the dispute, as well as the conclusions of the ADR entities may be submitted as of 21 January 2019. More guidance as to the format which such notification should follow will be issued closer to the date.\n\nThe MGA will be distinguishing between players’ complaints and disputes. As of 1 April 2019, the MGA’s Player Support Unit will no longer be delving into the merits of a dispute between a player and a B2C licensee, since this function is reserved for the relevant ADR entity. Disputes are understood to be a disagreement between a player and the MGA B2C licensee with which that player is registered.\n\nHowever, the Player Support Unit will be open to receiving complaints from any individuals. Complaints are understood to be a report by any individual that any aspect of the provision of the gaming service by an MGA licensee is unlawful, or conducted in a manner which is not safe, fair, or transparent. In the event that the Player Support Unit receives a dispute which also includes a complaint, the Unit will be examining the complaint independently of the ADR entity, as part of its compliance functions.\n\nFurthermore, the Player Support Unit will be examining the monthly reports submitted by B2C licensees which details the disputes which have been referred to the relevant ADR entities.\n\nTo this end, B2C licensees are instructed to ensure that their player dispute procedures do not refer players to the Malta Gaming Authority, but rather to the relevant ADR entity, in accordance with Article 4 of this Directive.\n\nThis Directive is applicable as of 3 December 2018."

The report includes a section highlighting the key performance indicators for the first half of 2018 as well as a medium-term outlook into the future, followed by a detailed report explaining key statistics for land-based and remote gaming sectors.\n\nSome key indicators include:\n\nDuring the period under review, the MGA proceeded with the overhaul of the regulatory framework which will streamline, consolidate and future-proof all gaming sectors under one legislative umbrella.\nIn exploring the practical challenges of the implementation of the 4th Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Directive to the gaming industry, the Authority has performed an extensive industry outreach. In addition, the MGA has also started conducting its first AML inspections on licensed entities.\nThe MGA has undertaken a number of enforcement actions namely the issuance of 45 administrative fines. In addition, following various regulatory breaches the Authority took enforcement actions against six licensees by suspending one licence and cancelling another five.\nDuring this reporting period, the MGA’s Fit & Proper Committee refused 35 individuals, of which 10 at on-boarding and 25 through ongoing monitoring.

    "html": "NEWS\n6 February 2019\nMalta Gaming Authority commits to support the All-In Diversity Project\n\nThe All-in Diversity Project, an industry-driven initiative that aims to benchmark diversity, equality and inclusion in the global gaming sector, is proud to welcome one of the world’s leading gaming regulators as a Strategic Partner.\n\nThe MGA, one of the first jurisdictions to embrace online gaming and continue to keep pace with new technology and trends in the industry, is now turning its attention to the challenges of a changing workforce, through its new partnership with the All-In Diversity Project.\n\nMalta is one of the world’s biggest gambling hubs, boasting one of the most diverse workforces in the industry. So far this has been more by accident than design. Joining forces with the All-In Diversity Project allows for a more scientific approach. The alliance means greater exposure for the issues surrounding diversity in the betting and gambling sector in Malta and will help address issues like the skills gap, recruitment and retention of talent from the local talent pools and globally.\n\n‘’The Malta Gaming Authority is delighted to be supporting this project, as diversity, equality and inclusion are all on top of the MGA’s agenda” says Heathcliff Farrugia, the Chief Executive Officer of the Malta Gaming Authority.\n\n“Having the MGA support the All-in Diversity Project is another leap forward for our industry. Working in collaboration with leading regulatory organisations such as the Malta Gaming Authority means we can accelerate progress, share more information and offer better tools to the businesses located there. We are thrilled to have them as a partner,” says Kelly Kehn, Co-Founder of the All-In Diversity Project.\n\nAbout the Malta Gaming Authority\n\nA leader and a world-renowned regulator, the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) is considered as a ﬂagship authority within the gaming industry. Bolstering a strong worldwide reputation, the MGA regulates one of Malta’s major economic contributors; the local remote and land-based gaming industry.\n\nThe MGA regulates all types of gaming and gambling activities including national lotteries, bingo halls, casinos, gaming parlours and remote gaming. Whilst being the role model for other jurisdictions thanks to its excellent track record, the MGA always thrives to achieve its main aim; that of exceeding the expectations of its licensed operators, its business partners and its stakeholders at large. The MGA vows to regulate competently the various sectors of the gaming industry that fall under the Authority by ensuring gaming is fair and transparent to the players, preventing crime, corruption and money laundering and by protecting minor and vulnerable players.\n\nAbout All-In Diversity Project\n\nThe All-in Diversity Project is the industry’s global resource for data pertaining to diversity and inclusion. We collect data through employee surveys and the All-Index — a standard index which is set to be the definitive benchmarking tool for the gambling industry to measure progress towards inclusion in the workplace. Our vision is to shift the paradigm for inclusion through transparency, measurability and actionable tactics.

    "html": "NEWS\n12 July 2017\nThe Malta Gaming Authority Publishes a White Paper Proposing Major Reforms to Malta’s Gaming Legal Framework\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) has today published a White Paper proposing major reforms to Malta’s Gaming Legal Framework. The main objective behind this proposed overhaul is to repeal all the existing legislation and replace it with a singular primary Act of Parliament entitled the Gaming Act, together with subsidiary legislation covering horizontally the main areas of regulation as well as a series of directives and guidelines issued by the Malta Gaming Authority as the single regulator of this sector. The proposed regulatory framework empowers the MGA to be more agile in its decision-making, and decreasing unnecessary regulatory burdens which are not conducive to the regulatory objectives, whilst concurrently strengthening supervision and focusing the regulator’s efforts on the areas which present a higher risk profile. Furthermore, the proposed reform proposes the enhancement of best-in-class consumer protection standards, responsible gaming measures, a risk-based approach towards regulation and wider powers for the MGA in compliance and enforcement. It also establishes objective-orientated standards to encourage innovation and development.\n\nThese proposals are underpinned by a number of initiatives which have been undertaken throughout the preparatory period for this proposed legal overhaul, including various public consultations, technical studies and economic and financial impact assessments. They also reflect the experience which the MGA has garnered from years of experience regulating the sector. Concurrently, the proposals embrace a forward-looking regulatory ethos which seeks to ensure that regulation can cater for new potential sectors whilst reacting proportionately to societal risks.\n\nKey highlights of the changes envisaged include:\n\nReplacing the current multi-licence system with a system in which there will be two different types of licences – a Business-to-Consumer (B2C) licence and a Business-to-Business (B2B) licence – covering different types of activities across multiple distribution channels;\nMoving towards an objective-based rather than excessively prescriptive regulatory approach, to allow for innovation whilst ensuring that the regulatory objectives are attained;\nBroadening the regulatory scope to increase MGA oversight and allow for intervention where necessary and in a proportionate manner;\nWidening the MGA’s powers under the compliance and enforcement functions to better achieve the regulatory objectives, in line with concurrent developments on anti-money laundering and funding of terrorism obligations;\nSegmenting the Key Official role into various key functions within a licensed activity, requiring approval, for direct scrutiny and targeted supervisory controls, thereby raising the bar for persons of responsibility within a gaming operation;\nStrengthening the player protection framework by formalising the mediatory role of the MGA’s Player Support Unit, enshrining segregation of player funds at law and moving towards a unified self-exclusion database across both remote and land-based delivery channels;\nIntroducing new and more effective processes for criminal and administrative justice, including the allocation of appeals from decisions of the Authority to the Administrative Review Tribunal and the introduction of a distinction between administrative and criminal offences;\nIntroducing the concept of administration to protect an operation in distress and, if necessary, to assist the winding down of an operation, thereby protecting jobs and player funds;\nMoving towards automated reporting, facilitating adherence to regulatory obligations and strengthening the Authority’s oversight;\nBolstering the Authority’s role in the fight against manipulation of sports competitions by introducing new obligations on operators to monitor sports betting and report suspicious bets, in line with the efforts being made by the National Anti-Corruption Task Force in which the Authority also participates actively;\nStreamlining taxation into one flow with two main layers; and\nExempting B2B licensees from gaming tax, thus increasing Malta’s competitiveness as a hub for these services providers.\n\nQueries and requests for clarifications with respect to the content of the document, as well as contributions/feedback from interested parties may be sent by email to legaloverhaul.mga@mga.org.mt or in writing to:\n\nDr Edwina Licari\nChief Officer – Legal and EU/International Affairs\nMalta Gaming Authority\nBuilding SCM 02-03, Level 4,\nSmartCity Malta,\nRicasoli SCM1001,\nMalta.\n\nClosing date for feedback on the aforementioned consultation is Wednesday, 23rd August, 2017.\n\n "

    "html": "NEWS\n12 July 2017\nParliamentary Secretary for Financial Services, Digital Economy & Innovation, Hon. Silvio Schembri Visits the MGA\n\nThe Parliamentary Secretary responsible for Financial Services, Digital Economy, and Innovation, Hon. Silvio Schembri MP visited the Malta Gaming Authority offices at Smart City Malta, on Wednesday 12thJuly 2017. Parliamentary Secretary Schembri was welcomed by the MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri and was given an opportunity to tour the premises and meet the Authority’s employees and senior management. The visit was concluded with a press conference where a number of important strategic initiatives were announced to the press.\n\nThe Executive Chairman of the MGA opened the press conference by announcing the public consultation document for a new legal framework to govern the different aspects of gaming activities in Malta. The main objective behind the proposed overhaul is to repeal, in its entirety, the existing framework and replace it with a singular, primary Act of Parliament entitled “The Gaming Act” which will run parallel with subsidiary legislation, directives and guidelines pertaining to the regulation and governance of the sector.\n\nThe primary aims of the proposed regulatory framework include the raising of Malta’s jurisdictional profile through the enhancement of best-in-class consumer protection standards, responsible gaming measures, a risk-based approach towards regulation and wider powers for the MGA in compliance and enforcement. Furthermore, the new framework establishes objective-orientated standards to encourage innovation and development. Proposed measures include a streamlined licensing process and a more stringent, risk-based compliance procedure.\n\nAddressing the press conference, Mr Cuschieri stated that “We conducted a lot of research and commissioned numerous studies and consultations with all stakeholders to make sure the new legislation is future proof and addresses the challenges the industry is facing. Innovative and business-friendly regulation should never come at the expense of transparency and consumer protection. After all, companies want to operate in a properly regulated environment where consumer protection, crime prevention, integrity and transparency are at the heart of the regulatory ethos”.\n\nParliamentary Secretary Schembri said, “The consultation process we are launching today with this White Paper is part of this government electoral manifesto, as a key initiative to keep strengthening the gaming industry as a very important sector of Malta’s digital economy. The new legal framework must by dynamic and future proof to allow for the use of cryptocurrency in the remote gaming sector within the coming months. We must act fast to remain at the forefront of worldwide gaming jurisdictions guaranteeing a secure hub for this industry and an efficient infrastructure that gives confidence to gaming companies setting up their operation on our shores. It is imperative that this reform leads us to new policies that encourage further innovation and development within the sector.”\n\nMr Cuschieri also spoke about a public consultation which was launched earlier this week in conjunction with the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit on the implementation of The Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive within the gaming sector. The consultation will address the new rules and supervisory mechanisms applicable to subject persons and entities (See attached link)\n\nThe MGA also announced that the Authority has commissioned a detailed study on cryptocurrencies in order to assist in the development of a proper framework governing the use of cryptocurrencies in the remote gaming sector in light also of the requirements of the 4AMLD. Mr Cuschieri stated that the MGA is committed to allowing the use of crypto-currencies for the gaming sector by not later than Q1 2018. As Malta stands at the forefront of not just the gaming sector, but the digital economy in general, the MGA must take relevant steps to stay abreast of digital and technological evolution.\n\n "

Silvio Schembri, the MGA announced the launch of a New Licensee Relationship Management System accessible through a secure and dedicated web portal.\n\nThis project, which is the result of a collaboration between the MGA and Microsoft, will transform the way the MGA interacts with its current and prospective licensees through the simplification and digitisation of its online and land-based processes.\n\nThe first phase of the project will see the MGA launching three main online services which are:\n\nApplications for Remote Gaming Licences,\nDynamic Seal URL requests, and,\nSubmission of Players Liability and Gaming Tax Reports.\n\nThis new system will empower the gaming operators to electronically track the status of their applications and meet regulatory requirements more efficiently. This digitisation process will enhance a two-way communication between the Authority and its customers.\n\nThe Authority is embarking on this process to progress dynamically and create an enhanced, easier-to-use process.\n\nThe MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri stated that; “The Malta Gaming Authority is taking another step towards achieving efficiency and innovation in the way it conducts its function as a regulator by applying information technology in regulatory processes. This project further aids the Authority in providing a top end service to its licensees and practitioners alike. Our main objective remains; that of exceeding the expectations of all our stakeholders at large. This portal goes a long way in achieving that”.\n\nIn his speech, Parliamentary Secretary Silvio Schembri said that the Malta Gaming Authority is being proactive by always improving the services provided to companies operating in the gaming industry. “Today, the MGA is launching a new system by which it will be facilitating the communication with clients applying for a gaming licence on our shores. This system will function via an online portal improving the efficiency of the Authority’s regulatory process. This project forms part of the government’s vision for the improvement of our gaming jurisdiction. With similar initiatives, the Authority is excelling in the service given to those wishing to invest in our country, whereby said service always exceeds the expectations of the vast majority of operators.”\n\nThe new Licensee Relationship Management System will be the one-stop shop for licensing. This is mirrored in the next phase of the project whereby the Authority will be extending the system to land-based operations including but not limited to; casinos, gaming parlours, the national lottery and commercial bingo."

Its mission is to advance the effectiveness and efficiency of gaming regulation by providing a forum in which gaming regulators from around the world can meet, exchange views and information, and discuss policy issues with representatives of the international gaming industry. IAGR is also a central point of cooperation among international regulators but also a contact for inquiries from governments, gaming regulatory agencies and personnel, and representatives of the international gaming industry.\n\nThe MGA’s Executive Chairman Mr. Joseph Cuschieri participated in a panel discussing the regulation of the digital market with counterparts from the UK and the Isle of Man and other experts. The panel discussion focused on how regulators grapple with new technologies and innovations as they cross over into the regulated gambling space. In his interventions on the panel, Mr Cuschieri explained how regulators need to embrace new technologies and create the right regulatory environment for innovation to foster. He added that regulatory agencies need to apply new technologies such as DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) to achieve more efficacy in the regulatory system. Regulators should not see new technologies as threats but as opportunities for innovation and improvement.\n\nDuring the panel, Mr Cuschieri announced that in early Q1 2018, the MGA will be publishing two detailed position documents – one on the virtual currency sandbox launch and another on the application of DLT (blockchain) technology in the provision of gaming services by licensed entities."

    "html": "NEWS\n25 May 2017\nMGA Reacts To International Media Articles\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) makes reference to a number of media articles which appeared on various international online news portals. The MGA strongly objects to the articles in question which contain factual inaccuracies and a misleading portrayal of the Malta Gaming Authority and the way it operates. The articles in question are based on unfounded allegations by an ex-employee of the MGA (Valery Atanasov, a Bulgarian national) with whom the Authority has a pending case currently being heard in front of the Industrial Tribunal over his dismissal from the Authority following a decision by an independent disciplinary board.\n\nThe comments centre around an outdated process called ‘sealing’, a legacy and internal (non-critical) procedure which has since been discontinued in light of technological developments and innovations e.g. cloud solutions. On the other hand, the process of tagging (of equipment) was retained for inventory control purposes. The Authority employs various other procedures which include third party technical audits and spot checks, data extractions, 24/7 CCTV monitoring at data centres, lab certificates of critical components (e.g. servers), website/data centre traffic monitoring and verification of replication procedures for data not hosted in Malta. This provides the Authority with sufficient assurances and capability to conduct its supervisory functions effectively including any potential tampering with equipment. The Authority also audits its licensees information security procedures and processes against an internal manual largely adopted from international technical standards such as ISO 27001. This provides far more comprehensive protection than any physical sealing. It is pertinent to point out that servers can also be located overseas in line with the freedoms established under the EU treaty and hence the shift in ensuring that such servers are located in ISO certified data centre facilities having world class standards including ongoing surveillance and 24/7 CCTV monitoring.\n\nThe Authority like any other regulator, acting in the public interest, has a number of discretionary powers on how to execute its functions by virtue of policies and procedures which are underpinned by a risk based approach, designed to follow a regulatory logic to achieve the regulatory objectives at play. As a dynamic and innovative regulator, the Malta Gaming Authority keeps its processes constantly under review to ensure that regulatory processes are in sync with developments in the industry both in terms of technological advancements and regulatory performance. The Authority makes it clear that there is absolutely no link between tax evasion or money laundering with respect to the outdated practice of sealing or tagging of equipment. The Authority has other mechanisms in place to supervise tax compliance and money laundering in line with the pertinent legislation. Any media statements to the contrary are based solely on misinformation, poor knowledge of the gaming sector or worse, misleading information. The implementation of the new EU 4AMLD (Fourth Anti-money Laundering Directive) including attendant supervisory mechanisms later on this year will further strengthen the Authority’s oversight in this area.\n\nFor a downloadable version of this press release, please click here."

Joseph Cuschieri, Executive Chairman of the MGA said “We are delighted that a prestigious operator and brand like Skybet applied for a license with the MGA. It is encouraging to see that Malta’s reputation as a gaming jurisdiction is recognised by world leading brands. The Authority is committed to addressing the ongoing evolution of the industry and its future challenges with integrity, transparency and a focus on consumer protection. The fact that Skybet applied for a license in Malta is testimony to our reputation and encourages us to keep raising the bar in innovation, governance and thought leadership in gaming regulation”\n\nThe MGA is also publishing regulatory data for the first four months of 2017. The information shows that during the period Jan – Apr 2017 there was a 79% increase in license applications and a 33% increase in licenses issued compared to the first four months of 2016. Furthermore, the MGA registered an increase in enforcement activity between the same period over the last three years.\n\nThese figures show that the integrity of Malta’s jurisdiction coupled with the MGA’s regulatory ethos is key in the attractiveness of Malta as a global place of establishment for remote gaming operators. Furthermore, these figures show that the MGA’s compliance and enforcement activities over the last two years have been sharpened further due to enhanced supervision and monitoring of gaming activities. These figures do not include instances where the MGA refuses renewals of expired licenses based on fit and proper issues or the compliance track record of the respective licensee. The upsurge in applications is based on an increase in traditional gaming products but also the recently introduced Skill Games Regulations e.g. fantasy sports.\n\nJan – Apr 2017\n\n\t2015\t2016\t2017\tChange 2017 vs 2016\nApplications received\t39\t33\t59\t+26\nLicenses issued\t28\t27\t36\t+9\nNo. of administrative fines issued.\t27\t9\t14\t+5\nTerminated & cancelled licenses\t16\t20\t12\t-8\nSuspended\t7\t2\t1\t-1\n\nAbout Sky Betting & Gaming:\n\nHeadquartered in Leeds and led by Chief Executive, Richard Flint, Sky Betting & Gaming was formed in 2001 and has since grown to become one of the UK’s leading online bookmakers, with a team of 1200 employees and a strong track record of innovation. With additional offices in Sheffield, London, Rome and Munich the business has expanded internationally into Italy and has plans to do the same in Germany soon.\n\nAs one of the first bookmakers to recognise the potential of online and then mobile platforms for betting and gaming, Sky Betting & Gaming today operates five major online products – Bet, Vegas, Casino, Poker, and Bingo – as well as leading sports affiliate Oddschecker. Its success means it has risen to be the biggest online player by customer numbers in the UK market. In 2015 Sky Betting and Gaming became an independent company following the sale of its majority share by its parent company Sky to CVC Capital Partners, one of the world’s leading private equity houses in a deal which valued Sky Betting and Gaming at £800million. Sky has entered into a long-term brand license agreement and other commercial arrangements with Sky Betting and Gaming in connection with the sale.\n\nFor a downloadable version of this press release, please click here."

    "html": "NEWS\n8 June 2017\nThe National Statistics Office Publishes its Quarterly Report – The Gaming Sector Continues to Grow\n\nThe gaming industry continued to grow sustainably during the first quarter of 2017. This was reflected in an increase in the number of remote gaming licence applications received, from 22 in Q1/2016 to 44 in Q1/2017. Furthermore, the MGA issued 26 remote gaming licences during the first quarter of 2017 compared to 14 licences issued during the corresponding period of 2016. The number of Maltese gaming licences continued to increase reaching 543 as at the end of March 2017.\n\nProvisional estimates published by the National Statistics Office (NSO)[1] indicate that the gaming industry directly contributed 13% of the total economic gross value added (GVA) generated in the Maltese economy during the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 10% compared to the first quarter of 2016 reaching a total GVA of €277m. Employment in the gaming sector also increased by 16% during the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 reaching a total of 5,458 employees. The latter figure does not include indirect employment in the gaming sector. It must be noted that the contributions identified by the NSO refer solely to gaming services activity and do not take into account the indirect contribution which the gaming industry is making to other sectors of the economy such as ICT and real estate as a result of its establishment in Malta.\n\nMGA Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri said: “While the MGA acknowledges the positive results achieved during the first quarter of 2017, the Authority is committed to its continuous improvement programme to enhance its service delivery, governance and supervision of all gaming activities in and from Malta. Our priority remains to ensure fairness of games, protection of minors and vulnerable persons and the prevention of crime, fraud and money laundering. Our key focus for the coming years shall be to raise quality & standards across all gaming sectors, raise the bar in the overall governance and supervision of the gaming sector, engage and build partnerships with other jurisdictions, key stakeholders and regulators, explore new growth areas including niche gaming sectors and innovations and enhance consumer protection mechanisms and empowerment”.\n\nFor a downloadable version of this press release please click here.\n\n[1] National Statistics Office – Malta, News Release 093/2017\n\n "

    "html": "NEWS\n21 June 2017\nThe Malta Gaming Authority Publishes a Survey into the Consumption of Gaming Services by Maltese Residents\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) has for the first time published a survey into the consumption of gaming services by Maltese residents, including economic and social considerations. The scientific survey which was carried out between 2015 and 2016 provides a fair assessment of the gambling behaviours in Malta. It also gives a clearer picture on the level of problem gambling in Malta.\n\nThe survey was announced and published during a press conference which was held at the Office of the Prime Minister, which was addressed by Hon Silvio Schembri, Parliamentary Secretary for Financial Services, Digital Economy and Innovation and the MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri.\n\nHon Schembri said, that this survey was needed in order to understand fully the effect of gambling behaviour on the social life of the Maltese population, as well as understanding the economic impact this has on their every day life. Whilst recognizing the positive effects of the Igaming industry on the Maltese economy, Hon Schembri stressed the importance of the government’s role in devising policies to safeguard this activity without impacting our society negatively. The Parliamentary Secretary also mentioned the important work carried out by the Responsible Gaming Foundation which launched a series of initiatives to help people with gambling problems, such as the 1777 helpline and self barring forms. Hon Schembri also thanked the Malta Gaming Authority for this initiative, which will provide a scientific basis for policies aimed at helping people who have gambling problems.\n\nThe MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri highlighted the importance of this survey, “For the first time we are publishing a scientific survey which clearly articulates the gambling behaviours of the Maltese population. This should help all stakeholders to shape policies based on scientific data rather than impressions or myths hence a more informed debate about the economic and social effects of gambling in Malta. The survey also gives size and scale of potential gambling addiction problems in Malta”.\n\nKey highlights from this survey include:\n\nGaming services have become an essential component of household recreational activities. This entails a contribution to economic activity, and needs to be managed in a way which does not impinge upon the sustainability of lifestyles,\nThe Maltese population is estimated to have spent around €125 million in gaming services during 2015, equivalent to around 2.8% of total household consumption expenditure,\nNational Lottery games are the most prevalent form of gaming, closely followed by expenditure on gaming parlours and outlets,\nAround 195,300 persons are estimated to have spent money on some form of gaming activity in 2015, which is close to 56% of the population aged 18 years and over. The average weekly expenditure by these persons stood at €12.30. Around 46% of the population engages in games available for free,\nThe persons who engage in paid gaming activities are most likely those who are aged 45 and over, having an educational attainment up to Secondary level and not active in the labour market,\nIn general, around 1% to 2% of the population (which can vary between 2,000 and 4,000 persons) who acquire gaming services for payment reports some type of adverse effect between gaming activity and lifestyle. The findings of this study indicate that problems associated with gaming activities undertaken through regular channels are relatively contained. This is in line with the trends in other EU jurisdictions,\nThis implies that, more likely than not, more extensive and serious problems associated with gambling would be emanating primarily from illegal activities,\nNGOs involved in social issues in relation to gambling emphasise the need for further resources to be dedicated to training of professionals in the area of gambling addictions,\nIn line with these considerations, responsible gambling remains a top priority in guiding the MGA’s regulatory ethos and policy objectives.\n\nWhoever wishes to receive the complete version of the survey may send an email to info.mga@mga.org.mt."

    "html": "NEWS\n26 June 2017\nThe Malta Gaming Authority Publishes its 2016 Annual Report and Financial Statements – Future Proofing for Sustainability\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) has published its Annual Report and Financial Statements for the financial year ending 31 December 2016. The report provides an overview of the activities and work performed throughout the year by the MGA which was focused on the achievement of its vision, mainly driven by the repositioning strategy and the general overhaul of the regulatory regime which will be published for consultation this year. Furthermore, the MGA carried on its continuous improvement programme which is aimed at the strengthening of its internal functions, knowledge management and the efficiency of its core business processes.\n\nThe Report also glances at 2017 and beyond, being a year of transition for the Authority and for the Maltese gaming sector, whereby all the work done in the strategic repositioning exercise will come to fruition through the publication of the upcoming new gaming legislative framework.\n\nThe following are the key highlights from the Annual Report:\n\nDuring the year under review, the MGA generated a total revenue of €62.5m compared to €60.9m in 2015. This represents an increase of €1.6m or a 2.6% year-on-year increase. Furthermore, contributions in gaming taxes made to Government in 2016 amounted to €56.2m compared to €55.8m in 2015. This represents an increase of €0.4m or a 0.7% increase year-on-year,\nThe gaming industry is estimated to have generated just over €1 billion in terms of gross value added in 2016. This represented a 12% growth over 2015, when the industry had already increased its gross value added by a similar amount. As a result of these developments, the gaming industry increased its share in economic activity to around 11.6% in 2016,\nThe number of remote gaming licenses has increased to 513, representing a 5% year on year increase,\nThe industry directly accounts for almost 6,200 jobs in full time equivalent terms by the end of 2016, an increase of almost 1,500 jobs over 2015. When one factors in indirect employment through associated businesses, the number increases to around 9,000 jobs in 2016.\nIn 2016, the Authority proceeded with the work on the overhaul of its regulatory framework which was started in early 2015 and which will come into force in 2018. The new licensing framework will target more effectively the development of business-to-business activities, enhance the efficiency of regulatory processes across all areas of activity and introduce the flexibility needed to meet current and future dynamics with respect to technological developments, consumer protection standards and market demands (current and future),\nThe Authority also enhanced its focus on key success factors for Malta as a jurisdiction by undertaking relevant studies in line with its vision to become an increasingly knowledge-driven organisation. Among the areas analysed by the MGA during 2016 included the availability of human resources and skills to sustain the operations of the industry, the threats and opportunities associated with the consumption of gaming services by Maltese residents, and the role of cryptocurrencies in gaming activities,\nDuring the year under review, the MGA further enhanced its compliance methodologies in view of the increased global focus on the gaming industry. This involved stepping up collaboration with the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit with respect to anti-money laundering initiatives and the implementation of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive,\nIn 2016, the MGA continued with its technology and information systems programme development which included the implementation of a Customer Relationship Management system which will enable the organisation to handle operator requests more effectively, whilst allowing more efficient interactions to take place between the industry and the Authority,\nDuring 2016 the Authority placed a strong emphasis on effective enforcement, including a substantial rise in inspections on land-based operators and a marked increase in cancellations of remote gaming licenses,\nThe Authority’s focus for the years ahead shall be focused on enhancing consumer protection mechanisms; raising quality standards across all gaming sectors; improve the overall governance and supervision of the sector; engage and build partnerships with other jurisdictions, stakeholders and regulators; and explore new growth areas including niche gaming sectors and innovations.\n\nIn publishing this report, Joseph Cuschieri, Chairman of the Malta Gaming Authority, said, “I feel proud of the Authority’s achievements during the year under review.  These achievements engender a strong sense of responsibility for the Authority to ensure a continued, safe and sustainable growth of the industry, in a challenging global environment. It also drives us to reach new heights in our regulatory ethos, thought leadership, standards of regulation and innovation in our approach as a regulator”.\n\nWhoever wishes to receive hard copies of the Annual Report may send an email to info.mga@mga.org.mt"

Both authorities have also agreed to provide the best possible operational assistance to one another, on a continuous basis, in accordance with both their respective procedures and regulatory policies.\n\nThe Director General of the Swedish Gambling Authority, Camilla Rosenberg said that: “Many of the companies that have received a Swedish license also have technical equipment and a license in Malta. By opening the communication channels between the authorities we become stronger in our supervisory activities. This is the beginning of a broad and long-term cooperation, and our plan is to initiate corresponding collaborations with more gambling authorities in Europe.”\n\nThe MGA’s Chief Executive Officer, Heathcliff Farrugia, also expressed his satisfaction on this agreement whereby he stated that: “The MGA is always actively seeking to foster relationships with fellow authorities and other international regulatory bodies as we firmly believe that such relationships are key to reaching our objectives, especially in the area of remote gaming which is fundamentally cross-border in nature.  This MoU, signed with the Swedish Gambling Authority, is an important step towards achieving both our respective regulatory goals in vital areas of mutual interest, especially since the MGA and the Swedish Gambling Authority share a significant number of operators licensed by both regulators. We are eager to start this mutually beneficial journey with our Swedish counterpart.”\n\nThe MoU came into force as of the 4 of March 2019."

The PMC document may be accessed via the Maltese Government’s Electronic Public Procurement System (ePPS). All submissions are also to be sent through the ePPS.\n\nResponsible gaming is a key priority within the MGA’s regulatory policy development and framework. Following upon the White Paper to Future Proof Malta’s Gaming Legal Framework published in July 2017, the MGA is pursuing tools and means to further strengthen the protection afforded to players. These initiatives include the recently published Player Protection Directive, and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Directive, as well as our declared intent to launch a Unified Self-Exclusion System across gambling operators, irrespective of channel.\n\nThe MGA envisages that a Unified Self-Exclusion System would be a significant step forward in the MGA’s agenda to implement further control for the prevention of gambling-related harm, extending the criteria in Part IV of the Player Protection Directive, and Part IV of the Gaming Premises Regulations. The scope and high-level specifications of the Unified Self-Exclusion System can be accessed via the PMC document.\n\nInterested parties are encouraged to follow the following steps:\n\nRegister through etenders.gov.mt in order to receive and submit a response to this PMC;\nSearch for MGA/PMC/01/2019 in the ‘Search’ tab.\n\nImportant: Interested parties may wish to contact the MGA for support on pmc.mga@mga.org.mt should difficulties to register correctly or upload/download documents from the ePPS, persist.\n\nThe closing date for this preliminary market consultation process is 31 May 2019."

    "html": "NEWS\n1 July 2019\nThe MGA Publishes its 2018 Annual Report and Financial Statements\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) has published its Annual Report and Financial Statements for the financial year ending 31 December 2018. The report provides an overview of the activities and work performed throughout the year by the MGA. Furthermore, the report includes a detailed summary of the performance of the Maltese gaming industry during 2018 as well as a medium-term outlook into the future.\n\nThroughout 2018, the MGA mainly focused on the implementation of the new Gaming Act which empowered the Authority to further strengthen its regulatory oversight. Furthermore, the MGA focused on the regulatory compliance through implementation of a number of innovative internal and external initiatives which improved overall governance and supervision of the gaming sector. In 2018, the Authority continued to further strengthen its Anti-Money Laundering/Combating Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) supervision, in order to ensure effectiveness in the mitigation of ML/FT risks relating to gambling services.\n\nThe Annual Report also looks at 2019 and beyond, with the MGA continuing to reinforce its compliance, risk and enforcement functions to ensure that it is equipped to achieve the regulatory objectives which the law requires it to pursue.\n\nThe following are the key highlights from the Annual Report:\n\nIn 2018, the MGA and the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) jointly issued the Remote Gaming Implementing Procedures – Part II that were directed toward the remote gaming sector. Throughout the year, both Authorities participated in cooperative initiatives to strengthen the oversight of the gaming sector;\nThroughout 2018, the MGA conducted a total of 33 AML/CFT full-scope examinations, eight of which were conducted jointly with the FIAU;\nDuring 2018, the Authority placed a strong emphasis on effective enforcement. To this effect, the MGA has issued 16 Notices of Reprimand and 73 Notices of Breach, suspended four licences and cancelled another eight. In addition, a total of 139 administrative fines were imposed on operators following various regulatory breaches;\nIn 2018, the MGA’s Fit & Proper Committee deemed 63 individuals or companies to be unsuitable for a licence, or for a significant role in a licensee, as the case may be. In particular, 37 of these were related to individuals or companies considered as not having satisfied the integrity and reputation pillars of the MGA’s fit and proper criteria due to possible connections to money laundering or funding of terrorism. Around 2,000 criminal probity screenings were conducted during the course of 2018;\nIn 2018, the Authority set up a Commercial Communications Committee as required in terms of the new regulatory framework, ensuring due process in the assessment of regulatory breaches stemming from the requirements relating to commercial communications. During the year, a total of 14 cases were evaluated, out of which seven decisions determined that there had been a breach of the regulations;\nThe Authority received 209 applications for a licence and issued 93 licences to gaming operators, with the remaining ones still going through the acceptance process. A total of eight licence applications were rejected during 2018;\nDuring the year under review, the MGA continued its digitisation efforts, including further updates to the Licensee Relationship Management System to cater for the submission of the Monthly Licence and Compliance Contribution Report. Additional functionalities will be added on the portal throughout 2019; and,\nIn line with its vision to become an increasingly knowledge-driven organisation, the Authority conducted and published the results of two major surveys in 2018. The areas analysed by the MGA included the skills gap in the gaming industry and the threats and opportunities associated with the consumption of gambling and gaming services by Maltese residents.\n\nIn publishing this report, Heathcliff Farrugia, Chief Executive Officer of the Malta Gaming Authority, stated that: “2018 was a remarkable year for the Authority, predominantly because of the coming into force of the new law on the 1 August 2018. The new framework strengthened the MGA’s supervisory role, specifically in the areas of compliance and enforcement, enabling it to focus efforts on areas which present a higher risk profile.\n\nThe new regulatory regime has also been pivotal in ensuring the Authority could become more agile in its decision-making.\n\nLast year was also the year when Malta adopted the EU’s 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, which saw online gaming companies in Malta becoming obliged entities for the first time. This was challenging, both for licensees and the MGA, which together with the FIAU, started conducting onsite AML inspections.\n\nIn 2019, the MGA’s focus will be that of consolidating what has been built so far, and continue building on its regulatory powers, to ensure holistic regulatory oversight focusing on the integrity of market participants and the protection of consumers, whilst also embracing technological innovation without prejudicing the attainment of its regulatory objectives.”\n\nWhoever wishes to receive hard copies of the Annual Report may send an email to info.mga@mga.org.mt "

    "url": "https://www.mga.org.mt/skill-games-regulations-fantasy-sports-ruling/",
    "html": "NEWS\n30 January 2017\nSkill Games Regulations & Fantasy Sports Ruling\n\nThe Skill Games Regulations (S.L. 438.11) are now in force following publication in the Government Gazette on the 24th of January 2017. In terms of these new regulations, the Authority is entrusted with the governance and regulation over the skill games sector, as originally envisaged under article 78 of the Lotteries and Other Games Act (Chapter 438 of the Laws of Malta).\n\nThe publication of these regulations follows a public consultation that was carried out in 2015. The Authority collected and analysed the feedback received, and met with industry stakeholders, and a position paper was published in December 2015, laying down the Authority’s roadmap for the regulation of this sector. The legislative process was undertaken in 2016, which included notification to the European Commission in terms of the process laid down by Directive 2015/1535.\n\nIn terms of the Skill Games Regulations, the Authority is empowered to regulate the sector in terms of a number of public policy objectives listed down in regulation 3, including consumer protection, fairness of the game, and the prevention of criminality.\n\nFurthermore, skill games which, in the opinion of the Authority, should be subject to additional regulatory supervision because of any additional risk they may pose to consumers, may, by virtue of a public ruling issued by the Authority in terms of regulation 6, be deemed ‘controlled skill games’, and thus become subject to the requirement of a licence, and the rest of the obligations envisaged in the regulations.\n\nIn view of the above, the Authority is hereby exercising this power to deem fantasy sports as controlled skill games. The ruling on fantasy sports, and the parameters thereof, are attached. The effects of this ruling, together with the repealing of the Fantasy Sports (Exemption) Regulations (S.L. 438.10), are that such fantasy sports operators are required to acquire a controlled skill games licence from the Authority.\n\nA controlled skill games licence may be a licence to provide a service for the purposes of engaging with end consumers, or a licence to provide a supply, that is, in a business-to-business capacity. The licence is valid for five years, and is subject to a number of requirements, including a procedure to ensure that the persons behind the business are fit and proper, financial and system auditing to ensure that the operation is fair, sound and secure, and other measures to prevent fraud and money-laundering, a consumer-centric approach to the business, a high level of information security and segregation of player funds. Licence holders are also subject to administrative fees, licence fees, and a 5% tax over gaming revenue. A three-month transitory period is in effect.\n\nStakeholders are invited to access the Skill Games page on the Authority’s website for further resources on this new framework, and to contact the Authority for further assistance."

The visit coincided with the recent enactment of the Swedish gambling licensing regime, as well as the overhaul of the Maltese gambling regime in August 2018 and was thus an opportune time for exchange of best practices between the two regulators. Furthermore, deeper collaboration between the two authorities serves well as a large number of operators are regulated by both regulators.\n\nFollowing a tour of the MGA offices and a discussion revolving around the Authority’s Directorates and staffing, the MGA and the Spelinspektionen held presentations and discussions over two days regarding regulatory functions and objectives common to both organisations, including anti-money laundering, criminal probity and fitness & propriety, financial suitability, player protection and player support, responsible gaming, data & statistics, IT systems deployed by the regulators and sports integrity amongst other regulatory issues.\n\nFollowing a number of visits from other delegations earlier this year, the MGA is constantly welcoming such opportunities as they are the ideal platform for both knowledge sharing and mutual collaboration and discussions."

The law is of relevance to the land-based casino sector, and establishes the procedures and parameters to be followed by casino licence holders in organising large scale poker tournaments and festivals, when such events are organised outside the casino gaming area.\n\nPoker tournaments and festivals may be organised by casino licence holders in areas that are next to, or adjoining the casino premises, or part of the same complex, and shall be subject to prior approval from the Malta Gaming Authority. The approval given by the Authority will be temporary and which shall not exceed fourteen days. The Authority will be performing checks on the area which will be utilised for the poker tournament, including all access points. Further checks include the conditions of the tournament, such as maximum number of participants, registration fee and estimated prize-pool, the rules of the game, control of access arrangements and security. The Authority will also require documentation relating to parties supplying critical services, including those on behalf of whom the tournament may be organised.\n\nAn application for a poker tournament shall be submitted on the attached forms by the casino licence holder, and the application shall be submitted at least thirty days before the poker tournament. An application fee of €300 applies, together with a daily inspection fee of €700 for the duration of the tournament.\n\nIn order for a person to perform work in relation to a poker tournament, said person needs to hold a casino employee licence as provided in the Gaming Act Regulations (S.L. 400.01), or a Poker Tournament Dealer Licence issued in terms of the new Regulations. Unlike casino employee licenses, Poker Tournament Dealer licenses are not tied to a specific casino licence holder, and are valid for a year.

    "html": "NEWS\n3 October 2019\nSanctions Monitoring Board (SMB) – Guidance Note on Targeted Financial Sanctions In Malta \n\nThe MGA is hereby issuing the below guidance note on behalf of the Sanctions Monitoring Board (SMB) as per legal obligations and for your respective reference. Any queries which arise from the below should be solely directed to the SMB respectively on sanctions.mftp@gov.mt \n\nThis guidance note is produced by the Sanctions Monitoring Board (SMB) as the competent authority for the implementation of financial sanctions in the Republic of Malta.\n\nThe SMB’s website is: www.foreign.gov.mt/SMB and the SMB may be contacted at: sanctions.mftp@gov.mt\n\nGuidance – October 2019\n\nAll EU/UN sanctions are directly applicable under Maltese law under the National Interest (Enabling Powers) Act, cap 365 of the Laws of Malta as linked hereunder:\n\nhttp://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lom&itemid=8835&l=1\n\nThere is an obligation imposed  on all economic operators to be aware of applicable sanctions and to make all necessary checks to ensure that sanctions  are complied with at all times. Should any situation be encountered which is in violation of sanctions, whether directly or indirectly, there is an obligation to stop any transaction from going through, freeze any assets and inform the SMB. The freezing of assets obligation is covered by the “Guidance on Asset Freezing Obligations  under the National Interest (Enabling Powers) Act” which can be found on the web page of the SMB linked hereunder:\n\nhttps://foreignaffairs.gov.mt/en/Government/SMB/Pages/Sanctions-Monitoring-Board.aspx\n\nThe SMB has launched a service through which amendments to international sanctions lists are communicated to subject persons. If you wish to receive these updates please send an e-mail to sanctions.mftp@gov.mt expressing your interest.\n\nThe aforementioned service is part of an approach to conduct more outreach activities with subject persons, normally by sector. The SMB would like to take this opportunity to highlight to all subject persons that any query regarding sanctions must be provided to the SMB in writing and not communicated through any other means.\n\nIf a subject person has a doubt as to whether a specific transaction or activity is exclusively a sanctions issue, the SMB suggests that subject persons report to each competent authority according to its respective mandate. Any sanctions related issue must be dealt with and reported to the SMB, and the SMB must emphasize that sanctions breaches are of a criminal nature under the laws of Malta and will be investigated and prosecuted to the full extent of the law when found.\n\nThe National Interest (Enabling Powers) Act provides the legal basis for the SMB’s endeavours under Maltese law. This law has been amended and will continue to be  amended as necessary in order to meet the national interest which, in this case, concerns the robust implementation of all national and international sanctions legislation in the Republic of Malta. This law defines, in detail, the criminal nature of sanctions breaches and evasion attempts, and also provides an obligation on all economic operators in Malta to:\n\n“have in place and effectively implement internal controls and procedures to ensure compliance with the obligations arising from this Act and any relevant United Nations or European Union Resolutions or regulations;”  – Chapter 365, Article 17.6.(b)\n\nIn practice, this means that every subject person is obliged to implement, in full, all national and international sanctions legislation. Subject persons must immediately notify the Board in case an action is taken in relation to sanctions legislation. Where a subject person does not rely on automated mechanisms or analytical systems, the obligations remain. Therefore, each subject person must carefully consider its risk profile and weigh the obligations of sanctions legislation with its own investment in sanctions compliance tools and personnel.\n\nThe SMB would also like to take this opportunity to highlight that several sectors of subject persons, especially some Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs), were deemed by the MoneyVal assessment to have an “insufficient” approach to sanctions compliance, and this is further emphasized as several DNFBPs “…were not aware at all of freezing or reporting obligations.” Furthermore, when a potential sanctions issue arises and a subject person “…simply refuse[s] the transaction or exit[s] the customer relationship”, this undermines the rigorous implementation of sanctions legislation in Malta and rather than refusing the transaction or exiting a customer relationship, the relevant due diligence is to be made by the economic operator and the SMB advised accordingly.\n\nFor any questions the SMB may be contacted at sanctions.mftp@gov.mt\n\nPlease find below links to the:\n\nEU Financial Sanctions Database\nhttps://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/consolidated-list-of-persons-groups-and-entities-subject-to-eu-financial-sanctions\nConsolidated UN Sanctions List\nhttps://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/un-sc-consolidated-list\nEU Sanctions Map\nhttps://www.sanctionsmap.eu/#/main\nSanctions Monitoring Board\nhttp://www.foreign.gov.mt/smb"

In 2017, the European Gaming Institute of Malta (EGIM) was launched following an agreement signed between the MGA and Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology (MCAST). In 2018, 56 students applied for the iGaming Diploma at MCAST, and an additional 43 enrolled between January and mid-November 2019;\nBy mid-November 2019, 58 students enrolled for the Award in iGaming course at the iGaming Academy – a joint collaboration between the MCAST and EGIM;\nIn 2019, 21 students were selected and matched with seven companies through the Gaming Malta’s Student Placement Programme, an initiative that aims to reduce the mismatch which exists between the supply and demand for gaming skills in the Maltese labour market; and\nThe majority of the surveyed companies expressed their satisfaction with the training offerings in Malta; however, between 15% and 20% of the respondents indicated that more needs to be done with respect to the availability, quality and value for money of the training opportunities in Malta.\n\nThe survey which reflects responses received from 238 individual respondents (companies) looks at the size, nature and causes of unfilled vacancies, the recruitment strategies of the respondents, training and development activities as well as the educational offering to the online gaming industry in Malta.\n\nThe MGA’s Chief Officer of Finance & Programme Management, responsible for the Information & Research Unit, Peter Spiteri said:\n\n“We are pleased to publish the second paper on the Skill Gap Affecting the Online Gaming Industry with a view to shed light on the current state of play regarding human capital found on the island.\n\nRecent figures published by MGA through its Interim Performance Report indicate that 69% of employees in the online gaming sector are non-Maltese, highlighting the need for expatriate workers to sustain the ever-increasing demand of the industry.\n\nWhilst acknowledging that significant milestones have been achieved through the establishment of the European Gaming Institute of Malta as well as Gaming Malta’s Student Placement Programme initiative, the study indicates that there is significant potential for the local educational system to contribute in addressing the continuous thirst of the industry for a skilled workforce.”\n\nA full copy of the survey can be downloaded from here."

The topics included research in responsible gambling communications with at-risk consumers, suicide awareness and prevention training, and the provision of responsible gambling staff training.\n\nOn the final day of the Responsible Gambling Week, licensees were invited to air their views and share their respective experiences on several topical issues within the responsible gaming sphere, such as self-exclusion, responsible game design, and their experience with researchers. The MGA supported this initiative by hosting this final session of the Week at its premises.\n\nThe MGA’s Senior Counsel for Legal, International Affairs and Policy, Yanica Sant, noted that: “We are very pleased to see the industry take the initiative to share best practices with the aim of collectively improving the protection granted to players. The MGA acknowledges that it must work together with the industry in order to continue developing an increasingly safe environment for players. The ideas gathered from this final session will be reflected in our responsible gaming and player protection strategy for the coming years.”"

    "html": "NEWS\n20 December 2019\nThe MGA Publishes its Interim Performance Report for the Gaming Industry for the Period January to June 2019\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) has published its interim performance report for the period between January to June 2019. The report reviews the performance of the MGA, highlighting major projects undertaken and key achievements throughout the same period. The report also includes a section highlighting the key performance indicators for the first half of 2019 as well as a medium-term outlook into the future, followed by a detailed report explaining key statistics for land-based and online gaming sectors.\n\nThe following are the key highlights from the Interim Report:\n\nDuring the period under review, the Authority deepened its Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Funding of Terrorism efforts through intelligence gathering and knowledge-sharing with relevant authorities;\nThe MGA’s Fit & Proper Committee held 19 meetings throughout the first six months of 2019 with a total of 107 decisions taken. The Committee issued a total of 13 refusals, six at onboarding and seven through ongoing monitoring, on the basis that either the company itself or the individuals connected to it were not deemed fit and proper. Furthermore, the Committee issued 48 conditional verdicts whereby further information and/or documentation was required to proceed with the final decision;\nBetween January and June 2019, following information which emerged from compliance audits, compliance reviews, and formal investigations, the Authority issued 11 Notices of Reprimand, suspended 11 licences and cancelled another seven. In addition, the MGA issued a total of eight administrative fines;\nThe Authority entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Malta Police Force to further increase and improve the efficacy of their co-operation and exchange of information;\nIn order to strengthen its relationship with its international counterparts, the MGA has hosted several delegations from Ireland, Lagos and Ghana, with the aim of sharing information and increasing co-operation with such authorities;\nDuring the first six months of 2019, the MGA signed an MoU with the Swedish Gambling Authority in order to facilitate on-going communications between the authorities, and to support the effective sharing of information on matters of mutual interest and policy areas;\nThe Authority has received 23 international co-operation requests and has sent 33 of such requests. These covered various areas, including sports integrity, criminal activity by players, adverse media reports, locally licensed operators and entities not holding a licence as well as the Authority’s authorisation process and the regulatory regime;\nDuring the period under review, a total of 597 criminal probity screening tests were carried out covering both land-based and remote gaming activities;\nBetween January and June 2019, the Player Support Unit received a total of 1,753 requests for assistance and resolved 1,915 queries (with the latter covering some requests which were still pending at the end of 2018). Furthermore, the Unit took on an additional role in examining the monthly Alternative Dispute Resolution reports submitted by the operators;\nThe gaming industry contributed around 13.6% of the total value added of the Maltese economy during the first half of 2019;\nThe number of companies licensed by the MGA, including both online and land-based entities, stood at 283 as at the end of June 2019; and\nBy June 2019, the gaming industry was directly generating 7,011 full-time equivalent jobs (6,794 as at the end of December 2018) with 6,142 employees working in the online gaming industry (5,950 as at the end of December 2018) and additional 869 in the land-based sector (844 as at the end of December 2018).\n\nIn publishing this report, Peter Spiteri, Chief Officer Finance & Programme Management of the Authority, stated that: “During the first six months of 2019, the MGA continued with the implementation of the Gaming Act for the land-based industry that became subject to the new law from 1 January 2019. A lot has been done by the Authority to ensure that the implementation was completed effectively and all systems and procedures cater to the new requirements.\n\nDuring the past months, the MGA has increased the co-operation efforts with the international counterparts, relevant authorities and other regulatory bodies to further improve the efficacy of co-operation and exchange of information for better regulation.\n\nDespite various challenges facing the sector over the past years, the gaming sector continues to consolidate its standing within the Maltese economy. The MGA strives to ensure that the industry in Malta remains compliant with an evolving set of regulations that cater for newly emerging risks and maintains a strong reputation.”\n\nThe MGA will publish a full-year industry performance report in June 2020 when it publishes its Annual Report for the financial year ending 31 December 2019.\n\nThe 2019 Interim Performance Report may be accessed here."

    "html": "NEWS\n10 August 2016\nSkill Games – Fantasy Sports in focus\n\nIn December 2015, the Malta Gaming Authority (the ‘Authority’) published its Position Paper on Digital Games of Skill with Prize following a public consultation.\n\nThe Authority stated that in view of the element of skill and knowledge involved in fantasy sports, such an activity should be differentiated from games of chance in terms of licensing and regulation. This relates specifically to fantasy sports where players choose virtual representations of real-life athletes, where the value and points attributed to an athlete reflect the athletes’ performance in actual sporting events, and where the outcome is determined predominantly by skill and knowledge rather than by chance. The Authority also took the position that such games still warrant regulatory intervention which is appropriate and proportionate to address the level of risk presented to the consumer.\n\nThe Maltese Government is committed to introduce legislation to regulate certain skill games which may present increased risks to the consumer. In this regard, the proposed Skill Games Regulations have been notified to the European Commission as part of the process for the Authority to roll out its licensing framework to regulate such skill-based games, including fantasy sports.\n\nIn the interim, the Minister for Competitiveness and Digital, Maritime and Services Economy, the Hon. Dr Emmanuel Mallia, has, on advice of the Authority, published the attached Legal Notice 271 of 2016, entitled the Fantasy Sports (Exemption) Regulations (S.L. 438.10), exempting fantasy sports from the requirement of a gambling licence issued in terms of the Lotteries and Other Games Act (Chapter 438 of the Laws of Malta) or the Remote Gaming Regulations (S.L. 438.04).\n\nIn effect, during this temporary period and until the proposed regulatory framework for skill games is put into force, the Authority shall be open to receiving interests via ad hoc notifications, in order to closely monitor these operations and evaluate potential risks to the consumer.\n\nEntities offering fantasy sports may voluntarily notify their operations to the Authority via the form provided through the following link, and subject to meeting certain general conditions applicable under general law, the operator will be formally recognised by the Authority.\n\nInterested operators are kindly invited to send any queries to skillgames.mga@mga.org.mt so that they can be guided accordingly."

Discussions around these topics and exchange of best practices between both regulators ensued.\n\nThe MGA is constantly welcoming such opportunities to meet counterpart gambling regulators, as they are the ideal platform for knowledge sharing and cooperation."

The original consultation document may be accessed on the MGA’s website through the following link.\n\nThe general aim of the proposed Code is the protection of minors and other individuals who are, or may be more susceptible to problem gambling, the promotion and safeguarding of players’ rights and responsible gaming, the elimination of misleading terms, and in general the fair and non-predatory treatment of consumers by gaming operators.\n\nThe consultation on the draft Code of Commercial Communications is part of a series of consultations which the MGA is currently conducting with a view to advising it on the best approaches to be adopted in the regulatory overhaul which it is currently working on. The feedback provided on this consultation will now be considered in the finalisation of the text of the Code as well as, where relevant, in the drafting of the rest of the legislative initiatives required to complete the new gaming framework."

    "html": "NEWS\n16 May 2016\nAmendments to the Remote Gaming Regulations and Publication of the Return to Player Directive\n\nOn the 22nd of April 2016, the Remote Gaming Regulations (S.L. 438.04) were amended through the publication of Legal Notice 131 of 2016. The amendment introduces new obligations on entities licensed in terms of the Remote Gaming Regulations.\n\nThe new regulation 46A requires that specified casino-type games offered under a remote gaming licence issued by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) shall abide by a minimum average return to player (RTP) of 92% or any such higher percentage as may be stipulated through the licence condition.\n\nIn order to further clarify the requirements established by regulation 46A, the Authority is also publishing the Return to Player Directive (Directive 1 of 2016). This Directive specifies the games for which the minimum average return to player obligation is applicable, as well as the methodology which the MGA may use to ensure compliance with such a requirement, for instance periodic checks, and / or certification.\n\nFurthermore the new regulation 49A requires licensees to make available to the players, information related to any fees charged to the players as well as the average winnings paid out to players over a period of time. The intention of these provisions is to enhance the consumer protection measures afforded by the Remote Gaming Regulations, specifically in terms of transparency and fairness of the games.\n\nLegal Notice 131 of 2016 also introduces the new Part XVIII on the power of the MGA to implement a monitoring system. The enactment of this new section follows the public consultation and stakeholder interaction which the MGA carried out in the previous months relating to an Enhanced Automated Reporting Platform (EARP) for Remote Gaming. The intention behind the implementation of such a platform is to, amongst other things, streamline, automate and enhance certain reporting and compliance processes, reduce complexities in investigations, and strengthen the regulatory framework. The new regulations 61 to 63 empower the MGA to operate such a platform and to connect it to the licensees’ systems, and also set out the parameters for which such a platform may be used. The stakeholder feedback received will be taken into consideration when such a system is implemented."

The MGA is keen to receive input from everyone, but particularly from the latter two of the stakeholder groups.\n\nThe MGA considers the proposals made by the JWG and being here presented to you for consultation and input to be work in progress. The Authority will consider all input. It is guided by its aim at being transparent in policy decision-making and to be a more effective regulator while allowing the industry to flourish without compromising its core values and principles of preventing crime and protecting consumers in the gaming sphere under its governance. The MGA considered the proposals made by the JWG to attain that balance.\n\nThe MGA is inviting all interested parties to take part in this process and share their insight and comments with the MGA by replying to the specific questions being presented in the consultation document and by submitting any other relevant comments they may have on the subject matter.  Queries and requests for clarifications with respect to the content of the document, as well as contributions/feedback from interested parties may be sent to consultations.mga@mga.org.mt\n\nClosing date for feedback on the aforementioned consultation is Monday, 1 August, 2016."

The theme of the 2015 Annual Report is Regulation for Innovation: Re-thinking conventional wisdom.\n\nThe MGA is the single governing body for the regulation of the gaming industry in Malta.  During 2015, the gaming sector in Malta continued to experience healthy growth in both the land-based and remote gaming sectors. The following are key highlights from the Annual Report:\n\nDuring the year under review, the MGA generated a total revenue of €60.9m compared to €58.4m in 2014. This represents an increase of €2.5m or a 4.3% increase year on year. Furthermore, contributions in gaming taxes made to Government in 2015 amounted to €55.8m compared to €53.2m in 2014. This represents an increase of €2.6m or a 4.9% increase year on year. The sector also made a direct contribution of 8.2% to Malta’s Gross Value Added in the economy,\nThe land-based gaming sector grew by 3% year on year with total gross gaming revenue reaching €78.1m. Amounts played in the land-based sector reached a total of €333.1m with total winnings amounting to €255m,\nThe Authority continued to focus its efforts on the overhaul of the current legislation. The new legislation will provide an innovative regulatory framework which is robust and flexible enough to provide for effective regulatory oversight and at the same time facilitate industry growth and evolution,\nThe regulatory oversight function was also strengthened through the setting up of a Supervisory Council with the responsibility for the integrity, consistency and ongoing development of the Authority’s regulatory performance,\nThe GamingMalta Foundation was set up with the aim of promoting Malta both locally and internationally as a leading jurisdiction and centre of excellence in the gaming industry,\nThe Authority also focused on improving the efficacy of its operations through a right sizing exercise including the implementation of a robust ICT infrastructure and advanced information systems designed to facilitate processes, enhance the quality of its interface with licensees, improve information security and the optimisation of resource utilisation,\nThe Authority’s corporate identity was completely refreshed to signal a new vision for the industry through the rebranding of the ‘Lotteries and Gaming Authority’ to the ‘Malta Gaming Authority’. The Authority also relocated to new offices at SmartCity Malta.\n\n“2015 has been a very intensive and rewarding year on many fronts for the MGA. The results strengthen our determination to continue with our plans to enhance our regulatory performance. The aim of the three-year strategy launched in 2014 is to create a sustainable industry base in the face of the challenges emanating from the European and global gaming sphere, as well as harnessing the growth of the sector through the diversification of markets and products made possible by innovative technologies and emerging markets,” stated the MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri. “An increased focus on quality, innovation, fairness, consumer protection, proportionality, evidence-based regulation and consistency run through the building blocks of the Authority, its processes and the policy initiatives being taken up, are an integral part of the underlying strategy”, continued Mr Cuschieri.\n\nThe MGA’s 2015 annual report provides a detailed overview of the salient developments during the year under review. Throughout the year, the Authority’s efforts were committed to a fully inclusive and transparent approach in the reviewing and design of policy and administrative initiatives, whilst keeping an open dialogue with all stakeholders, consumers, regulators, operators and service providers. The regulatory framework overhaul is critical for the successful implementation of the gaming repositioning strategy in rendering Malta as a centre of excellence of global relevance in the future.\n\nAlthough Malta’s second generation of gaming regulation remains founded on the prevention of crime and fraud, fairness of games, consumer protection and other vulnerable consumers, the legislative structure and regulatory approaches proposed for adoption in 2016, will provide a coherent governing regime that is principle-based, focused on regulatory performance and outcomes.\n\nThe 2015 Annual Report may be downloaded from here or a copy may be requested from the Authority."

Prime Minister, Dr Joseph Muscat and Parliamentary Secretary for Competitiveness and Economic Growth, Dr Jose’ Herrera\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority’s (MGA) new offices, at SmartCity Malta were officially inaugurated on 16 February, 2016 by the Prime Minister of Malta, Dr Joseph Muscat, the MGA’s Senior Leadership Team and other distinguished guests.\n\nWith a floor area spanning over 2,562 square metres spread on two floors, the new MGA offices meet the latest environmental standards, technological infrastructure, corporate environment and modern facilities which have substantially improved the working environment for the 150 employees. Furthermore, the new offices incorporate all the facilities needed for the Authority to carry out its functions and activities in-house being press events, networking events, seminars and training for staff. The open plan and “hot desking” environment also caters for future growth.\n\nIn his opening address, Joseph Cuschieri, the MGA’s Executive Chairman, highlighted the milestones that have contributed to the success of the gaming authority since its inception in 2004. Mr Cuschieri mentioned the fact that Malta was the first EU Member State to enact comprehensive legislation on remote gaming. He added that industry stakeholders consider Malta as a thought leader and one of the foremost tried and tested jurisdictions in the world.  He then extended his heartfelt thanks to the MGA’s employees and all those who lent their support to the success story of the Malta Gaming Authority. Mr Cuschieri mentioned that the most important project of the MGA this year is the new Gaming Act which is expected to be presented in Parliament before the summer recess.  The Executive Chairman announced that the new legislation will be a game changer for Malta and will future proof Malta’s status as a jurisdiction of excellence. Some of the changes include new consumer protection measures as well as the simplification in the licensing structure from the current model to a Business to Business (B2B) and Business to Consumer (B2C) framework. This will eliminate duplication of checks and speed up time to market for the operators.\n\nFrom Left to Right – MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri and Hon. Prime Minister, Dr Joseph Muscat\n\nSpeaking at the inauguration, Parliamentary Secretary for Competitiveness and Economic Growth, Dr Jose’ Herrera, praised the MGA for another milestone in its success story. “The new offices are equipped with the latest technology so that the Authority will be able to continue to deliver positive results as reflected in the interim performance report published just a few weeks ago. The gaming industry contributes substantially to Malta’s GDP and it is in our interest to sustain this sector.”\n\nIn his closing address, the Hon. Prime Minister, Dr Joseph Muscat, praised the MGA for having put in place a strategy that emphasises innovation and diversity in order to continue attracting investors to Malta. Dr Muscat concluded by applauding the role of a transparent and business friendly Authority which is continually reviewing its processes in order to be better equipped to deal with the ever-changing environment that surrounds this dynamic sector.\n\nThe opening ceremony ended with a guided tour of the premises."

    "html": "NEWS\n11 March 2016\nMGA publishes Consultation Feedback on the adoption of Enhanced Automated Reporting Platforms (EARP) to enhance regulatory compliance & reporting\n\nFollowing a public consultation process on the adoption of an enhanced reporting tool for Land Based Gaming Devices and the Remote Gaming Sector through the implementation of an enhanced automated reporting platform (EARP), the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) is publishing a summary of the consultation feedback highlighting key points raised through the consultation process. The original consultation document may be accessed on the MGA’s website through the following link.\n\nThe purpose of the Consultation feedback (available below) for both Land-based and Online EARP is to assist the MGA in establishing its official position and recommended way forward for the EARP initiative. It is pertinent to point out that the main objective of the implementation of EARP systems is to improve reporting efficiency and minimise regulatory burdens and costs on the industry but at the same time ensure the availability of the required data by the Authority.\n\nThe MGA is of the view that the implementation of an EARP will not be disruptive to the operator, and the objective is for the benefits to outweigh any potential effort and cost to implement. Whilst recognising the success which the industry enjoys today, the MGA needs to increase its focus on future stability, integrity, sustainability and compliance. Through the consultation feedback received, it is clear that the suggested improvements to the current reporting framework are being welcomed by the industry in that it will provide value towards sustainability, growth and stability for Malta as a jurisdiction as well as for player protection."

    "html": "NEWS\n29 January 2016\nMGA publishes a Public Consultation Paper on a Code of Commercial Communications\n\nMarketing and advertising are a critical part of any gaming service. Consumers are faced with a wide array of options in terms of operators and games across different mediums. Players can choose anything from slot machines in one of the casinos, online sports-betting to a traditional bingo. Attracting consumers is an important consideration for gaming operators, whether it is through traditional or digital means of advertising, or via inducements and bonuses. In light of this, the proper regulation of advertising of gaming services is of paramount importance.\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) is of the view that the current rules on the advertising of gaming services need to be updated to better reflect the sector’s development, in terms of player behaviour, marketing techniques, new technologies, regulatory practice, and the needs of society in general. To this effect, the Authority is hereby publishing the draft Code of Commercial Communications for public consultation and feedback.\n\nThe general aim of the proposed Code is the protection of minors and other individuals who are, or may be more susceptible to problem gambling, the promotion and safeguarding of players’ rights and responsible gaming, the elimination of misleading terms, and in general the fair and non-predatory treatment of consumers by gaming operators.\n\nQueries and requests for clarifications with respect to the content of the document, as well as contributions/feedback from interested parties may be sent to consultations.mga@mga.org.mt\n\nClosing date for feedback on the aforementioned consultation is Monday, 28 March 2016."

Furthermore, a high degree of interest was registered by potential new licensees in establishing their presence in Malta to serve markets in Europe and beyond. The new gaming legislation which should be enacted later this year and the changing regulatory landscape in Europe was of particular interest to the industry. “This is very encouraging for both Malta and the MGA”, said Mr. Cuschieri. “It gives us the motivation and resolve to continue delivering on our strategic plans to make Malta the Silicon Valley of gaming and a global centre of excellence”, he continued.\n\nAt this year’s expo, the MGA participated with a team of 12 officials with disciplines ranging from Legal, International Affairs, Compliance and Authorisations together with members of the MGA’s senior leadership team."

In consolidating perspectives of interested parties through public consultation, the Authority is better placed to implement effective and efficient regulatory processes around suspicious betting in the sports betting sector.\n\nIn addition, the Authority is also interested in initiating a dialogue with B2B licensees to consider what their contribution towards sports integrity can look like in terms of detection and exchange of information with either B2C licensees, or the Authority itself. Furthermore, the document underlines other areas of interest which the Sports Integrity Unit shall be looking into in the near future.\n\nQueries, requests for clarification, as well as contributions or feedback from interested parties on the “Consultation Paper on the Suspicious Betting Reporting Requirements & Other Sports Integrity Matters”, are to be sent via email, here.\n\nClosing date for any related submissions is Wednesday, 15 July 2020."

In addition, the report also includes a summary of the performance of the Maltese gaming industry during 2019 and an outlook for the medium-term future.\n\nThe following are the key highlights from the Annual Report covering the year 2019:\n\nThe Authority cancelled 14 licences and suspended 11. In addition, it issued 20 warnings, 89 Notices of Breach and 23 administrative fines imposed on operators following various regulatory breaches;\n89 applications for a gaming licence were received in 2019; 44 applications were either rejected or withdrawn and 53 licences were issued during the period under review, including licences the application for which had been received during the previous year;\n15 individuals and companies were deemed not to be up to the Authority’s probity standards by the Fit & Proper Committee, mainly on the basis of mitigating the risks of money laundering or funding of terrorism;\n48 audits were conducted by the Compliance and AML function;\n69 international cooperation requests were sent by the MGA in 2019, predominantly as part of the criminal probity assessments, with the Authority receiving 58 international co-operation requests;\n1,300 criminal probity screening assessments were carried out in 2019;\nThe Authority revised its Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit, and also signed an MOU with the Malta Police Force, aimed at strengthening the fight again corruption and money laundering;\nAs at the end of December 2019, the number of companies licensed by the MGA, including both online and land-based entities, stood at 294.\n\nIn publishing this report, Heathcliff Farrugia, Chief Executive Officer of the Malta Gaming Authority, stated that: “Overall, 2019 was a very challenging but at the same time rewarding year for the MGA. The increased focus on compliance and enforcement which was prevalent throughout the year has yielded tangible results for the Authority.\n\nThis focus led to internal restructuring for the better achievement of the MGA’s objectives, and was also pivotal in the Authority’s drive towards the setting up of the Sports Integrity Unit, tasked with increasing the commitment towards the fight against the manipulation of sports competitions. In its first months, this unit has already signed important collaboration agreements with international sport bodies in order to tackle betting-related corruption and ensure the integrity of sports.\n\nSuch collaboration, both at a local and international level was high on the agenda in 2019, and will continue being crucial in 2020, as a key determining factor in the ongoing fight against crime, corruption and money laundering.”"

These MoU’s are a solid basis to share knowledge, to cooperate, and to smoothly exchange information. At the same time operators will be receiving a clear signal that hands of regulators will be joined internationally.”\n\nThe MGA’s Chief Executive Officer, Heathcliff Farrugia, expressed his satisfaction on this agreement whereby he stated that: “This MoU with the Dutch Gambling Authority is another step in the right direction, and follows other similar MoU’s which the MGA signed with other regulators over the past years.  Our relationship and cooperation with Kansspelautoriteit has already yielded tangible results in the past, and with this MoU, apart from formalising such relationship, a stronger collaboration at an international level is also ensured.”"

The representatives present then proceeded to signing the cooperation arrangement as a sign of endorsement. Dr Edwina Licari, Chief Officer – Legal & EU/International Affairs represented the MGA on the panel and signed the agreement on Malta’s behalf.\n\nThe MGA’s Executive Chairman Joseph Cuschieri welcomed today’s signing of the administrative cooperation arrangement (see link) with other EU/EEA gambling authorities during today’s special meeting held in Brussels and augurs that this shall be a stepping stone towards constructive information sharing, alignment and embracing of innovation while adopting a best practice approach towards regulation. “This agreement is a result of various discussions and debates between the various national gaming authorities and credit goes to the officials working in DG-GROW as well as to the representative officials of the various regulatory bodies who collectively worked towards this significant multilateral achievement.”\n\nThis agreement aims to institutionalise and structure the ongoing cooperation between the competent authorities of EU/EEA member states relating to the exchange of information and best practices, as well as to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens in gaming related matters. The MGA believes that in order to achieve results, clear objectives need to be set in order to keep up with this dynamic and fast moving industry. The MGA hopes that such an agreement would facilitate communication in order to embrace the subject of online gambling services objectively, as a regulated offer irrespective of the country of consumption or supply. The message transmitted through such cooperation and the value that may ensue is the link between independent authorities all working towards the same objectives within the respective political and governmental ambits albeit diverse legal and regulatory gaming frameworks.\n\nFor further information, see below:\n\nTowards a comprehensive European framework for online gambling\nExpert group on gambling services"

    "html": "NEWS\n7 December 2015\nMGA issues Position Paper on Digital Games of Skill with Prize\n\nFollowing a public consultation process and an assessment of the feedback received, the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) is publishing its position with respect to digital games of skill with prize offered through means of distance communication. The consultation document and feedback received can be accessed on the MGA’s website through the following link.\n\nThe position paper, (which can be accessed below), seeks to clarify the Authority’s stand and approach with respect to the several different types of games available on the market which may include elements of skill, as well as detailing the Authority’s regulatory policy into the proposed overhaul of gaming legislation in Malta.\n\nWith respect to the regulatory policy concerning skill games in the short and medium term, and within the context of the regulatory overhaul underway, the Authority is of the opinion that skill games (with prize) with no, or a negligible element of chance should not be subjected to licensing requirements, since the risks associated with these games do not warrant such stringent ex-ante requirements. However, skill game operators and their gaming activities should fall under the governance and regulatory competence of the Authority and be subject to certain standards and monitoring to ensure a safe and fair environment for consumers. On the other hand, for games the outcome of which is mainly accidental but also influenced significantly by the skill of the player, and which are licensable under the present gaming framework, are also identified. The position is that such games should still be subject to a licensing requirement, but the requirements imposed should reflect the risk posed by such operation, and as such must be distinguished from those of games of chance. Regulatory intervention should not go beyond what is necessary to ensure a safe and fair environment for consumers, free from criminal activity.\n\nThe Authority therefore considers that the new regulatory framework should reflect the principles set out in this position paper, and will make proposals to this effect to Government. The Authority shall continue to monitor developments in this gaming segment and will review its position as necessary in the future."

Herrera acknowledged the excellent work which the Malta Gaming Authority is doing in this regard, whilst also praised the Responsible Gaming Foundation for its involvement to promote responsible use of gaming. Nevertheless, Hon. Herrera added that one has to cater also for those individuals who are unable to perceive gambling as a recreational activity because of their loss of control. In fact, the main aim of the Helpline 1777 is to help individuals and their families who are experiencing any problems related to problematic gambling/dependency.\n\nThe Parliamentary Secretary added that professional help is necessary when the gambler’s main priorities in life revolve around gambling activities only. Indeed, the main aim of the Helpline 1777 is to support these individuals and their families in their afflictions and other life difficulties that may arise from this behavioural dependency.  Till the present date, there is no statistics which can shed light on the extent of such a problem.  “Statistics from MGA only indicates that in 2014, the rate of people who made use of the self-barring service increased to 1,043 persons when compared to the 970 individuals in 2013.”\n\nThe chairperson of the RGF, Hon. Silvio Schembri stated that gaming is a well-integrated concept in our Maltese culture and greater effort should be made in educating our citizens to pursuit gambling for recreational purposes only.  Yet, once a person forms a dependency, the individual can never become a responsible gambler.  “The Foundation is operating this Helpline as in Malta as to date there is not yet a helpline which specifically supports this vulnerable group in need of support and guidance.”  Hon. Silvio Schembri emphasised that the Helpline 1777 will also support the gambler’s family members and significant others as they too experience various negative repercussions. MP. Silvio Schembri underlined the fact that this is a social problem and that it is our responsibility to help these people instead of   “ignoring or excluding them.”\n\nMs. Lorraine Mifsud, Call Centre Manager explained in further details the aims of this innovative service. She described gambling dependency as a disease “which brings along other life difficulties such as mental health problems, psychological, physical and also social problems.” In the near future, Helpline 1777 will also be available 24/7 for the general public to assist them in their difficulties."

The underlying objective is to continue steering Malta to be the absolute leader, fostering innovation, development and thought leadership in distinct areas of the sector’s governance.  These areas include the overall integrity of the sector, enhanced player protection and regulatory compliance performance.\n\nThe MGA’s objective is to consult publicly on issues which are industry relevant and have a potential impact on operators. As such, the MGA wishes to involve all potentially impacted stakeholders in its consultation processes to obtain their views and perspectives on the possible impact of changes in technology and/or operational requirements for enhanced compliance reporting.\n\nIn this regard, the MGA is looking into the adoption of enhanced reporting tool for Land Based Gaming Devices, primarily through the means of the implementation of an automated enhanced reporting platform. The MGA’s aim is to continue to improve on compliance reporting, leveraging technology to further drive benefits to the industry in general and the operators in particular, in order to reach its goals of improved future stability, integrity and consumer protection. The Consultation on Enhanced Automated Reporting Platform (EARP) for Land Based Gaming Devices in Casinos and Gaming Parlours can be viewed here.\n\nFurthermore, the MGA is evaluating the adoption of an Enhanced Automated Reporting Platform for the remote gaming sector. This is due to the fact that some operators are choosing to locate part of their technical infrastructure in locations other than Malta which may hinder the timely and effective reporting capability by the MGA. The Consultation on Enhanced Automated Reporting Platform for Online / Remote Gaming can be accessed through here.\n\nQueries and requests for clarifications with respect to the contents of both aforementioned documents, as well as contributions/feedback from interested parties may be sent to consultations.mga@mga.org.mt\n\nClosing date for both consultations is Wednesday, 16 December 2015 at 16:00h."

The Committee issued a total of five refusals of individuals and companies, due to them being assessed as not fit and proper on the basis of mitigating the risks of ML/TF. Furthermore, the Committee issued 35 conditional verdicts whereby further information and/or documentation was required to proceed with the final decision. The remaining decisions taken during the first six months of 2020 were pertinent to procedural matters in light of the limitations imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\nDuring the period under review, a Consultation Paper on Suspicious Betting Reporting Requirements & Other Sports Integrity Measures was published in preparation for the implementation of the Suspicious Betting Reporting Requirements which will oblige Business-to-Consumer licensees offering betting on sporting events to inform the Authority of any instance of suspicious betting;\nRecognising the importance of establishing data-sharing agreements with relevant stakeholders, including sport governing bodies and other platforms whose function includes the detection of suspicious betting activities, the MGA signed a total of four agreements, namely a data-sharing agreement with the International Cricket Council, the Swedish Football Association, the Darts Regulation Authority and the World Professional Billiards & Snooker Association;\nBetween January and June 2020, the Commercial Communication Committee of the MGA has taken action against 10 adverts or promotions that, in the opinion of the Committee, inappropriately exploited the COVID-19 pandemic;\nBetween January and June 2020, following information which emerged from compliance audits, compliance reviews, and formal investigations, the Authority issued 11 warnings, suspended two licences, and cancelled another seven. In addition, the MGA issued a total of nine administrative fines;\nThe Authority has received 40 international co-operation requests and has sent 25 such requests. These covered various areas, including sports integrity, criminal activity by players, adverse media reports, locally licensed operators and entities not holding a licence, as well as the Authority’s authorisation process and the regulatory regime;\nIn order to facilitate the on-going close communication between authorities and the effective sharing of information, the Authority entered into an MoU with the Malta Business Registry;\nIn its efforts to boost knowledge sharing and co-operation with international counterparts, the MGA has hosted a delegation of members of the Lotteries and Gaming Board and the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage of the Republic of Zimbabwe;\nDuring the period under review, a total of 833 criminal probity screening tests were carried out, covering both land-based and remote gaming activities; and\nDuring the first six months of 2020 the Player Support Unit received a total of 2,431 requests for assistance and resolved 2,433 queries (with the latter covering some requests which were still pending at the end of 2019). The COVID-19 pandemic has affected players differently and as a result a 38% increase year-on-year was registered in the number of requests received during this period.\n\nThe MGA will publish a full-year industry performance report in May 2021 when it publishes its Annual Report for the financial year ending 31 December 2020.\n\n "

    "html": "NEWS\n4 September 2015\nThe MGA publishes a Concept Paper relating to Outsourcing in Remote Gaming\n\nAs the remote gaming industry continues to develop, grow and venture into new markets, it is increasingly relying on outsourcing. Notwithstanding the fact that the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) has long accepted this practice and intends to continue upholding it, it deems a policy on the subject matter is necessary.\n\nFor this reason, the MGA wishes to develop a draft policy in conjunction with the gaming industry for which a Joint Working Group is being set up with members representing the widest possible spectrum of the industry. The aim is to generally introduce the concept as well as the perspective of the MGA on outsourcing in remote gaming. It seeks to set out a number of parameters for a Policy on Outsourcing which the MGA would like to develop and adopt in collaboration with the industry.\n\nThe proposed Joint Working Group shall be composed of 10 members: four (4) from the MGA and six (6) members representing the remote gaming industry. The Group shall elect its Chairperson from amongst its members. Members of the working group may invite senior industry officials or their representative bodies, or other regulator/s, with knowledge/experience in the sector and subject matter being discussed, including stakeholders’ representatives of service providers of outsourced activities. The Working Group may receive such representations and input from other stakeholders in person (through participation/presentation in meetings) or in writing.\n\nThe Joint Working Group will be launched once the nominations are made by the industry (during September 2015) and will remain operational for a period of 12 weeks, by which time it is expected that the Working Group would have adopted a common position on a proposal for a Policy on Outsourcing, with input from other relevant stakeholders. Meetings shall be held physically or using secure teleconference facilities.\n\nFor more information, please send an email to consultations.mga@mga.org.mt."

    "html": "NEWS\n3 September 2015\nThe MGA publishes its “Fit and Proper” guidelines and a consultation on the Key Official fitness and propriety requirements\n\nMalta is in the process of overhauling its regulatory framework governing the gaming sector in order to future proof the industry and align it to new realities and challenges. A wide range of policies are being critically reviewed to amongst other things, continuously raise standards of governance and reinforce the supervisory and compliance monitoring of the industry by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA).\n\nThe MGA’s fit and proper guidelines are one of a series of measures to be launched by the MGA in order to ensure a consistent and transparent approach in its regulatory outreach in the interests of all stakeholders and customers alike.\n\nThese Guidelines set out the minimum criteria applicable to all relevant persons falling under all the activities regulated by the MGA in accordance with applicable law. The MGA’s vision is to ensure that it facilitates effective compliance, reduce administrative burdens and duplication of requirements on the industry without compromising its regulatory ethos. A revamped set of application and reporting guidelines together with updated official application forms shall also be issued in the coming weeks together with other regulatory “quick win” announcements forming part of the MGA’s intensive transformation process referred to in the recently published annual report for 2014.\n\nThe MGA has recognised the necessity to strengthen the requirements which must be met by the person fulfilling the Key Official function. In doing so, the MGA aims to strengthen the compliance capability of the licensee which has become a more critical feature of the MGA’s fit and proper assessment. The Authority’s objective in this area is generally to ensure that an operator has sufficient compliance capability and competence allocated to the right official/s who will in turn enhance the systemic compliance performance of its licensees.\n\nWhile the governance and risk management review and the fit and proper assessment policy framework address all forms of gaming operations and licensees, including land-based, this consultation deals only with the Key Official function of remote gaming operations. Notwithstanding the specificity of this consultation, the MGA is envisaging the adoption of similar requirements for key officials for land-based licensees.\n\nThe Fit and Proper Guidelines can be accessed here, whereas the Consultation on the Key Official fitness and propriety requirements can be viewed here.\n\nAll responses should be sent by email to consultations.mga@mga.org.mt by not later than Friday 16 October 2015.\n\nAlternatively, responses can be sent by post to:\n\nConsultations\nMalta Gaming Authority\nSuite 1, Level 3, TG Complex,\nBrewery Street Mriehel,\nBKR 3000,\nMalta"

We are therefore pleased to have been awarded a Class II Remote Gaming licence by the MGA, following a robust application process which examined our gambling operations, procedures and the experience of our personnel. In conjunction with the Maltese licensing process, we have also now established a Maltese marketing company, with premises located in Sliema, accommodating our marketing management and procurement functions headed by Mr Fred Bjurjfall who will be supporting the marketing activities of the Group”.\n\n“The Malta Gaming Authority is delighted to have bet365 included in its portfolio of licensees. The Authority is committed to addressing the ongoing evolution of the industry as well as the challenges this brings along with it, with transparency, integrity and focus on consumer protection. The fact that bet365 chose to include Malta as one of its licensing jurisdictions is testimony to our reputation and encourages us to keep raising the bar in innovation and thought leadership on gaming regulation” said Joseph Cuschieri, MGA’s Executive Chairman."

    "html": "NEWS\n5 July 2021\nThe MGA publishes its 2020 Annual Report and Financial Statements\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority (MGA/Authority) is publishing its Annual Report and audited Financial Statements for the financial year ending 31 December 2020. The report provides an overview of the work performed throughout the year and highlights major projects undertaken by the Authority throughout the same period. In addition, the report also outlines the performance of the Maltese gaming industry during 2020 as well as a medium-term outlook into the future, followed by a detailed report explaining key statistics for the land-based and online gaming sectors in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe following are the key highlights from the Annual Report covering the year 2020:\n\nBetween January and December 2020, following information which emerged from compliance audits, compliance reviews, and formal investigations, the Authority issued 69 warnings, suspended 3 licences, and cancelled another 12. In addition, the MGA issued a total of 24 administrative penalties.\nIn 2020, 30 compliance audits were conducted by the Compliance and AML function, one of which related to a live studio, and 324 desktop reviews were carried out, of which 98 identified deficiencies which were accordingly escalated to the Compliance and Enforcement Committee.\nIn 2020, 8 individuals and companies were deemed not to be up to the Authority’s probity standards by the Fit & Proper Committee, mainly on the basis of mitigating the risks of money laundering or funding of terrorism.\nDuring the twelve-month period of 2020, a total of 1,475 criminal probity screening checks were undertaken, an increase of 13.5% when compared to the year 2019.\nIn terms of AML/CFT, during the twelve-month period of 2020, a total of 27 supervisory examinations on online gaming licensees were conducted by the MGA, of which 10 were full scope examinations, 3 were targeted examinations, 8 were thematic examinations, and 6 were supervisory meetings.\nIn 2020, the MGA conducted a total of 65 interviews with prospective MLROs and key persons carrying out the AML/CFT function to determine the knowledge and suitability of each candidate, out of which 40 were approved, 17 were conditionally approved and 8 were rejected.\nThe Commercial Communication Committee of the MGA took action against 10 adverts or promotions that, in the opinion of the Committee, inappropriately exploited the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring 2020 the Player Support Unit received a total of 5,625 requests for assistance, a 58% increase over 2019, potentially stemming at least partly from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on player behaviour.\nIn its efforts to boost knowledge sharing and cooperation with international counterparts, the MGA hosted a delegation of members of the Lotteries and Gaming Board and the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage of the Republic of Zimbabwe.\nThe Authority received 67 international cooperation requests from other regulators and sent 47 such requests, with the majority referring to requests for background checks as part of an authorisation process.\nDuring the year 2020, a total of 168 requests for information specifically relating to the manipulation of sports competitions or breaches in sports rules were submitted by enforcement agencies, sport governing bodies, integrity units, and other regulatory bodies. Additionally, a total of 288 suspicious betting reports from licensees and other concerned parties were received.\nDuring the period under review, the Authority was a direct participant in 20 different investigations across the globe relating to manipulation of sports competitions or breaches in sports rules.\nRecognising the importance of establishing data sharing agreements with relevant stakeholders, including sport governing bodies and other platforms whose function includes the detection of suspicious betting activities, the MGA signed a total of five agreements, namely a data sharing agreement with the International Cricket Council, the Swedish Football Association, the Darts Regulation Authority, the World Professional Billiards & Snooker Association, and the Slovak Football Association.\nDuring 2020, the MGA and the FIAU signed an updated version of the MoU which brought forth better cooperative instruments for the supervision of AML/CFT in the gaming sector.\nThe Authority entered into an MoU with the Malta Business Registry with the aim of facilitating the ongoing close communication between authorities and the effective sharing of information.\nWith the aim of increasing cooperation with our international counterparts, an MoU was agreed to by the MGA and the Dutch Kansspelautoriteit (the Dutch Gambling Authority) on the basis that the two authorities will support each other by sharing best practices and information in support of their responsibilities at law, whilst also engaging in discussions on policy matters of interest.\nThe MGA also enhanced its collaboration with the Commissioner for Voluntary Organisations by creating a process whereby any entity that applies for a non-profit game is only issued with a permit if such an entity is a registered and compliant voluntary organisation.\nRecognising the importance of regular dialogue with stakeholders, throughout 2020, over 55 external communications were sent, providing a synopsis of various updates and developments within the Authority and industry.\n\nIn publishing this report, the CEO, Dr Carl Brincat said: “The year 2020 will undoubtedly be remembered for the challenges the pandemic presented us with, and I am proud of the Authority’s employees who worked tirelessly to ensure that we continued to perform the functions required of us at law. Keeping the ship steady during a challenging year serves as a strong foundation for us to look ahead with renewed commitment to keep building on the positives and improve on our shortcomings, to reach new heights in our regulatory approach.”"

    "html": "NEWS\n18 August 2015\nThe Council of Europe Convention on the manipulation of sports competitions\n\nPRESS RELEASE ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARIAT FOR COMPETITIVENESS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH \n\nMalta has requested the withdrawal of its Request For Opinion which it filed with the CJEU on the 8th of July 2014 in regard to the compatibility of the Council of Europe Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions with the EU Treaties, pursuant to Article 218(11) TFEU. The reason that Malta had submitted the Request for Opinion was to obtain an opinion on whether the definition of “illegal sports betting” was consistent with the objectives of the Treaty, including its scope.\n\nMalta’s position on the Convention has always been made very clear and remains unchanged. Malta has maintained that it fully supports the main objective of the Convention which is to prevent the manipulation of sports competitions. In fact, Malta is currently undergoing an exercise to ensure the implementation of stricter rules and systems to suppress fraud and manipulation in sports. However, Malta has consistently reiterated its concerns on the definition of ‘illegal sports betting’ which goes beyond the scope of the Convention and does not contribute to the fight against match fixing. Malta tabled various proposals for amendment throughout the discussions on the Convention and following the rejection of all such proposals, was compelled to vote against its adoption. Consequently, Malta did not sign the Convention when it was opened for signature in September 2014.\n\nNotwithstanding the submission of the Request for an Opinion in July 2014, a legislative proposal for the Union to proceed was proposed and is now being discussed in Council. Given the developing circumstances, and after examining the legislative proposal, Malta considers that other solutions may be available to it and has decided that, at this stage, it is more appropriate to try to achieve an acceptable state of affairs for Malta through deeper dialogue at the European level, without however renouncing to any of Malta’s rights and prerogatives. For these reasons, Malta will continue to hold discussions at the highest levels within the EU to safeguard this position during the following months.\n\nCredit – DOI – http://www.gov.mt/en/Government/Press%20Releases/Pages/2015/August/18/pr151852.aspx"

    "html": "NEWS\n30 June 2021\nThe Malta Gaming Authority signs sponsorship agreement with University of Malta\n\nEarlier today a sponsorship agreement was signed by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) and the University of Malta (UoM).\n\nThrough this sponsorship, the Department of Economics which forms part of the Faculty of Economics, Management and Accountancy organised a series of lectures on Game Theory which were delivered by visiting lecturer Professor Andrew Narwold from the University of San Diego. The agreement was signed by University of Malta Rector, Professor Alfred J. Vella and the Malta Gaming Authority’s Chief Executive Officer, Carl Brincat.\n\nUniversity of Malta Rector, Prof. Alfred J. Vella, welcomed this agreement, saying that knowledge of game theory will equip students with a much-needed skill, namely that of applying mathematical techniques to understanding behaviour and decisions that lead to particular outcomes, not always as intended.\n\n“We have here a very important example of how University training and specialist education facilitate the students’ journey towards their careers and personal success and also assists industry actors, and in this case, the regulator, in finding the human resources required for their development leading, ultimately, to  economic benefits for our society ”, he continued.\n\nThe MGA’s Chief Executive Officer, Carl Brincat stated that, “Promoting the development of Malta as a centre of excellence is among the MGA’s regulatory objectives and collaborating with the University of Malta on initiatives such as this is an invaluable step towards achieving it.”\n\nFurther to the sponsorship of these lectures through the provision of a Visiting Lecturer, the two entities have both committed themselves to more collaborations for the benefit of local students and the gaming industry."

    "html": "NEWS\n25 July 2015\nSuspension of Maltese Registered Online Gaming Licences in Relation to Italian Prosecution and Arrest Warrants\n\nFurther to media reports and actions taken by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) in relation to two Maltese registered online gaming companies based in Malta, it is pertinent to clarify a number of points which are important from a general public interest standpoint.\n\nThe two Maltese registered gaming companies who are the subject of the suspension and investigation are registered in Malta and have been operating in and from Malta since 2011 (Uniq Group Ltd) and since 2012 (Betsolutions4U Ltd). At the time of application (according to the MGA’s records), in line with standard procedures, all directors, shareholders, senior managers and ultimate beneficiary owners of these companies have been screened through MGA’s systems and protocols, using probity tools and national and international contacts and organisations. This forms part of the probity checks conducted at pre-licensing stage and before the actual business model of the gaming operation in question is screened and other control systems are checked and approved. The licensing process also includes independent audits, such as system and compliance audits which are carried out by approved external auditors.\n\nThe companies in question were registered with offices in Malta. They were licensed under the Remote Gaming Regulations to provide online betting and casino type games in and from Malta. According to their business model the online offer/services were distributed to players and facilitated through a number of online and land-based channels.\n\nIt is pertinent to point out that an MGA licence does not relieve the licensee from fulfilling their obligations under the licence irrespective of where the service is provided, or from any other regulatory requirements which may be applicable in the jurisdiction where the service is actually provided [such as the holding of a licence to operate betting shops]. In this particular case, it was the Italian authorities who took action and the Maltese authorities cooperated in full on the basis of the alleged money laundering.\n\nFurthermore, the Maltese authorities and the MGA are taking these money laundering allegations very seriously and are taking all necessary measures to protect the integrity of the Maltese jurisdiction and its gaming regulatory regime.\n\nREGULATORY ETHOS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nSome gaming activities, or rather, business models, may have a higher risk profile than others as much as certain individuals involved in an operation could carry higher risks and tarnish an otherwise legitimate operation. As an experienced online gaming regulator, it is our duty to minimise those risks as much as possible and put in place a detailed risk management policy to manage risk in every facet of the MGA’s activities. But as any regulator can vouch, it is unreasonable to expect that the legislation, mechanisms, protocols and control tools at hand provide for a 100% watertight controlled environment at any given time even though that remains our prime objective.\n\nBoth the legislation and our administrative systems and controls are constantly under review precisely in order to sharpen our processes to effectively mitigate new and emerging risks hence strengthening the hand of the regulator and enhance the control environment. This also involves investment in sophisticated technologies and business intelligence tools to enhance monitoring and compliance capabilities. Our focus remains on the enhancement of player protection and integrity of both games and the jurisdiction.\n\nReputational risk is critical for the long term sustainability of the gaming sector in Malta. This is ingrained in everything that we do. In delivering its functions and responsibilities, the MGA ensures that assessment of risk is led by evidence and best regulatory practice. Where there is no evidence, one takes a cautious approach. The MGA is responsible at law to ensure that gaming, in all its forms and through all channels, is fair and remains free from crime and fraud. In this respect, the MGA took immediate action to suspend the operations concerned.\n\nWhile the MGA considers these allegations as unique to these operators, the MGA will strongly enforce its rules and regulations to sustain its reputation and will aggressively bring in further measures to combat this type of licence violation.\n\nThe MGA’s player support service line is open to assist any players who are concerned about the status of their accounts. Player protection is our primary concern at the MGA and we will take all steps to assure that customers of Uniq Group Ltd and Betsolutions4U Ltd receive all their funds.\n\nFor more information please visit the MGA’s website at mgaorgmt.kinsta.cloud."

José Herrera, Parliamentary Secretary for Competitiveness and Economic Growth and Mr Joseph Cuschieri, Executive Chairman of the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) at the Mistral Suite and Terrace at the Marina Hotel Corinthia Beach resort.\n\nThe MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri\n\nThis year’s MiGs will be held at the Corinthia Hotel, St. Julian’s between the 16th and 19th of November.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of MiGS, Jeffrey Buttigieg, Director of MiGS and COO of RE/MAX Malta, thanked all attendees and collaborators for providing their support to the event. “Founded in 2008, today MiGs has become globally recognized as a must-attend conference on the iGaming Calendar.  Over the last two years, the event has seen a transformation and has matured into a top-ten event, as quoted by Calvinayre.com, a major iGaming online portal. Last year, the event was especially successful as we attracted over 450 delegates to MIGS14 and we started seeing the fruit of our labour during the previous five years,” Mr Buttigieg stated.\n\nOne of the highlights of the upcoming event in November – in line with the conference theme, “Past, Present and Future of iGaming” – will be hosting a panel that will include four remarkable pioneers of the industry that have a combined experience of over 100 years.  The event will also expound on a number of ensuing topics, including the latest EU directives, emerging jurisdictions, payments, advocacy as well as subjects of potential growth including Mobile gaming, eSports and others.\n\nMr Joseph Cuschieri, Executive Chairman of MGA, said that the Authority has supported MiGS from its humble beginnings, and congratulated the organisers for bringing together so many people for this launch.  He said that this proves that MiGS has a strong backing as he encouraged individuals to attend.\n\nHe added: “MiGS has not only played an important role in promoting the Malta Gaming industry over the years, but has also placed the country on the international gaming map, as a destination to attend a top level iGaming conference that attracts international executives.”\n\nHon. José Herrera, Parliamentary Secretary for Competitiveness and Economic Growth stated: “I am honoured to be able speak at the launch of such an entrepreneurial initiative from the private sector. The Malta iGaming Seminar is a must-attend event and I’d like to thank the organisers for doing Malta proud.”"

    "html": "NEWS\n12 June 2015\nMGA confirms its support to MIGS 2015\n\nThe Malta iGaming Seminar (MIGS) organising committee announced that the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) has confirmed its support for the 7th consecutive year. The conference will be held at the Corinthia Hotel, St. George’s Bay, between 16th and the 19th November.\n\nThe event has now become one of the most important events in the calendar of events of the gaming industry. Last year, the conference attracted over 400 delegates, 65% of whom travelled from mainland Europe, America, Asia and the Middle East. MIGS today is renowned for bringing together the best from the industry to contribute to the high profile discussions and presentations.\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority, which is the regulatory body responsible for the governance of all gaming activities in Malta, has been the main supporter of the conference from the very beginning since 2008. Speaking of their continued support, Joseph Cuschieri, Executive Chairman of the Malta Gaming Authority said, “MIGS has not only played an important role in promoting the Malta Gaming industry over the years but has also placed the country on the international  gaming map, as a destination to attend a top level iGaming conference that attracts international executives. We proudly look forward to supporting MIGS for yet another year, in Nov 2015.”\n\nMiGS 2015 promises to be one of the most informative and interactive conferences of its kind. The programme, which has already attracted several international high profile speakers, will keep those interested in this global industry abreast with international topics and latest trends.\n\nThe conference is also an ideal opportunity for executives to understand the potential of obtaining a gaming license in Malta, a credible jurisdiction better known as Europe’s iGaming Capital. Ms. Sue Schneider, Partner of MIGS Limited, said, “It is with great enthusiasm that we announce that the Malta Gaming Authority has confirmed that it will support MIGS 2015. Without MGA’s continued support over the last seven years, we would not be able to offer such a quality event.”\n\nFor more information go to www.maltaigamingseminar.com"

    "html": "NEWS\n23 June 2015\nA year of change for Malta’s gaming regulator – MGA publishes its 2014 annual report\n\n2014 was a year of change for the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) the regulatory body responsible for the governance of all land-based and remote gaming activities in Malta.\n\n“2014 has been a very intensive year for the MGA as we embarked on a wide-ranging transformation process of Malta’s jurisdictional positioning and the Authority’s strategic role within the European and global gaming sphere. Internally, we are reviewing and restructuring the organisation and all our internal processes to become more agile and proactive in the way we carry out our business,” said the Executive Chairman of the Malta Gaming Authority, Joseph Cuschieri. He also stressed that Malta is a role model for other countries due to its experience, diligence and transparency in regulating remote gaming.  Mr Cuschieri added that he was pleased to report that the gaming industry in Malta has had another successful year with substantial year on year growth in its portfolio of regulated companies.\n\nThe MGA’s 2014 annual report provides a detailed overview of the salient developments during the year under review. Throughout 2014, the Authority’s efforts were dedicated to developing more active and co-operative bilateral relations with other regulatory authorities, corporate rebranding and broad stakeholder engagement. The most important project initiated in 2014, led by the MGA’s legal team, was the review and total overhaul of Malta’s legal and regulatory gaming framework and attendant implementation mechanisms. This should lead to the presentation of draft proposals for Government, aimed at consolidating all legislation under a single framework providing for a consistent, technology-neutral, evidence-based and forward-looking governance of all gaming sectors in Malta.\n\nThe Authority in 2014 increased its resource infrastructure mainly to strengthen its enforcement, compliance, player protection and legal functions but also included investments in ICT and business intelligence. For the period 2015 – 2017, the MGA’s strategic plan aims to ensure a high level of integrity, efficiency, consumer protection and value in all gaming products and services across all supply channels. The Authority’s vision is translated into three mutually reinforcing objectives which are:\n\nQuality, integrity and consumer protection,\nImplementation of a responsive regulatory framework; and\nProactively looking and identifying new potential markets.\n\nThe Authority is facing its future challenges with optimism in order to lead in its core regulatory functions and become the jurisdiction of choice and the global centre of excellence in the remote gaming industry.\n\nThe 2014 Annual Report may be downloaded from HERE or a copy may be requested from the Authority."

It also started a programme of investment in IT systems and business intelligence. He also highlighted the objectives for the upcoming three years; that is to ensure high levels of integrity, efficiency, consumer protection, governance and value in gaming products.\n\nMr Cuschieri said that two thirds of the people who are employed in the gaming industry are foreigners, hence the need for more incentives for young Maltese professionals to join the gaming industry. In this respect, a new gaming academy will be launched later on this year, which should become fully operational in two years. The Authority is also aiming for more collaboration with other European regulators to facilitate licensing procedures and streamlining of technical standards. He added that new markets, quality and innovation should remain key priorities for the MGA. He concluded by saying that Malta can be a thought leader in the regulation of gaming and be a catalyst for change and reforms in the sector.\n\nDuring his speech, Parliamentary Secretary Hon. Dr. José Herrera said that the gaming authority is employing more qualified people coupled with more investment in training and development. He said that in this industry, efficiency and effectiveness is crucial. He added that the gaming industry is an important contributor to the country’s economic growth and development. Hon. Herrera stressed on the need to update regulatory legislation to cater for future challenges and dynamics."

The process proved to be effective, providing the MGA with the appropriate mechanism to approve independent and competent Service Providers as well as remove or suspend providers in case of unsatisfactory performance. The Authority has recently reviewed the requirements applicable to audit services to ensure that they remain up to date in view of the ongoing developments in the sector and in line with the MGA’s expectations.\n\nIn view of the Authority’s commitment to an open and transparent decision-making process, the MGA is issuing this consultation paper to communicate and refine its proposal in relation to revised Guidelines and promote a greater understanding of the proposal itself. The consultation, which will run until 17 December 2021, seeks feedback from the industry in relation to:\n\nthe amendments introduced in the Guidelines (as listed in Section 3 of the Consultation document); and\nthe extension of the applicability of the Guidelines to statutory audits carried out in accordance with international financial reporting standards as required by Article 41(2) of the Gaming Authorisations and Compliance Directive (Directive 3 of 2018).\n\nFollowing the consultation process, the Authority intends to publish its decision, including the final version of the Guidelines and any other supporting documents, by the end of the year 2021.\n\nAny queries and requests for clarifications that contributors may have in respect of the contents of the consultation paper and feedback from the interested parties shall be sent to the following email address: policy.mga@mga.org.mt."

This year’s meeting was attended by participants from 23 EU countries including Malta.\n\nThe MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri, accompanied by Chief Operating Officer, Heathcliff Farrugia and Chief Legal Officer, Dr Edwina Licari, attended the event, during which issues about the challenges being faced by European Gaming Regulators, such as the changes in taxation, responsible gambling and addiction, match fixing, and suspicious activity reporting were discussed. A presentation on EU developments regarding gambling was also delivered by Harrie Temmink (Deputy Head of online and postal unit at DG Internal Market).\n\nFrom Left to Right: MGA’s Chief Legal Officer, Dr Edwina Licari, Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri and Chief Operating Officer, Heathcliff Farrugia\n\nThe objective of this forum is to provide an opportunity where European gaming regulators can network, exchange views and information and discuss policy on gaming matters.\n\nMr Cuschieri added, “It is essential that the Malta Gaming Authority participates in this annual event. It is the ideal forum where European Gaming Regulators come together to discuss challenges related to the Gaming Sector. It further strengthens my belief that European jurisdictions can achieve more if regulators work together. By developing a common way forward, this sector can thrive in a more responsible way.”\n\nThis year the biannual election of the Executive Board of GREF took place and Malta, following Heathcliff Farrugia’s nomination and appointment has for the second time round been selected for membership, with the first dating back to 2001. “We hope to contribute and support GREF to roll out its annual work programme over the next two years and to maximise its role in achieving regulatory cooperation in Europe,” continued Mr Cuschieri.\n\nDuring the event Mr Cuschieri presented a short video showcasing Malta, being the selected host country for the next annual GREF meeting taking place in 2016.\n\nThe MGA formally thanks the GREF Executive Board as well as the Gaming Control Authority (GCA) of Lithuania for organising such a successful event."

This year’s meeting was attended by participants from all over the US together with a number of European sector professionals.\n\nThe MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri attended the event, having been invited as one of the distinguished speakers for the session entitled ‘Through the eyes of the pioneers: Top iGaming Tips from the Europeans’ which was moderated by Nick Nocton (Director, Jeffrey Green Russell Limited).\n\nIn his intervention, Mr Cuschieri stated that “It is important that the Malta Gaming Authority opens up to the US inter-state gaming regulatory approach to retain a horizontal gaming market outlook outside the EU, with the aim of achieving alignment in relevant areas of common interest for the gaming sector to flourish responsibly and effectively within and outside the EU market.  It is one of the right fora to share regulatory experiences across the continent and listen to operators’ operational outlook within a diverging gaming regulatory environment. The US brick and mortar debate vs. the online providers, certainly unveils sensitive arguments worth considering from a local regulatory front, to achieve the desired regulatory balance between online and land based operations, particularly within the backdrop of an ongoing technological converging gaming market.”\n\nDuring the event Mr Cuschieri outlined his ideas on Malta’s future role in the gaming sphere together with upcoming developments from a regulatory front. He emphasised the need for closer bilateral relationships between European regulators to streamline technical standards and interoperability so that compliance is simplified. This forum was a platform for various relevant discussions dealing with the emergence of digital gaming and regulation, market outlook on the US as well as scrutiny of the economics underpinning the iGaming industry generally amongst other topics."

    "html": "NEWS\n29 May 2015\nThe Malta Gaming Authority approves the first Cruise Liner Casino\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) has approved the first application received from Crystal Cruises, which is represented in Malta by Gollcher Group, for its award-winning Crystal Serenity which will call to Malta on June 5 and 6, 2015. Crystal’s lavish onboard casinos on Crystal Serenity are elegantly stylish venues offering gaming and glittering excitement.  Thrilling games of Blackjack, Craps, Roulette, 3 Card Poker™, Ultimate Texas Hold’em™ and Mini-Baccarat (on request), as well as slot and video poker machines are available.\n\n“Valletta Cruise Port welcomes this first application, following our instigation to introduce this legislation. This legislation makes Malta a more attractive proposition to cruise liners particularly those cruise liners that opt to call at Malta or Gozo for an overnight stay. This is undoubtedly an incentive to encourage cruise liners to overnight in Malta or Gozo, and include both islands in their Mediterranean itinerary.  Valletta Cruise Port has been promoting these regulations, and feedback from other cruise lines has been positive”, commented Stephen Xuereb, Valletta Cruise Port’s Chief Executive Officer.\n\n“The Authority is committed to safeguard both the interests of passengers on board cruise ships, as well as those of the Maltese gaming industry. The regulations issued by the MGA mean that cruise ships will be able to operate their casinos in-line with the stipulated conditions whilst berthed within Maltese territorial waters,” said the MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri.\n\nParliamentary Secretary Hon. Dr. José Herrera said, “This is indeed very good and exciting news, which augurs well for the future. These new regulations were the result of direct consultation with the relevant stakeholders.” Dr. Herrera hailed both the MGA and Valletta Cruise Port for their commitment to increase the gaming and cruise industries.\n\nThe MGA launched its Cruise Casino Regulations in April 2015, wherein cruise liners are now able to operate their onboard casinos solely for registered passengers while berthing in Malta and/or Gozo overnight and within territorial waters. These Regulations are a result of the policy announced by Government last November during the 2015 Budget speech.\n\nThe Regulations lay down that a formal application for this purpose must be submitted to the MGA, which, in turn, issues such approval once it is satisfied that gaming on board the cruise liner casino shall take place in accordance with the fundamental principles established by the Authority. Once approval is granted, cruise liner casinos will be allowed to operate between 6.00pm and 6.00am in line with the conditions stipulated in these new Regulations.\n\nThe MGA has also set up a dedicated page on the website providing all the necessary information and forms related to obtaining the MGA’s approval which can be accessed on the following link."

These Regulations are a result of the policy announced by Government last November during the 2015 Budget speech. The Regulations aim to regulate casino operations on board cruise ships, which are either berthed in Malta, Gozo or within Maltese territorial waters.\n\nFrom Left to Right: Parliamentary Secretary for Competitiveness and Economic Growth Hon. Dr José Herrera, MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri and Chief Executive Officer of Valletta Cruise Port, Stephen Xuereb at the launch of the Cruise Casino Regulations\n\nThe MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri said that the MGA introduced the Cruise Liner Casino Regulations to ensure that fair play and player protection processes on board cruise ships are in place.\n\n“Through the Cruise Liner Casino Regulations, we will be able to safeguard both the interests of passengers on board cruise ships, as well as those of the Maltese gaming industry. Cruise ships that are issued with the necessary approval by the MGA will be able to operate their casinos in line with the stipulated conditions whilst berthed here,” added Mr Cuschieri.\n\n“Valletta Cruise Port welcomes the publication of the new casino regulations, following our instigation of the process in recent years.

Dr. José Herrera stated that through the introduction of these regulations the Government has taken into consideration the private sector to incentivise these two industries: gaming and the cruise liners. This measure being implemented by the Government was announced during the last budget. As such this secretariat has already accomplished three important propositions from their announcement in the budget: the Authority’s branding, the launch of GamingMalta and the new regulations for the cruise casinos, said Jose’ Herrera.\n\nJosé Herrera praised the Malta Gaming Authority’s commitment that is increasing being pro-active in its efforts to promote job opportunities and investment on our shores.\n\n“Through the implementation of these new regulations, cruise liner operators can apply for approval to operate their onboard casinos. The Authority will be assuring the best principles of fair play and player protection. Therefore the need to regulate arises, to ensure that we build upon the good reputation that our jurisdiction holds,” said the Parliamentary Secretary.\n\nThe government reiterates its commitment to improve these industries to create more quality job opportunities for our country.\n\nThe Regulations lay down that a formal application for this purpose must be submitted to the MGA, which, in turn, issues such approval once it is satisfied that gaming on board the cruise liner casino shall take place in accordance with the fundamental principles established by the Authority. Once approval is granted, cruise liner casinos will be allowed to operate for the duration of their stay, in line with the conditions stipulated in these new regulations. The conditions attached to the approval, stipulate, for instance, that only those persons listed on the passenger manifest of that particular voyage can gamble at the vessel’s casino, and that the casino is only operated during the time window specified in the MGA approval.\n\nThe Cruise Casino Regulations (S.L. 400.03) are being issued under the Gaming Act (Chapter 400 of the Laws of Malta) and are available online through this link.\n\nFor more information on these regulations, one can contact the Authority by calling +356 25469000 or sending an email to info@mga.com.mt.\n\nA brochure about these regulations has also been issued for guidance purposes, and may be accessed here.\n\nThe Authority has also set up a dedicated page on the website providing all the necessary information and forms related to obtaining the MGA’s approval which can be accessed here."
