    "html": "NEWS\n16 December 2014\nConsultation | Proposed Digital Games of Skill with Prize\n\nThe Lotteries and Gaming Authority of Malta (LGA) has recognised certain concerns due to the lack of specific regulation regarding digital games of skill with prize via distance communication that are offered commercially.  Other legislation, mainly consumer legislation, addresses certain facets of the offering of these games.  Nevertheless, the LGA feels that specific regulation of this form of gaming, or guidelines relating thereto, may be required.\n\nHowever, the authority is cognisant of the fact that changing from one environment to another would present new challenges which operators and the regulator alike will require getting accustomed to. In this light, this consultation seeks to elicit the industry’s view of a regulated market for this sector and any other feedback which the industry may have.\n\nWe ask the gaming industry and wider interest groups to engage constructively with the questions raised in this consultation.\n\nClick Here to Download – LGA Digital Games of Skill  with Price\n\nAll responses should be sent by email to skillgames.mga@mga.org.mt by February 4th 2015.\n\nAlternatively, responses can be sent by post to:\n\nSkill Games\nLotteries and Gaming Authority\nSuite 1, Level 3, TG Complex,\nBrewery Street Mriehel,\nBKR 3000,\nMalta\n\n "

This included a complete refresh of its corporate branding to better reflect the industry’s challenges, focus on Malta as the jurisdiction of choice and signal a new vision for the industry.  “The new name and logo will serve as a better representation of the Authority’s heritage, past successes, vision and values within the national agenda and in line with our strategic objectives”. This was announced by the Executive Chairman of the Malta Gaming Authority, Joseph Cuschieri during the launch of the new corporate identity for the Authority which was presided by the Minister for the Economy, Investment and Small Business, Dr Chris Cardona and Parliamentary Secretary for Competitiveness and Economic Growth, Dr José Herrera.\n\nFrom Left to Right: Hon. Minister – Dr Chris Cardona, Executive Chairman – Mr. Joseph Cuschieri, Hon. Parliamentary Secretary – Dr. José Herrera\n\nThe new corporate logo was launched during an event at the Westin Dragonara Resort, where the Executive Chairman gave an overview about the values behind the new corporate branding which consist of transparency, care, integrity and responsibility.\n\nThe event also saw the launch of the MGA’s new intuitive website at mgaorgmt.kinsta.cloud, with a highly improved look and feel. The new portal makes use of the latest technology like responsive web design, aimed at providing an optimal viewing experience to users on desktop monitors, laptops, smart phones and tablets. It also offers a unique opportunity for players to communicate directly with the Player Support team of the Authority through the live chat facility.  Furthermore, the MGA also announced the launch of its social media presence, through new Facebook and Twitter pages including a revamped LinkedIn page.  All the digital media channels will be updated on a regular basis.\n\nSince 2001, the LGA has been the public single regulatory body responsible for the governance of all forms of gaming in Malta, including: Amusement Machines, Broadcasting Media Games, Casinos, Commercial Bingo Halls, Gaming Devices, the National Lottery, Non-Profit Games and Remote Gaming.\n\nToday, Malta is at the forefront of the remote gaming industry, hosting some of the world’s biggest online gaming operators and hailed as one of the top remote gaming jurisdictions in the world. In light of such accomplishments, the MGA will continue to competently regulate the various sectors of the gaming industry which fall under its responsibility by ensuring that; gaming is fair and transparent to the players, preventing crime and money laundering, and by protecting minors and vulnerable players. The successful establishment of the Responsible Gaming Foundation and the introduction of Gaming Malta and the Gaming Academy later this year will continue to consolidate Malta’s position as a centre of excellence. From this position of strength, the MGA will keep innovating and optimising its operations for the benefit of all stakeholders."

    "html": "NEWS\n15 September 2022\nThe MGA publishes its 2021 Annual Report and Financial Statements\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority (MGA/Authority) is publishing its Annual Report and audited Financial Statements for the financial year ending 31 December 2021. The report provides an overview of the Authority’s achievements during the year under review and outlines the performance of the Maltese gaming industry during 2021, coupled with a medium-term outlook into the future. This is also followed by a detailed report explaining key statistics for the land-based and online gaming sectors.\n\n  Supervisory Activities\n\n54 on-site compliance audits were conducted and 230 desktop reviews were carried out, accounting for 65.5% coverage of the licensees base during 2021, accompanied by additional AML/CFT compliance examinations that are carried out by the FIAU, or the MGA on its behalf.Following information which emerged from compliance audits, compliance reviews and formal investigations, the Authority issued 64 warnings and cancelled seven (7) licences. In addition, the MGA issued a total of 31 administrative penalties as well as three (3) regulatory settlements, with a collective total financial penalty of €176,016.\nAn additional 10 licensees were subject to enforcement measures by the FIAU, ranging from written reprimands to administrative penalties, based on the breaches identified during examinations carried out in previous years, including by the MGA. In total these amounted to just over €863,000.\n13 individuals and companies were deemed not to be up to the Authority’s probity standards by the Fit & Proper Committee, mainly on the basis of mitigating the risks of money laundering or funding of terrorism. An additional three (3) applications were rejected by the Supervisory Council.\nOver 1,150 criminal probity screening checks were undertaken on individuals., shareholders and ultimate beneficial owners, key persons and other employees, and companies from both the land-based and online gaming sectors.\nThe Authority continued with its commitment to supervise its online gaming licensees and conducted 91 interviews with prospective MLROs and key persons carrying out the AML/CFT function to determine the knowledge and suitability of each candidate.\nThe Commercial Communication Committee of the MGA issued a total of 21 letters of Breach, of which 13 operators were found to be in breach of the Commercial Communications Regulations, (S.L. 583.09).\nIn its efforts to protect players and encourage responsible gambling the Authority assisted a total of 6,170 players that requested assistance, covering most of the cases received during 2021 and the spill-over from 2020.\nThe MGA also investigated 79 cases of websites having misleading references to the Authority and published a total of 61 notices on its website with the aim to prevent the public from falling victim to such scams. Furthermore, an additional 26 responsible gambling website checks were conducted.\nA sectoral risk assessment on money laundering and funding of terrorism-related risks affecting the land-based and online gaming sectors in Malta was undertaken.\n\nImprovements in Efficiency and Effectiveness\n\nWith the aim of reducing any unnecessary bureaucracy on its licensees, the Authority has reviewed the Gaming Licence Application Process as well as launched the Personal Portfolio.\nImprovements have been made in the way non-compliance matters are notified to the relevant licensee, and how operators are directed to rectify their position.\nThe MGA published amendments to the ‘Guidance on the use of Innovative Technology Arrangements and the acceptance of Virtual Financial Assets and Virtual Tokens through the implementation of a Sandbox Environment’.\nAmendments to Article 22 of the Player Protection Directive (Directive 2 of 2018) were published, accompanied by a policy paper on ‘Amending the Return to Player Minimum Percentage’. Such amendments aim to streamline the minimum Return to Player percentage applicable to licensees across all sectors.\nA series of amendments to the Gaming Authorisations and Compliance Directive (Directive 3 of 2018) were published, including the extension of the applicability of suspicious betting reporting requirements to B2B licensees as well as broader amendments to the key functions. The latter was accompanied by the introduction of the Key Function Eligibility Criteria Policy which outlines the requirements the persons holding the various key functions are expected to fulfil in order to satisfactorily perform these duties which are vital for the applicable regulatory outcomes.\nA public consultation on the Applicability of the System and Compliance Audit Service Provider Guidelines to Financial Audit was issued with the aim of communicating and refining the proposal being put forward in relation to revised Guidelines and in order to promote a greater understanding of the proposal itself.\nThe Authority established a dedicated Business Transformation team, tasked with assisting each of the MGA’s directorates to continuously re-assess and improve processes, to increase efficiency and reduce administrative burdens on the MGA and industry alike, and to focus resources where these truly provide added value.\n\nNational and International Cooperation\n\nA new alerting process was introduced vis-à-vis the sharing of knowledge on suspicious events that is reported with the whole industry without revealing the source of the information. Since its introduction, during the last quarter of 2021, a total of 72 alerts were sent to the industry, which resulted in a total of 20 new suspicious betting reports received via the Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism after such alerts were corresponded.\nA total of 131 requests for information specifically relating to the manipulation of sports competitions or breaches in sports rules were submitted by enforcement agencies, sport governing bodies, integrity units, and other regulatory bodies. As a result of such requests, data was exchanged in 41 instances. Additionally, a total of 329 suspicious betting reports from licensees and other concerned parties were received.\nDuring the period under review, the Authority was a direct participant in 20 different investigations across the globe relating to the manipulation of sports competitions or breaches in sports rules, as well as an indirect participant in 29 such investigations.\nThe Authority received a total of 89 international cooperation requests from other regulators and sent 75 such requests, with the majority referring to requests for background checks as part of an authorisation process.\nA total of 125 letters of Good Standing were issued providing feedback on the regulatory good standing of our licenced operators to the relevant authorities asking for this information.\nAn International Affairs Strategy has been devised as one of the measures aimed at enhancing Malta’s international credibility, fostering collaborative relationships with targeted stakeholders and mitigating the risks that the gaming industry in Malta is facing.\nIn collaboration with the Malta Institute of Accountants two technical release notices were published, “Audit 02/21 Gaming Tax Payable and Levy on Gaming Devices” and “Audit 02/21 – Player Funds and Jackpot Funds”.\nThrough a joint collaboration between the Authority, the FIAU and the MFSA, a document was published providing an overview of the key findings of Business Risk Assessments carried out by subject persons as per their obligations under the PMLFTR and the FIAU’s Implementing Procedures.\nA two-day workshop in collaboration with Bank of Valletta was organised, whereby various aspects of the control mechanisms as a Regulator were discussed.\n\nIn publishing this report, the CEO, Dr Carl Brincat said: “As an organisation, beyond continuing to ensure that we meet our day-to-day objectives, we used 2021 to start laying the groundwork for improvements that we will see in the months and years to come.  It is a priority for us to move towards leaner and more efficient processes, to remove unnecessary bureaucracy which introduces burdens on the industry without providing added value, and to become more effective in achieving our regulatory priorities.”"

    "html": "NEWS\n22 September 2022\nMGA Conducts Review of Fiscal Receipts Lottery\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) has embarked on a review exercise of the current Fiscal Receipts Lottery and made a series of recommendations to the Ministry for Finance and Employment.\n\nIn line with Directive 1 of 2020, entitled ‘VAT Fiscal Receipt Lottery Directive’, the Fiscal Receipts Lottery is deemed to be an exempt game in terms of the Second Schedule of the Regulations, thus it does not fall under the MGA’s oversight. Nevertheless, the MGA has lent its experience and knowledge to ensure the fair and transparent proceedings of the Lottery.\n\nDuring inspections carried out by MGA officials, it was noted that the current lottery standard operating procedures already have safeguards in place to ensure the fairness of the draw. All the received receipts are first put in containers, which are then poured into a raffle drum, that is turned after a fixed number of containers is reached and the drum is filled.  Once full, the power switch which is used to turn the raffle drum is locked with a numbered seal (disabling any movement) to avoid tampering with any of the tickets. This is also photographed, and the photo is then sent to the CFR department. The numbered seal is only cut in the presence of the board members responsible for the draw. The board comprises of a government notary, representatives from the CFR department, the Ministry for Finance and Employment, the National Audit Office, and a representative from the Public. The person that draws the tickets is chosen by the Ministry for Finance and Employment and changes at every draw. Following the draw, all remaining receipts are disposed of.\n\nAn in-depth assessment of the lottery draw; from the collection stage to the drawing stage, has been conducted by MGA officials to identify any gaps and potential issues in the process. Recommendations have already been submitted and discussed together with the Ministry for Finance and Employment.\n\nThe Fiscal Receipts Lottery involves the draw of fiscal receipts sent by the public to the Ministry for Finance and Employment. The lottery, introduced in 1990, has grown significantly over the years, with the draws reaching around 3 million fiscal receipts per month.\n\nThe Fiscal Receipts Lottery Unit and the Authority are committed to taking all the necessary actions to ensure increased transparency in relation to this lottery."

    "html": "NEWS\n30 October 2014\nThe Upper Reach Team interviewed Mr. Joseph Cuschieri Executive Chairman of the Lotteries and Gaming Authority\n\nThe Upper Reach Team interviewed Mr. Joseph Cuschieri Executive Chairman of the Lotteries and Gaming Authority, and asked him about the importance of the gaming industry in Malta. He spoke about the evolution of the gaming industry in Malta and outlined why Malta became the gaming centre in Europe. Upper Reach also discussed the LGA’s licensing program and its control methods, as well as the authority’s plans to orient towards the East in order to take full advantage of the new markets and opportunities emerging there.\n\nThis is a year of celebration for Malta, not just of how far you have come in the last 50 years of independence but also many other celebrations. Many countries in the European Union are going through hard times, while Malta is doing very well. I would like to ask you, what is the recipe for success in Malta?\n\nMalta managed to steer itself safely through the crisis. If we look back at 2008, I think one of the most important aspects of our economic dynamics is our banking system: it is a very conservative, robust and well capitalised banking system. The banks here do not take unnecessary risks. We also have a strong regulatory framework which keeps the banking system in check. So, unlike other countries, we didn’t have to use taxpayers’ money to re-capitalise banks like other countries had to do.\n\nThe other aspect I think is the openness and diversity of our economy and the entrepreneurial spirit of many Maltese businessmen. The vast majority of the largest businesses in Malta are usually family-run businesses who are involved in different sectors of the economy including overseas investments. So, for example, you can have a group of companies which is involved in the automobile business, tourism, property and retail.  So if one sector is not doing well, there are other sectors that keep going hence compensating for the downturn in others. In other European jurisdictions if, for example, you are solely involved in the automobile business and the business experience a downturn, they will have no option but to lay off people to keep the business running.\n\nFast forward to today, we have a new administration which is very dynamic and business friendly. In fact, this year we will probably close the year with a 2.8% to 3% growth in our GDP, which is very good by any standard. Unemployment is at roughly the 6 percent level. Some of this unemployment is a result of the skills mismatch with the new economic sectors like remote gaming, ICT and e-commerce. In remote gaming, for example, two thirds of the people employed in this sector are foreigners. While there is nothing wrong in that, the fact is that there are jobs for the Maltese, but there isn’t the skill available to fill certain positions. In other sectors like ICT services, it’s the same thing. There are opportunities but the unemployed are people who either don’t want to work or don’t have the skills for these new growing economic sectors. I would call it artificial unemployment, because the economy overall is growing.\n\nTo continue reading, go to the full interview HERE."

    "html": "NEWS\n31 October 2014\nConsultation | Proposed Cloud Solutions for Remote Gaming Industry\n\nThe Lotteries and Gaming Authority of Malta (LGA) has recognised the advantages and options cloud solutions provide to the remote gaming industry in general. It allows for significant cuts in infrastructure and operational costs, better management and allocation of IT resources, flexibility and scalability of operations.\n\nHowever, the authority is cognisant of the fact that changing from one environment to another presents new challenges which operators and regulators alike are doing their best to address both from a policy and operational standpoint. It is the intention of the LGA to release guidelines for the Remote Gaming operators making use of cloud solutions. It will also allow facilities to be used as cloud service providers in defined circumstances for gaming transactions.\n\nThis consultation is proposing a sharper focus on long-standing principles, with a clearer explanation of why they are important from a policy and regulatory perspective.\n\nWe ask the gaming industry and wider interest groups to engage constructively with the questions raised in this consultation.\n\nProposed Cloud Solutions for Remote Gaming Industry\n\n All responses should be sent by email to cloud.lga@lga.org.mt by 12 December 2014.\n\nAlternatively, responses can be sent by post to:\nCloud Solutions\nLotteries and Gaming Authority\nSuite 1, Level 3, TG Complex,\nBrewery Street Mriehel, BKR 3000, Malta"

    "html": "NEWS\n6 November 2014\nThe Lotteries and Gaming Authority issues its interim performance results\n\nThe Lotteries and Gaming Authority (LGA) has announced its interim results covering the six months ended 30 June 2014, during a Press Conference held at the Hilton Hotel, on Thursday November 6, 2014.\n\nThe LGA announced that the number of licences issued in 2014 went up by 25% to 401 when compared to 321 in 2013. The number of registered companies also went up by 17% to 258 when compared to 220 in 2013, whilst total revenue went up by 1.3% when compared to same period of last year. At the same time license processing time has been reduced by 50%, from an average of 5 months to an average of 2.5 months.\n\n“I am satisfied with what the LGA has achieved so far both in terms of financial and regulatory performance,” said Joseph Cuschieri, Executive Chairman of the Lotteries and Gaming Authority. “Malta is a major player in the global remote gaming industry and our solid reputation was instrumental for our growth trajectory. Having said this, what got us here won’t take us there hence the importance of innovation and reform in order to maintain a competitive edge and stay ahead of other jurisdictions. This, coupled with the support of a business friendly government which strongly believes in the gaming industry, is crucial in our efforts to future proof this industry for the next decade.”\n\nMr. Cuschieri continued his address by highlighting other initiatives taking place at the LGA, with major focus on the regulatory overhaul which will see the launch of a new innovative and cutting edge legal framework, towards the end of next year. He also underscored the Authority’s office relocation to Smart City Malta, the market repositioning program and also other activities related to the EU and international fora. Finally LGA’s Executive Chairman also highlighted LGA’s latest consultation document on Cloud Solutions, which is available online on www.lga.org.mt.\n\nDr Herrera was next to address the press, and he spoke about the importance of having a skilled labour force. “We need to be more competitive and have a stronger workforce” he said, and stressed the need for more people to widen their technical knowledge and be employed within the gaming industry. “A survey carried out in 2013 shows that 77% of foreign companies do not find enough Maltese workers that have the necessary skills to work in this sector.” Dr Hererra explained how the launch of the Gaming Academy in the first quarter of next year, is set to be one of the steps taken by the Authority that will help to increase employment rates in Malta in this sector."

During the same period total operating expenditure amounted to €2.9m compared to €3.3m in 2012. Furthermore, the Authority registered a surplus amounting to €49.9m compared to €49.5m in 2012. As a result, the LGA transferred to Government the amount of €48.8m compared to €47.5m in the previous year.\n\nCommenting on these results, LGA Executive Chairman Joseph Cuschieri said that: “These results continue to sustain the importance and value creation ability of the gaming industry for the Maltese economy. The Authority is currently undergoing a major restructuring, investment and capacity building programme in order to strengthen the LGA’s operational structures and define a new future proof strategy for the Authority and for the gaming industry itself. This will have the benefit of driving growth for the industry and reposition Malta as the top gaming jurisdiction globally. We have set out an ambitious reformist and growth agenda which we are focused on delivering”.\n\nMr Cuschieri took the opportunity to introduce his new executive management team which is now composed of Ing.

    "title": "Malta files a request to the Court of Justice of the European Union related to the Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions - Malta Gaming Authority",
    "url": "https://www.mga.org.mt/malta-files-request-court-justice-european-union-related-convention-manipulation-sports-competitions/",
    "html": "NEWS\n18 July 2014\nMalta files a request to the Court of Justice of the European Union related to the Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions\n\nOn the 9th July 2014, the Council of Europe adopted the Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions, following the taking of a vote during a meeting of the Committee of Ministers. 43 states voted in favour of adoption. Owing to the circumstances, Malta voted against the adoption of the Convention. While Malta has always agreed with the objective of the Convention to combat match-fixing, it held the view that the sports betting provisions have gone beyond the scope.\n\nThe Convention will now be opened for signature of the various States on the 18th September in Macolin, Switzerland.\n\nMeanwhile, Malta has filed a request for opinion of the Courts of Justice of the European Union under the procedure set out in Article 218 (11) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), asking the Court to clarify whether the envisaged Convention, and in particular the definition of “illegal sports betting”, coupled with the betting provisions, Articles 9 and 11 thereof, are compatible with the Treaties and in particular, with Articles 18, 49 and 56 TFEU.\n\nMalta, represented by the Lotteries and Gaming Authority (the LGA) and other relevant local entities, joined the drafting negotiations of a draft Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions in March 2013 and participated actively until January 2014 when the drafting plenary group closed. Thereafter, it continued to take an active interest in the different political processes which followed until adoption, in order to clearly deliver and maintain its position on the matter.\n\nWhile Malta has always agreed with the objectives of this Convention that are principally aimed to combat manipulation and fraud in sports, it has maintained reservations on the betting provisions which in its view, have gone beyond the objectives and scope of the Convention.\n\nSince the beginning of the drafting process, Malta has objected to the definition of “illegal sports betting” (Article 3.5.a) which is linked to the notion of national authorisation and the jurisdiction where the consumer is located. Through its application, sports betting activity in any one state shall be considered illegal if the applicable law of the jurisdiction of the consumer of the betting service considers it to be so. Thus, the definition does not specifically target unregulated sports betting that can entice the manipulation of sports and fraud, which is the subject of the Convention. On the contrary, it targets operators which are merely ‘not allowed’ in the jurisdiction of the consumer, with the consequence that the definition encompasses not only unregulated operators but also regulated operators in Contracting Parties to the Convention.\n\nFurther provisions in the Convention relating to betting (Articles 9 to 11) set rules to be imposed on “illegal” betting operators. Article 11 in particular lays down a number of measures which may be taken against “illegal” betting operators. Operators operating across borders which are legally compliant and subject to the monitoring and control measures foreseen by the draft Convention, may therefore be deemed illegal by the law of the country of the consumer and blocked through a variety of methods allowed by the Convention.\n\nThis clearly misses the paramount objective of the Convention to holistically address the risks to sports integrity, and has the unnecessary and harmful effect of clamping down on regulated operators. It also has the consequence of requiring Contracting Parties to act against each other’s duly regulated operators. The net effect is an unwelcome divergence from the Convention’s objectives and an unnecessary intrusion into the regulation of betting, with negative consequences for regulated operators and legitimate regulated betting industries.\n\nMalta was always consistent as regard its objections on these provisions from the start of the negotiations. During the Standing Committee meeting that took place in Baku on the 23rd May, Malta made a proposal for the amendment of the definition. Although it gained some support, this proposal was not accepted. Malta made further proposals during the Gr-C meetings of the Council of Europe on 17th June, 1st and 8th July respectively, which were rejected. Consequently, in the circumstances Malta had no option but to vote against the adoption of this Convention, while making clear that it continues to fully support the objectives.\n\nOn a European Union level, Malta has always maintained the view that the definition of “illegal sports betting” and the other betting provisions in the Convention are incompatible with the Treaties. The gaming industry is not yet regulated within the EU and discussions regarding the best approach are still underway in various fora. The provisions of the Convention relating to betting may lead to harmonisation of an area that is not yet harmonized at EU level, thus going beyond the scope of the Convention itself as it is not the appropriate instrument to deal with these matters.\n\nMalta declared these reservations during the negotiations of the Convention. The European Commission, which received a mandate to participate in the drafting negotiations, tried to pacify the various positions of the Member States. Despite this as well as various attempts from Malta, the majority of the countries, including EU Member States, were in favour of maintaining the definition that makes reference to the country of the consumer and the other betting provisions.\n\nMalta has now filed a request under the Article 218 (11) TFEU procedure to the Court of Justice of the European Union. By means of this procedure, Malta hopes to clarify amongst other arguments, whether the definition of “illegal sports betting” in the Convention, as well as the other articles ancillary to the definition, are compatible with the provisions of the Treaty.\n\nMalta holds that the envisaged Convention seeks to introduce the regulation of the betting industry, which is not a settled matter in the EU. The Convention is thus an inappropriate instrument for the matter and is being used to bypass the correct procedures under the Treaty, which can also impact on the future of the passing of regulation in the sector. The definition which has been introduced in the Convention relates exclusively to the licensing and regulation of operators, which is not the subject of the Convention. The question of legality of the gaming industry has to be viewed in line with the general principles guaranteed by the Treaty and in particular with what is necessary, suitable and proportional.\n\nMalta, its government and the LGA have always prioritised the interests of its successful gaming industry. The gaming industry is effectively regulated and Malta will continue to defend its operators’ interests in the face of this and similar attempts against it."

The LGA’s Executive Chairman, Mr. Joseph Cuschieri invited the Management Board of the Council to discuss the strategy of the Authority and introduce the new Management team. Mr. Cuschieri highlighted the areas and processes within the Authority where he deems most important to become more efficient and less bureaucratic. He also acknowledged the challenges the industry is facing and expressed his commitment to strengthen the industry and retain Malta’s position as a top gaming jurisdiction.\n\nOn their part MRGC highlighted where and how the Industry had benefitted in the past by working closely with the LGA with common objectives. Both parties expressed their satisfaction to have the opportunity to meet and committed themselves to work together to achieve further growth in the industry. The LGA invited the Council to consult with the Authority on issues of concern in the gaming industry in order to assess possible solutions.\n\nMr. Cuschieri closed the meeting by thanking the Council for meeting with the Authority and for their offer of full co-operation whilst assuring them that this would be the first of many productive meetings. He concluded that whilst he wanted to streamline and improve processes at no time would the Authority relax its regulatory obligations and it would be re-focusing its efforts and resources on the high risk matters rather than on checklists and unnecessary red tape that provided no value to the industry or comfort to the regulator."

Such collaboration shall augment even further, the existing deterrents and shall ensure that the possibility of achieving unfair winnings, (a phenomenon which is particularly present with respect to unregulated betting activities) remains shut out of the regulated markets, such as that regulated by the LGA.\n\nThe EWS – LGA MOU shall bring together FIFA’s early warning system, the LGA and its betting licensees to exchange betting-related information to assist the investigation of betting patterns or insider betting connected with sporting events and competitions.\n\nThe MOU was signed by Mr Reuben Portanier, CEO of the Lotteries and Gaming Authority and Dr Urs Scherrer, CEO of FIFA Early Warning System GmbH.\n\nCommenting on this important collaboration, Malta’s Minister of Finance, the Economy and Industry, Mr Tonio Fenech, stated that such a collaborative agreement between the LGA and FIFA reflects the importance that the Maltese Legislation places on game fairness in all senses. Minister Fenech also stated that Malta has, in addition to very strict Gaming Legislation, a specific legal framework to prevent corruption in sports. Thus, such collaboration forms an important addition to complement the intention and spirit of the law. Minister Fenech congratulated both the LGA and the FIFA Early Warning System for engaging in such a collaborative framework."

As a result, the LGA transferred to Government the amount of €48.8m compared to €47.5m in the previous year.\n\nCommenting on these results, LGA Executive Chairman Joseph Cuschieri said that: “These results continue to sustain the importance and value creation ability of the gaming industry for the Maltese economy. The Authority is currently undergoing a major restructuring, investment and capacity building programme in order to strengthen the LGA’s operational structures and define a new future proof strategy for the Authority and for the gaming industry itself. This will have the benefit of driving growth for the industry and reposition Malta as the top gaming jurisdiction globally. We have set out an ambitious reformist and growth agenda which we are focused on delivering”.\n\nMr Cuschieri took the opportunity to introduce his new executive management team which is now composed of Ing. Paul Fenech (Chief Officer – Strategy & Business Planning), Dr Dominic Micallef (Chief Officer – Investigations and Enforcement), Vincent Marmara (Chief Regulatory Officer), Dr Edwina Licari (Chief Legal Officer), Heathcliff Farrugia (Chief Operations Officer) and Carlo Mifsud (Chief Financial Officer). Commenting on his new executive team Mr Cuschieri said: “This is an excellent group of talented and professional individuals who possess strong academic backgrounds and work experience whom I am convinced can help me steer the LGA towards more future success”.\n\nThe LGA Financial Statements as approved by the Board are available for downloading on the Authority’s site at www.lga.org.mt"

A review of the Authority’s accomplishments for the first half of 2022 is provided in the report, together with a description of the Maltese gaming industry’s performance over the same period. The latter provides a medium-term outlook towards the future, as well as an analysis outlining important statistics for the land-based and online gaming industries.\n\nSupervisory Activities\n\nDuring this period, 16 compliance audits were conducted together with 114 desktop reviews, accompanied by an additional seven AML/CFT compliance examinations that were initiated by the MGA on behalf of the FIAU. Additionally, the Authority issued a warning, cancelled a licence as well as suspended another authorised entity, following information which emerged from compliance audits, compliance reviews and formal investigations. Furthermore, the MGA issued a total of seven administrative penalties as well as two regulatory settlements, with a collective total financial penalty of €85,000.\nEnforcement measures were also issued by the FIAU to an additional four licensees, ranging from written reprimands to administrative penalties, with an emphasis on remediation measures, based on the breaches identified during examinations carried out in previous years, including by the MGA. In total, these amounted to just over €386,567.\nBased primarily on reducing the risk of money laundering or funding terrorism, the Fit & Proper Committee determined that four individuals and entities did not meet the Authority’s fit and properness criteria, while an additional two applications were rejected by the Supervisory Council.\nA total of 626 criminal probity screening checks were undertaken on personnel, shareholders, ultimate beneficial owners, key individuals, employees, and businesses from the land-based and online gambling sectors.\nIn the first half of the year, 22 interviews with prospective money laundering reporting officers (MLROs) and key persons carrying out the AML/CFT function were carried out, with the aim of determining the knowledge and suitability of each candidate.\nA total of six letters of breach were issued by the MGA’s Commercial Communications Committee (S.L. 583.09), out of which five operators were deemed to have violated the Commercial Communications Regulations.\nIn its efforts to safeguard players and promote responsible gaming, the Authority assisted a total of 2,578 players who requested assistance, covering the majority of the cases received during 2022 and the spillover from 2021.\nA total of 22 cases of websites having misleading references to the Authority were investigated, while a total of 13 notices were published on the MGA’s website with the aim of preventing the public from falling victim to such scams. Furthermore, an additional 18 responsible gambling website checks were conducted, and five observation letters were issued.\n\nNational and International Cooperation\n\nBetween January and June 2022, a total of 122 alerts on suspicious betting were sent to the industry. Following correspondence of these alerts, the Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism received a total of 16 new suspicious betting reports.\nEnforcement agencies, sports governing bodies, integrity units, and other regulatory authorities made a total of 23 requests for information, specifically in relation to the manipulation of sporting events or violations of sporting regulations. Subsequently, 10 of these requests resulted in the exchange of data. In addition, 278 allegations of suspicious betting from licensees and other interested parties were received.\nThe Authority participated directly in 12 separate investigations into sports rules violations or manipulation of sporting competitions during the time under review. In addition, the Authority also participated indirectly in another investigation.\nThe Authority sent 64 requests for international cooperation, the majority of which related to requests for background checks as part of an authorisation process. Furthermore, the Authority received a total of 36 requests for international collaboration from other regulators.\nUp to the end of June 2022, a total of 84 official replies were issued, providing feedback on the regulatory good standing of our licensed operators to the relevant authorities asking for this information.\nIn total, during the first six months of the year, the MGA received just over 100 requests for information from other local regulating authorities and governing bodies.\n\nThe MGA will publish a full-year industry performance report during the second half of 2023, when it publishes its Annual Report for the financial year ending 31 December 2022."

In this spirit, in recent years, the Maltese Government has launched a voluntary ESG reporting platform to encourage companies to publicly report on their ESG performance, thus driving investment towards sustainable businesses.\n\nWhile the Authority is proud of the consistent progress of the gaming sector and acknowledges the good work done by its licensees, some of which currently report on ESG publicly, starting from 2024, all large or listed companies will be required to report under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (‘CSRD’). In this context, in an effort to remain at the forefront of innovation and forward-looking practices, the MGA embarked on a journey to develop a voluntary code of good practice for the remote gaming sector to help guide and prepare local licensees for upcoming ESG legislation, and to potentially derive the benefits tied to running a sustainably conscious operation\n\nThe code will set out the common priorities for ESG in gaming, taking into consideration the needs of key stakeholders, to reduce environmental, social and governance impacts whilst continually enhancing Malta’s reputation as a leading Gaming jurisdiction.\n\nLooking ahead, we expect to see more and more companies taking concrete actions towards becoming more sustainable, and we believe that reporting such efforts contributes positively to implementing change within the sector and improving its overall perception, while also addressing the increasing demand for transparency and accountability in the industry.\n\nAs part of this initiative, the MGA has launched a survey with its licensees who are the key partners in the process of transforming the gaming sector into a more sustainable and transparent one.\n\nKindly reach out to the Authority at research.mga@mga.org.mt, if you have any queries."

The Authority is encouraging industry stakeholders to express their views and provide their feedback in relation to the Regulations and the Policy Document, so as to ensure that decisions are taken, and policies are adopted in a transparent and accountable manner.\n\nThe ongoing consultation shall give the opportunity to licensees to provide their feedback, if any, regarding the proposed amendments.

    "url": "https://www.mga.org.mt/gaming-parlours-licensed-lotteries-gaming-authority/",
    "html": "NEWS\n18 April 2012\nGaming Parlours Licensed by the Lotteries and Gaming Authority\n\nFollowing various reports in the media, the Lotteries and Gaming Authority (LGA) would like to clarify that only gaming parlours that are approved and granted a license by the LGA are allowed to operate gaming devices, albeit, under very strict conditions.\n\nTo date, the LGA issued 27 Gaming Parlour licenses, allowing such parlours to commence operations from 11am to 11pm. Such licenses were awarded following the coming into force of the Gaming Devices Regulations as on 16th of May 2011.\n\nIn order to be granted a license, an operator needs to pass through a very detailed licensing process, including the requirement to hold a valid MEPA development permit. The LGA would like to re-iterate what it stated in public in the past, that the mere fact that an operator holds a MEPA development permit does not result in an automatic granting of a gaming license. In fact, a number of applications have been refused on the grounds of non-compliance with the Regulations falling under the Lotteries and Other Games Act or the Location of Gaming Parlours Directive. In order for the LGA to grant a license (which is valid for 12 months), Gaming Parlours have to be at least 75 meters away from certain premises listed in the Directive, including schools, places of worship (such as Churches, Mosques, etc.) and playgrounds.\n\nFurthermore, throughout the licensing period, the licensees have to adhere to a number of requirements such as a minimum payout percentage to players of 85%, maximum bets and low maximum winnings and provide their customers detailed reports on the payout percentages of each machine, the money and time spent playing by the requesting player and the odds of the games.\n\nThe LGA would like to inform the general public that licensed gaming parlours are mandated to adhere to numerous player protection requirements, and adhere to social considerations as per law, such as the requirement to offer customers the option to self-exclude themselves for a period of either 6 or 12 months from all gaming establishments, including Casinos and Bingo Halls. Such high standards of player protection and regulatory supervision make a clear distinction between what is licensed today (in the public interest) as opposed to having illegal gaming devices in any establishment without any form of restrictions or direct supervision.\n\nA gaming parlour can easily be identified whether it is licensed by the LGA or not, as the operator is mandated to clearly display the LGA license certificate at their reception desk, players need to formally register to enter the gaming parlour, whilst each gaming device clearly tagged by the LGA and therefore easily identifiable from illegal devices.\n\nThe LGA insists that customers should make sure that they do not play on unauthorised gaming machines or modified computers in bars and other outlets as they may be prosecuted and if found guilty may be fined for up to €235,000 and imprisoned for up to 5 years. Such fines also apply to whoever makes available for use, hosts or operates such illegal gaming devices. The LGA calls on the public, NGO’s and Local Councils to assist the LGA in its enforcement efforts against illegal gaming by reporting such illegal activity.\n\nFor any inquires, please visit the LGA website http://www.lga.org.mt or contact the LGA on info@lga.org.mt."

Such collaboration shall augment even further, the existing deterrents and shall ensure that the possibility of achieving unfair winnings, (a phenomenon which is particularly present with respect to unregulated betting activities) remains shut out of the regulated markets, such as that regulated by the LGA.\n\nThe IOC – LGA MOU shall bring together the ISM’s early warning system, the LGA and its betting licensees to exchange betting-related information to assist the investigation of betting patterns or insider betting connected with the London Olympic Games. The MOU was signed by Mr Reuben Portanier, CEO of the Lotteries and Gaming Authority and Mr Detlev Zenglein of the International Sports Monitoring GmbH on behalf of the International Olympic Committee.\n\nThe MOU signed between the LGA and the International Olympic Committee is the LGA’s third MOU specifically targeted on Sport Integrity, thus enforcing LGA’s committed strategy and actions towards collaborating on sport integrity."

Dr Kimberley believes such collaboration initiatives will demonstrate that match-fixing through sport betting does not find fertile ground in thoroughly regulated jurisdictions such as Malta’s.\n\nMr Khalid Ali, the Secretary General of ESSA said “it’s in all our interests to defeat betting related match-fixing. By signing an MoU with the LGA in Malta we have a direct link with the Regulator to report any suspicious betting patterns thereby developing a robust eco-system to protect the interests of consumers, sport and the betting operators.”"

The amendments are aimed to strengthen and clarify the current player protection framework. This framework will support the Authority’s initiatives moving forward and shall facilitate the Authority’s plans to continuously improve the player protection framework, including the eventual publication of detailed player protection guidelines for Licensees. The Authority is in the process of conducting detailed research and garnering expert experience to serve as the foundation for the eventual publication of such guidelines.\n\nAs a first step, the amendments being proposed that are subject to the ongoing closed consultation delve into, inter alia, the licensees’ obligations regarding their responsible gaming policies and procedures and the introduction of five (5) markers of harm that must be considered by licensees when determining effective measures and processes to detect and address problem gambling. Provisions relating to real-money reinforcement and staff training have also been included in the proposed amendments.\n\nThe amendments are being proposed on the basis of a review of the key sections of the Directive carried out by an expert in the field, and on the basis of the Authority’s own research and experience garnered through the Responsible Gaming Unit’s audits and familiarisation visits.\n\nThe ongoing consultation shall give the opportunity to licensees to provide their feedback, if any, regarding the proposed amendments.

    "html": "NEWS\n21 April 2008\nBETFAIR WINS SECOND QUEEN’S AWARD FOR ENTERPRISE\n\nOnline betting company recognised for International Trade\n\nBETFAIR, the UK’s biggest online betting company, is proud to announce that it has won its second Queen’s Award for Enterprise in its eight year history.\n\nThe 2008 award comes in the International Trade category, five years after Betfair was recognised in the Innovation category for creating the first successful betting exchange – a new concept which meant a better deal for customers and greater protections within the betting industry.\n\nSince 2003, Betfair has grown substantially from a company with 100,000 users, of which only 8 percent were from outside the UK and Ireland, to a customer base in excess of one million where over 40 percent are international users.\n\nWinners of the Queen’s Award are selected on the recommendation of the Prime Minister and an independent advisory committee. Betfair joins a select group who have been honoured twice since the inception of the awards in 1966 and it means the company will be able to carry the Queen’s Award emblem for another five years.\n\nDavid Yu, Chief Executive of Betfair, said: “Upon winning our first award in 2003, our chairman and co-founder Edward Wray said that the company was looking forward to taking this great British innovation onto the global stage. Five years on, this award for International Trade is recognition of the strides we’ve made towards achieving that aim.”\n\n“Betfair continues to pride itself on its innovation, integrity, fairness to customers and a determination to work in partnership with international governments and regulators. Those qualities are being recognised throughout the world and we now have operational bases in Australia and Malta to support over one million registered customers.”\n\nWith this award, Betfair joins the likes of Rolls Royce, Weetabix, Aston Martin and James Dyson Ltd who have all been winners in the International Trade category in recent years.\n\nNotes to Editors:\n\nSince winning its first Queen’s award in 2003, Betfair has grown from 200 employees to over 1200 people in 2008, spread across its bases in Hammersmith, Stevenage, Malta and Australia. Driven by cutting-edge technology, Betfair enables customers to choose their own odds, even after an event has started. Betfair processes 5 million transactions a day, more than all of the European stock exchanges combined. Over half of all new customers now come from outside of the UK & Ireland.\n\nIn addition to the exchange, Betfair now has an established games portfolio. Betfair Poker, Betfair Games, Betfair Casino and Betfair’s accumulator products are hosted from Malta. It is an area that has seen significant growth and investment. The company is also developing new revenue streams by providing automated price feeds to third parties, establishing white-label exchanges and through its own Betfair Mobile product. In 2007, Betfair launched a new company, Tradefair, for those wishing to bet on financial markets.\n\nBetfair is a licensed betting operator in the UK, and also operates under licenses in Australia, Austria, Italy and Malta. The company is seeking licences elsewhere within the European Union and further afield. Betfair welcomes regulation and is committed to paying the appropriate product fees in every market in which it operates.\n\nWinners in the International Trade category for the Queen’s Award must demonstrate either “outstanding achievement… sustained over not less than three years, [or] continuous achievement in international trade, sustained over not less than six years”."

    "html": "NEWS\n2 June 2023\nThe MGA publishes its 2022 Annual Report and Financial Statements\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority (MGA/Authority) is publishing its Annual Report and audited Financial Statements for the financial year ending 31 December 2022. In addition to outlining the performance of the Maltese gaming business in 2022, the report gives a broad summary of the Authority’s accomplishments during the year under review and offers a medium-term outlook for the future. A thorough report outlining key statistics for the land-based and online gaming industries is then presented.\n\nSupervisory Activities\n\n28 compliance audits were conducted and 228 desktop reviews were carried out during 2022, accompanied by additional AML/CFT compliance examinations that are carried out by the FIAU, or by the MGA on its behalf. Following information which emerged from compliance audits, compliance reviews and formal investigations, the Authority issued 10 warnings and cancelled six (6) licences. In addition, the MGA issued a total of 16 administrative penalties as well as three (3) regulatory settlements, with a collective total financial penalty of €179,150.\nA total of 25 licensees were subject to remediation and/or administrative measures by the FIAU, ranging from written reprimands to administrative penalties, based on the breaches identified during examinations carried out in previous years, including by the MGA. In total, these amounted to just over €738,000.\nSix (6) individuals and companies were deemed by the Fit & Proper Committee to not be up to the Authority’s probity standards due to various factors, including due to the risks of money laundering or funding of terrorism.\nForty-one (41) gaming licence applications were received during 2022. Thirty-one (31) licences were issued, while twenty-one (21) were unsuccessful.\nOver 1,500 criminal probity screening checks were undertaken on individuals, shareholders and ultimate beneficial owners, key persons and other employees, and companies from both the land-based and online gaming sectors.\nThe Authority conducted 48 interviews with prospective MLROs and key persons carrying out the AML/CFT function to determine the knowledge and suitability of each candidate.\nThe Commercial Communication Committee of the MGA issued a total of nine (9) Letters of Breach following breaches of the Commercial Communications Regulations (S.L. 583.09).\nIn its efforts to protect players and encourage responsible gambling, the Authority supported a total of 5,280 players who requested assistance, covering most of the cases received during 2022 and the spill-over from 2021.\nThe MGA conducted 85 responsible gaming-themed website checks, through which 38 URLs were found to have misleading information. This led to 17 notices being published on the MGA website, and 30 observation letters that were sent out reflecting responsible gaming issues.\n\nImprovements in Efficiency and Effectiveness\n\nThe Authority commissioned a sectorial skills strategy to address the gaming industry’s challenges with respect to the ongoing demand for qualified and skilled human capital, which increased significantly as the economy grew and diversified into numerous sectors.\nConsultation exercises were conducted with industry stakeholders regarding the bets offered by licensees – with a focus on sports integrity and player protection considerations – on the proposed amendments to the Player Protection Directive (Directive 2 of 2018), and on the proposed policy on the use of Innovative Technology Arrangements (ITAs) and the acceptance of Virtual Financial Assets (VFAs) and Virtual Tokens, which led to amendments and a finalised Policy, respectively.\nThe Authority streamlined the approval process of appointing an MLRO in collaboration with the FIAU while, at the same time, ensuring that the industry is kept updated on any changes affecting this process and on any best practices that are intrinsic to the role of the MLRO.\nThe concept of Agreed-Upon Procedures (AUPs) Reports was introduced, covering player funds and Gaming Revenue. Audit firms are drawing up these reports in compliance with the ‘International Standard on Related Services (ISRS) 4400 (Revised) Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagements’.\nThe MGA kickstarted a process for possibly implementing a voluntary Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Code of Good Practice for the industry to showcase and increase the positive social and environmental impacts of the gambling sector.\n\nNational and International Cooperation\n\nThroughout 2022, the Authority issued 43 news items on its website and 26 external communications, providing a synopsis of various updates and developments at the Authority and across the industry.\nA total of 224 alerts were sent to the industry, 167 of which were also sent to the appropriate Sports Governing Bodies.\nA total of 44 requests for information specifically relating to the manipulation of sports competitions or breaches in sports rules were submitted by enforcement agencies, sport governing bodies, integrity units, and other regulatory bodies. As a result of such requests, data was exchanged in 25 instances. Additionally, a total of 475 suspicious betting reports from licensees and other concerned parties were received.\nDuring the period under review, the Authority was a direct participant in 15 different investigations across the globe relating to the manipulation of sports competitions or breaches in sports rules, as well as an indirect participant in 3 such investigations.\nThe Authority received a total of 83 international cooperation requests from other regulators and sent 97 such requests, with the majority referring to requests for background checks as part of an authorisation process.\nA total of 177 official replies were issued providing feedback on the regulatory good standing of our licensed operators to the relevant authorities asking for this information.\nThe MGA works together with other local regulating authorities and governing bodies. This is reflected through responses furnished by the MGA to requests for information made by the Asset Recovery Bureau (ARB), the FIAU, as well as the MPF on the gaming sector. Additionally, the relevant information is provided to the Sanctions Monitoring Board (SMB) to assist in issuing penalties in instances of non-compliance with sanctions screening obligations.\n\nIn publishing this report, the CEO, Dr Carl Brincat said: “This report is testament to our collective efforts in promoting a fair and sustainable gaming ecosystem. Through proactive measures and leaner regulation processes, we strive to ensure a level playing field that nurtures innovation while safeguarding against any potential risks.\n\n“As the global gaming landscape evolves, our role becomes even more critical. We embrace this responsibility with utmost determination, working tirelessly to stay ahead of emerging trends, technologies, and challenges.  We remain steadfast in our pursuit of robust frameworks that inspire confidence, protect vulnerable individuals and render Malta the home for gaming operators of good will.”"

    "html": "NEWS\n21 June 2023\nAmendments to the Gaming Act introduced through Bill 55\n\nParliament has approved amendments to the Gaming Act through Bill 55, enshrining into law the country’s existing public policy that protects the status of the Maltese gaming licence from unfounded challenges.\n\nEver since the establishment of the industry, the Maltese licence was devised as a point of supply licence. This enables licensees to operate cross-border from Malta, provided that a justifiable legal reason to provide their services to customers in such a jurisdiction exists, and always in compliance with the robust legal framework that is established under Maltese law and their licence conditions.\n\nThis ensures that consumers choose to engage and play within a regulated market, which is subject to strict legal obligations aimed at protecting players and which is overseen by a competent regulator that is empowered to take swift enforcement action in cases of non-compliance on the part of the licensee.\n\nThe scope of the amendments enacted into law is restricted, and the law does not preclude any action whatsoever from being taken against a licensee. The provisions shall only be applicable when the action – taken by an operator against a player, or a player against an operator – conflicts with or undermines the legality of the Maltese framework, and is related to activity which is lawful in terms of the Gaming Act and the other regulatory instruments applicable to the Malta Gaming Authority’s licensees.\n\nSimilarly, foreign judgments that fulfil the aforementioned criteria shall not be recognised and enforced in Malta, since the amendments are intended to clarify that such judgments are manifestly against the public policy (ordre public) of Malta."

    "html": "NEWS\n24 August 2023\nMGA addresses queries on ‘Bill 55’ following recent remarks in the media\n\nIn light of recent remarks being shared by sections of the media, the Malta Gaming Authority is taking the below opportunity to provide clarity, accuracy and transparency with regard to the recent amendments to the Gaming Act, commonly referred to as Bill 55.\n\nThe legislator’s intention behind the introduction of Article 56A is to enshrine into law the long-standing public policy of Malta in relation to the gaming sector.\n\nIt is important to note that the Maltese law does not create additional or separate grounds for refusing to recognise or enforce judgments to those already established under EU regulations (Regulation (EU) 1215/2012). It is simply an interpretation of the ordre public grounds for refusal envisaged in said EU regulation.\n\nMoreover, the scope of the amendments enacted into law is highly restricted, and the law does not preclude any action whatsoever from being taken against a licensee. Therefore, not every judgment relating to the operations of gaming operators with a Maltese licence would be in violation of Maltese public policy.\n\nArticle 56A sets out cumulative elements that must first be fulfilled before it can be triggered.\n\nThe provisions shall only be applicable when the action – taken by an operator against a player, or a player against an operator – conflicts with or undermines the legality of the Maltese framework, and is related to activity which is lawful in terms of the Gaming Act and the other regulatory instruments applicable to the Malta Gaming Authority’s licensees.\n\nThe Maltese gaming framework, in turn, is in full conformity with EU law and is based on the freedoms afforded to an entity established within the internal market."

The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is the first agreement between the MGA’s new Unit and a betting monitoring system and underlines the desire of both parties to tackle betting related corruption.\n\nKhalid Ali, CEO of the International Betting Integrity Association, said: “The creation of the Sports Integrity Unit and its focus on tackling match-fixing is a very welcome move, which is why I am delighted to have reached this agreement with the MGA that will allow us to work collaboratively on integrity. For its part, IBIA will utilise its unique global betting monitoring system, which includes many of the largest MGA licensed operators, to provide information on suspicious betting to the Unit with the aim of preventing sports betting related corruption.”\n\nAntonio Zerafa, the MGA’s Sports Integrity Officer, said: “The MGA has made the fight against the manipulation of sports competitions a core part of its licensing and regulatory policy. Working in partnership with other stakeholders, notably betting operators, is critical to the success of that approach and the MoU with IBIA is therefore of particular importance. IBIA and its members bring a wealth of market and consumer data that will undoubtedly serve to significantly strengthen the information and intelligence gathering ability of the Unit.”\n\nThe International Betting Integrity Association is the leading global voice on integrity for the licensed betting industry. It is run by operators for operators, protecting its members from corruption through collective action. Its monitoring and alert platform is a highly effective anti-corruption tool that detects and reports suspicious activity on its members’ betting markets.\n\nThe association has longstanding information sharing partnerships with leading sports and gambling regulators to utilise its data and prosecute corruption. It represents the sector at high-level policy discussion forums such as the IOC, UN, Council of Europe and European Commission.\n\nThe agreement comes into force as of 19 December 2019."

    "html": "SPORTS INTEGRITY UNIT\n6 April 2020\nMGA Notice on COVID-19 and Sports Integrity\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a disruptive impact on sports worldwide, and by correlation, the betting sector is facing unprecedented challenges. The Malta Gaming Authority understands that it is far from being business as usual for operators in this sector and is thus increasing industry outreach as means to set regulatory expectations in these turbulent times.\n\nMost sporting events have now come to a complete halt, and so have the betting markets. This will naturally spur interest in betting operators to look elsewhere, including betting on events with different risk profiles to those traditionally offered. This includes betting on sporting events which are not run to the same professional degree as the more traditional sporting events on which betting is normally offered, including but not limited to amateur or minor league sports.\n\nEsports is one such betting market which may see a significant boost during these times. Even traditional sports and their respective governing bodies have resorted to esports, with some already hosting simulated versions of their events digitally. Just like other sports, esports has varying levels of professional, semi-professional and amateur tournaments, and whilst many esports events are organised in a highly professional manner, others may not. And in a new sector such as esports, this distinction may not be easy to make.\n\nIn order to safeguard the integrity of such events, and warn betting operators of the risks involved, the Malta Gaming Authority is therefore recommending the following:\n\nOperators should consider that all esports events are now being run online, and therefore lacking the standard integrity checks done at events.\nOperators should ensure that matches are not pre-recorded, and risk teams should be aware that esports matches are not always broadcast in real time, and there is often a pre-set delay between the actual match, and the public broadcast.\nOperators should make sure that customers understand the distinction between esports, and virtual sports, whereby the outcome of the latter is determined by a random number generator.\nOperators should look into whether tournaments benefit from integrity controls, and whether participants are professional, or otherwise, when deciding on which betting markets to offer.\nOperators should seek information about the participants/officials involved in the esports events from communicative tournament organisers or from publicly available information.\nOperators should maintain their betting integrity and fraud checks including making sure that participants/officials involved in esports events are not placing bets.\nTournament organisers, broadcasters and sports governing bodies (SGBs) should revise any policies regarding misuse of inside information so as to include also any participants or officials involved in their esports events.\nAny suspicious betting activity should be reported to the gambling regulator.\nAny other suspicious activity (not betting related) pertinent to an esports event should be reported to the corresponding SGB, and/or event organiser."

It enables the MGA and the Malta FA to share not only crucial data but also expertise.”\n\nThe MGA’s Chief Executive Officer, Heathcliff Farrugia, emphasised the importance of this agreement, stating: “This Data Sharing Agreement follows a number of MoUs signed by the MGA with other regulatory bodies throughout 2019, and also ties in perfectly with MGA’s recent establishment of a dedicated Sports Integrity Unit.

These involvements will be created on the submission of the Change in Personal Details application.  This application will allow anyone with access rights to the Company Portfolio to approve or reject any involvement requests. The approval or rejection of the roles would signify the finalisation of the Company’s responsibilities, and henceforth, the MGA will be required to proceed with the final steps of the process.\n\nThe Authority has created tutorial videos in this regard, which can be accessed through the following link.

The amendment consists in the lowering of the existing minimum RTP percentage (applicable to operators offering their games online) from ninety-two per cent (92%) to eighty-five per cent (85%).\n\nThe MGA recognises that responsible decision-making necessitates the consideration of feedback provided by industry stakeholders and therefore, during May 2021 the Authority carried out a closed consultation to better assess the viability of the proposed change to the minimum RTP threshold. The consultation process involved a number of industry stakeholders, namely, consultants, Business-to-Consumer operators and Business-to-Business operators. The consultation process enabled the Authority to gain a better understanding of the views adopted by the consultation participants in terms of optimal RTP percentage and possible implications resulting from the change to the minimum RTP threshold on their product offering, operations, and competitive position. In addition, the MGA also carried out a comparative analysis on the applicability of the RTP percentages that one may find in selected jurisdictions throughout the European Union (‘EU’) and outside of the EU. A summary of the outcome of the consultation as well as the research carried out by the MGA can be found in the attached Policy Paper on the Amending the Return to Player Minimum Percentage, which is being published in parallel with the amendments to the Directive.\n\nIn line with its commitment to protect consumers, especially minors and vulnerable persons, the MGA shall be publishing further amendments to the Directive in due course.\n\nAll licensees are reminded that the game rules must be readily available to the player. Those offering the service online must ensure that the game rules are to be displayed in full no more than one click away from the page on which the game can be played. With respect to games which are played after being downloaded and installed on a compatible device, licensees shall also ensure that the game rules shall be made present to the player in any case prior to the player’s first wager on the game. For the avoidance of any doubt, this requirement is equally applicable to mobile sites and to mobile device applications."

The Authority is also issuing a new System Review Checklist, which will be used after licence issuance, to verify that the implemented systems operated by the Licensee reflect the information submitted to the Authority, as well as being in line with the requirements emanating from the Gaming Act and any other relevant subsidiary legislations. Both documents may be accessed from the ‘Downloads’ section.\n\nThe revised Audit Checklist builds on the previous version, however, it also takes into consideration the requirements from the revised System Documentation Checklist, and omits any requirements that were inefficient or obsolete. The Audit Checklist has been split into 4 separate checklists to cater for the differing B2C, B2C with DLT, B2B and B2B Software needs.\n\nAlthough applicants are urged to refer to the revised Audit Checklist where possible, the revised requirements will come into force for any System Audits engaged as of 1 January 2023.\n\nSystem Reviews will also be carried out by the approved Audit Service Providers (the ‘ASPs’), similar to the System and Compliance Audits processes. The System Review should be carried out on the live environment, and the Licensee’s personnel should be available to demonstrate functionality and provide evidence and information as per the list of checks provided.\n\nSystem Reviews will generally be required one year after issuance of a new licence, or within a shorter time frame if a system audit was not required at licence issuance stage. A Licensee might be asked to undergo a System Review in any other instances that the Authority decides upon.\n\nAudit Service Providers conducting System Audit and/or System Reviews should submit feedback though the Authority’s CRM system, or otherwise, as instructed by the Authority. The checklists have been structured in a way to better guide ASPs and Licensees on the checks applicable per licence type. However, the ASP is free to conduct and include feedback on other additional checks that are deemed relevant to the Audit. This is especially so in the cases of B2B licence providers offering both management and/or control of the games, as well as that of the back-end software. In such instances, the different checks from both B2B tabs might be relevant and would need to be conducted.\n\nIn case of any checks which are deemed to be as not applicable, the ASP needs to provide the rationale behind this decision, as well as any supporting evidence.\n\nKindly contact our support team at help.mga@mga.org.mt should you require any further information."

Provisions relating to real-money reinforcement and staff training have also been addressed via the amendments.\n\nThe amendments are being proposed on the basis of a review of the key sections of the Directive carried out by an expert in the field, and on the basis of the Authority’s own research and experience garnered through the Responsible Gaming Unit’s audits and familiarisation visits.\n\nSubject to the transitory provisions of the Directive, the amendments shall come into force on 12 January 2023."

    "html": "NEWS\n14 July 2006\nSpeech by the Hon. Tonio Fenech, Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Finance, on the occasion of the Open-Day held for the recruitment of personnel in the i-gaming industry.\n\nI am delighted to be opening this career opportunities event for the i-gaming industry. My virtual presence works out with an industry that is entirely based on means of distance communications!\n\nIt gives me great satisfaction to see such an event being organized by the private industry for this business sector. It demonstrates that our government’s long term strategy has been successful and now its bearing fruit, Eight years ago we felt that Malta should become a centre of excellence for Information Technology and embarked on a project to identify which industries would best suit our economy, size and infrastructure. It was not an easy task remembering that this was in the time of the so called ‘dot-com boom’ crash. However as international markets continued to fall it became clear that e-commerce was a realistic economy that could develop into global proportions. Malta chose to take up Remote gaming as it fledgling on-line market, but with strong players who had experience of the same business in the real world.\n\nGovernment’s objectives to attract such operators to Malta were not simply to generate direct revenues from taxation. As part of its ICT strategy, government wanted Malta’s IT infrastructure to grow bringing job opportunities for young Maltese people who were being encouraged to take up high-value careers. For this we invested more in our education system at post secondary level to include specialty ICT courses at MCAST and University, whilst at the same time embarking on a strategy introduce IT at all levels of our education system.\n\nCombined with other initiatives, our aim is to make Malta a center of excellence in ICT which in itself will helps to attract international operators who are either directly user of ICT, or require support services as part of their business function.\n\nThe Remote Gaming industry in Malta is a prime example of ICT direct users. This industry requires leading edge e-commerce technologies and resources. The fact that operators continue to invest in Malta as part of their growth strategy demonstrated that the island has scaled well with the exigencies of the industry both in terms of availability of infrastructure and skilled human resources.\n\nThe key success factors for Malta’s remote gaming industry can be summed up in three words: Responsible, Responsive and Reliable. Malta took a bold step from the out-set to introduce remote gaming regulations that were far superior than any other jurisdiction in terms of strict licensing procedures, strong monitoring controls and player protection mechanism. We did not want Malta to become a nation of convenience for unscrupulous operators. In the long term this decision paid well since as the industry grew, operators realized that their success was dependent on their regulatory jurisdiction’s reputation a serious regulator.\n\nHaving good regulations is not good enough unless you have somebody to enforce it. This is why the lotteries and gaming authorities invested in human resources and technologies to be able to carry out its duties as the regulatory body on remote gaming. Being receptive to the exigencies of the operators and players is demonstrates a high level of commitment from the Regulator and which is expected in such a high-risk industry.\n\nWith over 160 applications for a remote gaming license of which 90 having already established their business, its clear that this industry is here to stay.\n\nToday there already over 600 people working locally with remote gaming operators and many more in the supporting services industry. As more operators establish here, more human resources will be required and this is why we regarding this event as important. It gives an opportunity to the public to see what i-gaming can offer as a career in its diverse functions."

The report provides a review of the Authority’s accomplishments for the first half of 2023, together with a description of the Maltese gaming industry’s performance over the same period. The latter provides a medium-term outlook towards the future, as well as an analysis outlining important statistics for the land-based and online gaming industries.\n\nSupervisory Activities\nBetween January and June 2023, the Authority conducted 14 compliance audits, and 85 desktop reviews. The Commercial Communications Committee also issued a total of three Letters of Breach, whereby operators were found to be in breach of the Gaming Commercial Communications Regulations (S.L. 583.09). The Authority issued 23 warnings, cancelled four licences, and suspended another five, following information which emerged from supervisory activities. Furthermore, the MGA issued a total of nine administrative penalties as well as one regulatory settlement, with a collective total financial penalty of €124,400.\nThe MGA also carried out 11 Compliance Examinations on behalf of the FIAU. During the same period, the FIAU imposed administrative penalties on three licensees based on violations discovered during examinations carried out in previous years. In total, these amounted to €599,420.\nA total of 545 criminal probity screening checks were undertaken on personnel, shareholders, ultimate beneficial owners, key individuals, employees, and businesses from the land-based and online gaming sectors. A number of these were escalated to the Fit & Proper Committee, which during the period in review determined that four individuals and entities did not meet the Authority’s fit and properness criteria. The Supervisory Council also rejected one licence application on the same basis.\nIn the first half of the year, 19 interviews with prospective MLROs and key persons carrying out the AML/CFT function were carried out with the aim of determining the knowledge and suitability of each candidate.\nIn its efforts to safeguard players and promote responsible gaming, the Authority assisted a total of 2,216 players who requested assistance, covering the majority of the cases received during 2023 and the spillover from 2022. Furthermore, 40 responsible gambling website checks were conducted to ensure that licensees are duly protecting their players as required by law, and 16 observation letters were issued identifying areas of improvement.\nA total of 11 cases of websites having misleading references to the Authority were investigated, while a total of six notices were published on the MGA’s website with the aim of preventing the public from falling victim to such scams.\nNational and International Cooperation\nEnforcement agencies, sports governing bodies, integrity units, and other regulatory authorities made a total of 12 requests for information, specifically in relation to the manipulation of sporting events or violations of sporting regulations. Subsequently, these requests resulted in 17 data exchanges. In addition, 166 allegations of suspicious betting from licensees and other interested parties were received.\nBetween January and June 2023, a total of 118 alerts on suspicious betting were sent to the industry. Following further correspondence of these alerts to the industry, the Authority received a total of 12 new suspicious betting reports through the Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism.\nThe Authority participated directly in six separate investigations into sports rules violations or manipulation of sporting competitions during the time under review. A direct investigation implies that the report came from MGA licensed operators, and thus betting data was shared. In addition, the Authority also participated indirectly in another five investigations, where the events reported formed part of another jurisdiction, but concerned Maltese players.\nThe Authority sent 23 requests for international cooperation, relating to requests for background checks as part of an authorisation process. Furthermore, the Authority received a total of 37 requests for international collaboration from other regulators.\nBy the end of June 2023, a further 53 official replies were issued, providing feedback on the regulatory good standing of our licensed operators to the relevant authorities asking for this information.\nIn total, during the first six months of the year, the MGA received 45 requests for information from other local regulating authorities and governing bodies.\n\nThe MGA will publish a full-year industry performance report during the second half of 2024, when it publishes its Annual Report for the financial year ending 31 December 2023."

    "html": "NEWS\n13 October 2005\nThe Malta Lotteries and Gaming Authority publishes the public consultation amendments to Remote Gaming Regulations of 2004\n\nToday the Malta Lotteries and Gaming Authority has published for public consultation amendments to Remote Gaming Regulations of 2004. The reason for this regulatory update is to bring Maltese regulations at par with current industry practices.\n\n“We have always assured our licensees that the Maltese regulatory regime on remote gaming will reflect the exigencies of the industry. The update maps out our response to the ever changing landscape of the remote gaming business” says Mario Galea, CEO of The Lotteries and Gaming Authority. The fact that the original version of the regulation was just published in May 2004, but since then the industry has seen a number of changes especially in the poker and skill games markets and a new breed of business models which change the methods of interaction between licensees and service providers. The aim of the update is to broaden further the concept of game neutral and technology neutral licensing and to facilitate more the uptake of regulated intermediaries. The regulations also introduce some new concepts, such as the recognition and approval of organisations that can offer on-line support to compulsive players. Organisations that can aid compulsive on-line players are now a reality and the Authority wants to actively ensure that licensees in Malta will be able to offer reliable assistance to their players. The Authority will co-ordinate a system that allows compulsive players to bar themselves from all operators in Malta for a specified period of time.\n\nThe LGA has commissioned the Malta Remote Gaming Council for the management of the public consultation process. “We want the MRGC to lead the consultation process to stress the point that the regulatory update reflects the needs of the industry.” says Dr. Zammit Maempel, Chairman of the LGA. The Council was set up in March 2005 as a trade group involving licensees and local service providers in the remote gaming industry.\n\nA copy of the amended Remote Gaming Regulations can be downloaded from the LGA website, www.lga.org.mt. The public consultation period ends November 16th 2005.\n\nThe Remote Gaming Regulations were published in May 2004 and since then have attracted a number of operators to Malta. Projections show that by the end of 2005, Malta will have over 100 licensed operators in various classes of remote gaming.\n\nEUROPEANCEO INTERVIEWS LOTTERIES AND GAMING AUTHORITY CHIEF EXECUTIVE\n\nThe latest issue of the influential International Magazine, EuropeanCEO carried an interview with the Lotteries and Gaming Authority Chief Executive, Mr Mario Galea.\n\nThe special issue included a survey of the on-line gaming market in which Malta was featured as a reputable jurisdiction that regulates this industry.\n\nThe publication which is targeted to top level management and decision making executives with a circulation of more than 45,000 copies, outlined Malta’s involvement in this particular industry and its importance within the European dimension.\n\nThe article also outlines the phenomenal growth of the Maltese jurisdiction during the past year and mentions the overwhelming response of remote gaming operators to be licensed in Malta.\n\nThe report focused on the ability of the Lotteries and Gaming Authority in transcending the regulatory limitations of brick and mortar gaming, and transforming them to high-tech media.\n\nThe article stresses that as an EU member state, Malta has harmonised regulations and services with the rest of the other member states, however the island remains the only one with a complete regulatory regime for on-line gaming.\n\nFurthermore, the feature portrays the regulations as pragmatic which focus on the importance of player protection and the promotion of responsible gaming."

The LGA will continue to use its own methodologies in conducting due diligence investigations on all applicants to decide on their suitability as licensees and to review other appropriate areas addressing player protection and responsible operator conduct.\n\nThe discussions follow investigations by the LGA in a search for optimum testing and operational systems. Malta is a full member of the European Union.\n\nThe agreement will potentially apply to a wide range of online casinos and poker rooms, comprising a significant proportion of the available business. Malta numbers 71 online gambling sites as licensees, and there are 76 major Internet venues carrying the eCOGRA “Play It Safe” seal.\n\nThere will also be more cooperation between the two bodies on player disputes to ensure that these are heard fairly, independently and within a reasonable timeframe. The LGA has its own compliance and disputes officer and eCOGRA offers a dedicated dispute mediation service through its Fair Gaming Advocate.\n\nFurther discussions will now detail the finer points of cooperation and consistency between the requirements of the two bodies, based on an acceptance of common principles of honesty and efficiency in the interests of player protection.\n\nMario Galeo, the chief executive responsible for Malta licensing says that he is pleased with the agreement reached with eCOGRA and looks forward to close cooperation and communication in the interest of creating better conditions in the online gambling industry.\n\n“We share a common purpose in seeking to ensure that the player is given fair gaming and efficient, courteous service by casinos and poker rooms that are licensed and regulated by our respective bodies,” he said. “We look forward to a closer working relationship that benefits both the players and the industry in the years ahead.”\n\nThe CEO of eCOGRA, Andrew Beveridge said he was delighted that the LGA had approved the testing procedures and operating standards that his organisation had introduced for the “Play It Safe” seal operations.\n\n“eCOGRA is keen to interact with any jurisdiction that shares our values and we regard this closer relationship with the LGA as a significant step toward consistent global regulation for safe online gambling,” he said.\n\nThe agreement follows a similar collaborative arrangement with the Kahnawake licensing jurisdiction in Canada, which was signed late last year by the directors of the Kahnawake Gaming Commission and eCOGRA.\n\neCOGRA has announced that the growing interaction between major regulatory and standards authorities is broadly aimed at achieving wider consistency across geographical borders in regard to requirements and standards concerning online casino and poker room relations with the player community.\n\nAbout eCOGRA\n\neCOGRA, the independent standards authority for the online gaming industry, is committed to protecting online casino and poker players around the world. The non-profit organization addresses the most important issues to players: fast payouts, fair gaming, responsive and efficient service and responsible operator conduct.\n\neCOGRA provides an international framework of best operational and player practice requirements enforced through inspections, reviews, and continuous monitoring by independent global audit companies. To date, 76 sites comply with these requirements and have been awarded the coveted “Play It Safe” Seal that identifies to players the safest online gaming sites on the Web.

    "html": "NEWS\n26 October 2023\nCancellation of Authorisation for Arabmillionaire Limited (C 81104)\n\nWith reference to the Notice of Cancellation (the ‘Notice’) dated 04 August 2022 issued by the Malta Gaming Authority (the ‘Authority’), Arabmillionaire Limited (the ‘Authorised Person’) was provided with a twenty-day time period within which it had the right to show cause as to why the Authority should not proceed with the enforcement measure highlighted by said Notice in accordance with reg. 10 (2) (a) of the Gaming Compliance and Enforcement Regulations (S.L. 583.06) (the ‘Regulations’).\n\nPursuant to the issuance of the Notice, the Authorised Person and its consultants duly informed the Authority that the former was undergoing a major re-structuring exercise and requested, inter alia, to ‘freeze’ the license for the company to finalise and settle all outstanding issues.\n\nPursuant to the above submissions, and despite the numerous breaches constituting grounds for cancellation of the authorisation, the Authority opted to suspend the Authorised Person’s licence on 12 October 2022 in order to provide the latter with an opportunity to rectify its standing with the Authority.\n\nBy virtue of the Suspension, the Authorised Person was clearly informed that the Authority shall proceed to cancel the licence should it fail to remedy its breaches, settle all its outstanding payments to both the Authority and to all its registered players, and provide full assurance that it is in a position to hold the authorisation granted to it and to operate under its terms. It should be noted that the Authorised Person did not appeal the Authority’s decision to suspend the licence.\n\nDespite being granted ample time to address the breaches mentioned above, the Authorised Person has failed to both rectify its position and cooperate with the Authority. All attempts to communicate with the Authorised Person following November 2022 have been rendered futile. The breaches have continued to persist to date.\n\nIn addition to the payment of the outstanding licence fee outlined within the Notice, the Authorised Person’s licence fee for the year 2023 fell due on 13 June 2023 during the Suspension’s operative period. Hence, an additional twenty-five thousand Euro (€25,000) is considered due to the Authority in this regard. Therefore, the Authorised Person owes the Authority fifty-thousand Euros (€50,000) in annual licence fees for the licence periods commencing on 13 June 2022 and 13 June 2023, respectively.\n\nPursuant to the above, the Authority is hereby notifying the Authorised Person that the Authorisation bearing the number ‘MGA/ B2C/425/2017’ (the ‘Authorisation’) is hereby being cancelled in terms of the Regulations. The foregoing decision has been taken pursuant to the grounds mentioned in the aforementioned Notice.\n\nFurther to the above considerations, the Authorised Person is hereby being directed to:\n\nDuly notify the players, if any, of the cancellation of the Authorisation. Such notification should be effected by means of the Authorised Person’s website/s, as well as via electronic mail.\n\nMoreover, such notification shall include, but shall not be limited to, the manner in which such registered players are to withdraw any funds held by the Authorised Person on their behalf; \n\nProvide the necessary guidance and assistance to the players in relation to the procedures that shall be applied by the Authorised Person further to the remittal of outstanding player balances;\n\nFurther to sections 1 and 2 above, the Authorised Person shall:\n\na. Where players make a request for the withdrawal of their outstanding balances, endeavour to remit all player funds standing to the credit of such players by not later than five (5) working days from the date upon which a player makes a request to this effect;\n\nProvided that where the players fail to make such request, the Authorised Person shall endeavour to remit all player funds standing to the credit of every player.\n\nProvided further that where possible, outstanding player balances are to be remitted to the same account from which the funds originated.\n\nb. Follow the procedures laid out in the Gaming Authorisations and Compliance Directive (Directive 3 of 2018) with respect to inactive and dormant accounts, including but not limited to, the remittal of outstanding balances to the Authority, where applicable; and\n\nc. Ensure that all pending player disputes are duly settled.\n\nThe Authority hereby advises you that in terms of sub-article (f) and (g) of the Third Schedule to the Gaming Act (Cap. 583 of the Laws of Malta) (the ‘Act’), the failure to effect payments to players when lawfully due, and failing to ensure the integrity and availability of essential regulatory data, are considered offences against the Act, and hence, classified as a criminal offences.\n\nAdditionally, as a director of the Authorised Person, you may be subjected to criminal proceedings and shall be held liable in solidum with the Authorised Person in accordance with article 23 (1) of the Act.\n\nProcess personal data in accordance with its privacy policy and with any applicable data protection legislation. The Authorised Person shall also bring to the players’ attention, the manner in which it shall process all player data further to the termination of the Authorisation;\n\nSubmit to the Authority a transaction report extracted from their back-end system together with the supporting bank statements, attesting that all player funds have been duly remitted to the registered players;\n\nProvided that the Authority shall reserve the right to request the Authorised Person to provide the necessary facilities to the Authority in order for the latter to extract and make copies of the relevant data, including but not limited to, essential regulatory data as defined in the Gaming Definitions Regulations (S.L. 583.04); and\n\nSettle all outstanding fees that are due to the Authority, amounting to a total of fifty thousand Euro (€50,000.00), within a period of five (5) working days from the date of receipt of this letter.\n\nWithout prejudice to the conditions that must be adhered to by the Authorised Person with immediate effect and any other deadline referred to above, the Authorised Person shall comply with the above listed actions by not later than seven (7) days from the date of receipt of this letter, unless indicated otherwise in the above sections.\n\nIn terms of Article 43 (1) of the Act, if the Authorised Person feels aggrieved by the decision of the Authority, such person shall have the right to file an appeal before the Administrative Review Tribunal within twenty (20) days from the date of publication of this cancellation.\n\nThe Authority reserves the right to take any other measures pertinent to it at law in order to recover the outstanding dues to it from the Authorised Person should the latter fail to\nrectify accordingly, and should the latter fail to settle all outstanding claims from its registered players.\n\nThe Authorised Person shall remain liable for all applicable obligations emanating from the Act and any other applicable regulatory instrument.\n\nThis publication is being made in accordance with the first proviso of regulation 12 of the Regulations."

    "url": "https://www.mga.org.mt/mga-publishes-voluntary-esg-code-of-good-practice/",
    "html": "NEWS\n8 November 2023\nMGA publishes voluntary ESG Code of Good Practice\n\nIn a landmark moment for the Maltese gaming sector, the Malta Gaming Authority has proudly introduced the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Code of Good Practice for the remote gaming sector.\n\nThis ESG Code seeks to serve as an instrument for self-regulation, helping remote gaming companies align with best practices and maintain a position that allows them to effectively meet the evolving expectations of key stakeholders in the sector.\n\nWhile this ESG Code is voluntary, all MGA licensees are strongly encouraged to adopt it to better demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and to continue improving the ESG standing of the industry.\n\nAddressing a press conference, MGA CEO Carl Brincat said that across industries, a trend has emerged towards greater transparency, disclosure, accountability and active engagement in addressing the pressing social and environmental issues of our time.\n\n“The MGA has always strived to be at the forefront of regulatory innovation and progress. We have been working not only to supervise the gaming industry, but also to nurture it, to foster a space where operators can thrive, while ensuring that the welfare of society remains paramount. Our ESG Code represents our commitment to this,” Dr Brincat said.\n\nMGA CEO Carl Brincat\nEconomy Minister Silvio Schembri\nPolicy and International Affairs Chief Kinga Warda\n\nMinister for the Economy, EU Funds and Lands Silvio Schembri said that the aim of the press conference was to highlight the importance for the remote gaming sector to voluntarily use the ESG tool that is increasingly shaping the business and investment landscape, as well as our approach to social and environmental challenges.\n\n“All businesses should embrace tools to reduce risk and transform successfully, and when it comes to remote gaming, one of the tools is using ESG metrics.\n\n“The ESG code will serve as an instrument for self-regulation, helping remote gaming companies align with best practices and maintain a position that allows them to effectively meet the evolving expectations of key stakeholders in the sector,” Minister Schembri said.\n\nThe ESG Code, unveiled today, is the culmination of a journey that involved four extensive stages: the peer review and research phase, materiality assessment, stakeholder interviews and licensees’ consultations. This extensive process has resulted in a final Code that is well-informed and reflective of the industry’s ESG priorities and stakeholder expectations.\n\nKey Features of the ESG Code – a Balanced Approach\n\nThe Code identifies 19 ESG topics, derived from the materially assessment, organised into three categories: Environmental, Social and Governance, providing a strategic framework for remote gaming companies to focus their reporting efforts effectively.\n\nTwo Tiers of Reporting: The MGA will recognise companies’ efforts with two levels of reporting, Tier 1, a basic ESG standard, and Tier 2, a more aspirational level, to ensure sustainability efforts are focused and impactful.\nFlexible approach for certain disclosures: Core disclosures have been defined, while reporting entities will have the flexibility to choose optional disclosures;\nStreamlined Reporting: The Code includes several ESG disclosures already required under existing reporting frameworks to streamline reporting and reduce administrative burden; and\nFocus on ESG reporting: The emphasis is on ESG reporting, rather than setting specific ESG targets.\nAn MGA ESG Code Approval Seal\n\nIndustry consultation revealed a strong desire for formal recognition by the MGA. To meet this demand, the MGA ESG Code Approval Seal will be awarded to entities that report under this Code, showcasing their commitment to ESG. Different seals will be awarded to entities that meet Tier 1 or Tier 2 reporting requirements.\n\nHow the ESG Code will Work in Practice\n\nThe Code will be a standalone voluntary submission, separate from other ESG disclosures made by the reporting entity to the MGA or other bodies. Reporting will be confidential, and the MGA will launch an online tool to facilitate the process. Additionally, the ESG Code will align reporting periods with the financial year of reporting entities. The inaugural reporting year will commence in 2023, with the submission deadline set for the third quarter of 2024.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe MGA’s ESG Code of Good Practice is a crucial step in advancing the sustainability and responsibility of the remote gaming industry in Malta. This achievement represents a significant milestone in our journey, and we are enthusiastic about the positive impact it will have on the gaming industry and our stakeholders.\n\nAlongside the Code, we are also publishing a Consultation feedback document that highlights the comprehensive feedback received from our licensees during the development of the ESG framework.\n\nClick here to access the full ESG Code of Good Practice.\n\nClick here to access the Consultation feedback document."

    "html": "ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING UPDATES\n3 March 2022\nNotice on the intensifying state of affairs between Russia and Ukraine\n\nWith reference to the intensifying state of affairs between Russia and Ukraine, the Malta Gaming Authority (“the Authority”) would like to remind its licensees of their sanctions monitoring obligations under article 17(6) of the National Interest (Enabling Powers) Act and any guidance/directions issued by the Sanctions Monitoring Board (“SMB”). Licensees are particularly reminded of their obligation to carry out sanctions screening prior to the onset of a business relationship and thereafter on a risk-sensitive basis. The issue of new or updated sanctions should be considered as a triggering event to run fresh checks on one’s customers. Furthermore, licensees are also reminded of their obligation to stop any transaction from going through, freeze any assets and inform the SMB of any customers matching with the applicable sanctions lists.\n\nMoreover, the Authority is stressing the importance that licensees ensure:\n\nThat any systems used to monitor sanctions are being run in an effective and efficient manner;\nThat they are informed with any updates regarding the Russia/Ukraine situation and, as a result, calibrate their sanctions monitoring systems in order to reflect any additions made to the applicable lists being monitored; and\nThat they react swiftly in ensuring that their customer databases are subject to the most recently updated and applicable sanctions lists.\n\nLicensees are reminded to continuously keep up-to-date with any sanctions that may be imposed and with any guidance, notices, decisions, recommendations, or rulings that may be issued by the SMB by visiting the SMB’s website (https://foreignandeu.gov.mt/en/Government/SMB/Pages/SMB-Home.aspx) and by subscribing to the SMB’s notification updates. To subscribe to the SMB notifications on the latest UN/EU/National sanctions, please send an email to sanctions.mfea@gov.mt.\n\nLicensees are also being reminded of any AML/CFT related obligations, particularly in terms of geographical risks posed to licensees by the geographical location of the business/economic activity and the source of wealth/funds of their customers. Within this context, licensees are reminded that international financial sanctions need to be considered within their customer risk assessments.\n\nFor more information in this respect, reference should be made to the Guidance Note published by the FIAU."

    "html": "SPORTS INTEGRITY UNIT\n28 May 2020\nThe Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Gaming Industry in Malta\n\nIn April 2020, the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), conducted a survey among its licensed online operators to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the gaming sector through its Information & Research unit. The survey covered a number of different areas, including impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Gaming Revenue (GR) or revenue, operating costs and investments. It also focused on the industry concerns and actions taken by operators during this pandemic.\n\nThe results show that the worst hit sector is projected to be the B2C sector, in particular the operators exposed to Type 2 game types. Indeed, the GR for this sector is projected to be 40% lower than that projected in earlier budgets for the same full year 2020. Most of the operators are considering postponing investment plans for a later date, subject to a notable degree of uncertainty. The key highlights from this survey are presented below.\n\nThe MGA will continue following closely the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and further surveys aimed as assessing other impacts will also be conducted."

Sharing best practice and exchange of information is key in the fight against match-fixing.”\n\nThis agreement will facilitate the sharing of information between the two parties, in fulfilment of the requirements at law."

In this regard, the Authority’s Sports Betting Integrity department continuously seeks ways of improving monitoring and reporting capabilities across the wider Maltese sports betting sector. In that light, the Authority’s Sports Betting Integrity department has the below updates to share.\n\nOn 1 October 2021, the Authority implemented the following changes:\n\nUpdating of the Suspicious Betting Reporting Requirements\n\nThe Authority has revised the Suspicious Betting Reporting Requirements and commencing from 1 October 2021 the requirements now include licensees that offer a critical gaming supply relating to betting on sports events. This means that now, both licensees that offer a gaming service and/or a critical gaming supply relating to betting on sports events must notify the Authority of any instance relating to suspicious betting.\nSuspicious Betting Alerting Process\nThe Sports Betting Integrity department started alerting its licensees with any knowledge of suspicious betting activity in its possession. Without revealing the source of the information, the Authority started informing its licensees of any instances of suspicious betting activity in relation to any event that has been adverted by such.\n\nHow does this new alerting process help the Operator?\n\nEnsures that MGA licensed operators are aware of suspicious betting activities known within the MGA’s radar.\nAllows MGA licensed operators to review their own monitoring systems and verify that they have not been subject to similar activities.\nIncreases awareness of suspicious betting risks being faced across the Maltese betting sector.\n\nHow does this new alerting process help the Authority?\n\nBetter and wider monitoring of suspicious betting activity taking place within the Maltese betting sector.\nHolistic review and evaluation of the sports betting risks faced by the sector at large.\nAllows for a more informed Maltese betting sector, further bridging together the Authority and its licensees in their collective fight against corruption in sports and sports betting.\n\nThe Authority’s Sports Betting Integrity department reminds all interested parties to continuously refer to the Guidance Paper on the Suspicious Betting Reporting Requirements & Other Sports Integrity Matters for direction on all matters relating to the Authority’s sports integrity endeavours and the roles and responsibilities of its licensees.\n\nThe Authority also welcomes all who are interested to know more about the department’s role in safeguarding the integrity of sports and sports betting to contact them via email."

Personally, I regard this as a milestone as I believe that such platforms have a lot of information that they can bring to the table to help prevent and investigate such crimes.”\n\nThe conference was held on the 19th of October in Strasbourg.\n\nPhoto credit: Council of Europe\n\n \n\n "

    "html": "ARTICLES\n21 May 2015\nFuture Proof | Interview with MGA’s Executive Chairman, Joseph Cuschieri\n\nThe MGA is taking a fresh look at what we have been doing over the last decade, to future-proof the organisation for the next ten years.\n\nQ: Could you give us an overview of Malta as a gaming jurisdiction and the main trends that have influenced the sector over the last few years?\n\nMalta was the first European country to have a body of legislation regulating online gaming. This was a kind of evolution of financial services, given the fiscal incentives we had in the financial services regime, and gaming companies started to set up here to benefit from them. As Malta continued to attract increasing numbers of companies, the authorities recognised that an opportunity existed to provide a regulated environment for the growing industry. In 2004, Malta was the first EU member state to launch remote gaming regulations, establishing a new regulatory framework that offered operators a pan-European online gaming licence. Malta’s developed ICT infrastructure, coupled with our high standards of regulatory policy and education, our skills, English-speaking population, political stability, as well as EU membership, were all critical success factors.\n\nMalta has a reputation for being one of the most tried and tested jurisdictions in the world, and this reputation has served us well for all these years. Now, 11 years down the line, it’s clear that what brought us here will not take us there. We can’t use the same approach going forward as the landscape has changed drastically. To stay ahead of the game, we are in the process of overhauling the iGaming regulations. It is an intensely competitive market and the dynamics have changed with the concept of national authorisations – a move accepted by the European Commission. We are also taking a fresh look at how to future-proof the MGA for the next ten years and cater for new technology and games, as well as changing consumer needs. Key benefits of Malta are its beneficial fiscal regime, pro-business government and its complete ecosystem that supports the entire gaming industry. Additional services to the gaming industry are provided by professionals in other sectors, such as lawyers, accountants and ICT service providers.\n\nThe fact that Malta is English speaking across the board is a big asset as is our excellent education system that provides the necessary skills-set for the industry. Gaming has also created a big expat community in Malta, which is a sign of success – Malta is a safe place to live, with the added bonus of a great climate and relaxed Mediterranean lifestyle. We have a good business portfolio, with 270 companies and over 460 active licences. We are in the process of transforming the MGA into a regulatory organisation with an entrepreneurial spirit, instilling a more private-sector mindset with more agility, professionalism and efficiency. We are inspecting all areas within the authority – research, IT infrastructure, business intelligence, automation, intelligence tools – and creating a channel to consult and communicate with operators and players, publish consultation documents to get a reaction from the industry, and build our know-how to raise the quality of our decision-making. The MGA is also hiring fresh talent and investing more in training. Our aim is to have a stronger physical and online presence.\n\nQ: What new initiatives is the MGA working on?\n\nWe are working to create a complete gaming ecosystem and have recently rebranded the entire organisation. One of the major changes will be the overhaul of the regulatory framework. We have also launched GamingMalta, which is the promotional body for the gaming industry, and are working on the knowledge development aspect, by launching the Gaming Academy in 2015. These two initiatives will add significant value to the Malta licence. We are strengthening our position as Europe’s top gaming jurisdiction and placing strong focus on enhancing consumer protection.\n\nQ: How are you developing the regulation side of things at the MGA?\n\nOur vision is to be the top regulator in the world when it comes to remote gaming. We’ve had that pole position before, and we want it again. Over the years, we’ve lost some of that edge with other jurisdictions coming onto the scene and our model has been copied nicely. However, imitation is the best form of flattery. Today, our key priority is to ensure we have a regulatory framework in place that incentivises innovation in the industry, enables us to start licensing other forms of gaming, and raises the standards of our service providers. The MGA wants to bring in a better concept of certification for service providers to allow more products to be launched so that the market can grow and develop. We’re looking to strengthen our compliance and due diligence processes and increase the powers of the MGA, so that we’ll have more teeth when it comes to enforcement, as we must protect and foster a healthy industry. The Key Officials will assume more ownership of the responsibilities they are taking on and will not be allowed to resign in the case where there is a suspension of a licence and the MGA is taking enforcement action. We are adopting a risk based approach and also upgrading our call centre to be able to tackle any potential problems from the get-go, rather than allowing escalation.\n\nQ: What do you see as your current top priority?\n\nWe want to excel in consumer protection, as this can be Malta’s strong point and a force for leading the way globally. Malta must be known for something unique and special, not just because it’s sunny or because there are a lot of operators based here. The aim is to make the name Malta Gaming Authority synonymous with consumer protection.\n\nQ: How do you see the gaming industry developing and what markets are you targeting?\n\nI don’t want to see Malta develop only in terms of licences – the fact that the industry grew by 25% in 2014 is great – but the focus should be on quality rather than quantity. My vision is to grow our portfolio, keep opening up new markets and promote Malta as a top gaming jurisdiction. But we can also provide new services that are currently not provided in other jurisdictions – Malta can be a disaster recovery site, or a base for game development, research and development, as well as an area for back office operations. The big growth markets on the MGA agenda are South America and China, with whom we already have good relations. Digital games are popular in Asia and could be localised. Malta can be special in the sense that it could facilitate access to these markets. However, it won’t be easy because China is a closed market – gambling is illegal, but digital games of skill are legal. For example, poker is considered a game of skill in Asia. In Europe there are a number of challenges, with various member states imposing a requirement on operators to obtain their national licence, before they can provide gaming services in their country. Point of Consumption tax and the new VAT directive are creating obstacles for the potential growth of this sector. I would rather see Europe and regulators work together to tackle the unregulated market, where the player is not protected and not enough is being done.\n\nQ: Where would you like to see Malta positioned in the next five to ten years?\n\nI would like to see Malta recognised as being the true centre of excellence in the global gaming industry. We want operators and players to see Malta as the best location to be based for both our excellent regulatory framework and for the expertise we have created to support the growth of a vibrant industry.\n\nThis article can also be found on the Gaming Malta 2015 publication."

The consultation serves as an opportunity for licensees to actively participate and further contribute towards the development of this code.\n\nIn 2022, the MGA embarked upon a journey – underpinned by the Authority’s objective of promoting a sustainable gaming sector that safeguards players’ rights – to explore the development of such a code, with the aim of guiding and preparing licensees for upcoming ESG legislation (particularly the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive), and of helping them reap the benefits of running a sustainably-conscious operation.\n\nThe ESG code seeks to serve as an instrument for self-regulation, helping remote gaming companies align with best practices and maintain a position that allows them to effectively meet the evolving expectations of key stakeholders in the sector.\n\nThe draft ESG code is the result of a six-month journey, consisting of three extensive stages: the peer review and research phase, materiality assessment, and stakeholder interviews. The pre-consultation activities established a solid foundation for subsequent consultations, ensuring that the code is well-informed and reflective of the industry’s ESG priorities and stakeholder expectations.\n\nThis is now ready for a final round of feedback from key stakeholders.\n\nWhile the proposed code applies to remote gaming companies, the Authority is exploring the possibility of extending it to the land-based sector in Malta, with a view to including such entities within scope in the future, and with ESG disclosures being adapted as required.\n\nKindly contact the Authority on policy.mga@mga.org.mt with any queries or feedback regarding the consultation."

    "url": "https://www.mga.org.mt/licensee-hub/compliance/player-protection/",
    "html": "Home > Licensee Hub > Compliance > Player Protection\n\nPlayer Protection\nResponsible Gaming\n\nGambling is a form of entertainment and should never be perceived as a means of generating income. Whilst most individuals treat gambling as a recreational activity and spend only what they can afford to lose, others are unable to do so. It is therefore of the utmost importance that responsible gambling and player protection is high on the agenda of gaming operators.\n\nThe Authority’s overriding objectives are to promote responsible gaming and to safeguard players’ rights. The aim is to ensure that all players can gamble in a safe, secure and sustainable manner, mitigating the risk of gambling problems or gambling-related harm. This is a shared responsibility between the player, the operator and the Authority. To achieve this objective, licensed operators must always ensure that, players are never encouraged to:\n\nThe Player Protection Directive (Directive 2 of 2018) sets out various obligations which must be rigorously adhered to. As part of the Directive, operators must prominently display on all websites licensed by the Authority:\n\nThe licensee details\nA sign which indicates that underage gaming is not permissible.\nA ‘responsible gaming’ message, explaining that gaming can be harmful if it is not controlled, and information about the player support measures on the website.\nDynamic seal or kite mark\nA link leading to a webpage or application which includes all relevant responsible gaming information required by the Directive. This information must be clear and intelligible, and within one click from anywhere on the website\nA link which enables players to refer to one or more gambling help organisations.\nA message before first deposit, providing information and access to available responsible gaming tools and limits.\nPlayers should never be encouraged to:\n01\nEngage in prolonged, continuous gameplay\n02\nWager winnings\n03\nChase losses\n04\nSpend more than a player can afford\n05\nGamble whilst under the age of 18\nSafer Gambling Tools\n\nIn order to offer a safe gambling environment and experience, and to prevent or minimize gambling-related harm, licensed operators are required to offer the below safer gambling tools.\n\nSelf-Exclusion\n\nEffective self-exclusion programs have been shown to be linked with a reduction of pathological gambling and the effects of gambling-related harm. In view of this, licensed operators must always have an effective and readily available mechanism whereby players can exclude themselves from playing for a definite or indefinite timeframe.\n\nOperators are encouraged to offer a definite self-exclusion for the following timeframes:\n24 Hours\n48 Hours\n7 Days\n30 Days\n90 Days\n180 Days\n365 Days\nThe self-exclusion process must always be available and straightforward. Moreover, a request for a new self-exclusion, or extending a current exclusion must be implemented immediately, with no attempts to induce a player to continue playing.\nWhere multiple brands are operated, with separate registration, the operator must enquire whether the exclusion request is for all brands. However, the operator may apply a self-exclusion on the requested brand only.\nA self-exclusion request shall be applicable across all operated brands, if there are sufficient indications that the player may have problem gambling issues.\nDuring a self-exclusion, players must not access gaming services, however, players must not be prevented from withdrawing funds.\nRemoving a self-exclusion can only be implemented following the account holders request, whereby the player must:\nProvide an explanation why the self-exclusion was requested.\nProvide evidence that they are now able to manage their gambling safely and sustainably.\nWhen reopening an account, it is recommended that operators encourage players to utilise responsible gaming tools. The player may be granted access after at least a 24-hour cooling-off period for a definite exclusion, and 7 days for an indefinite exclusion.\n\nGaming Limits and Reality Checks\n\nIn-line with the Player Protection Directive (Directive 2 of 2018), operators must provide responsible gambling tools, to assist players in managing their gambling in a safe and sustainable manner. Whilst either Deposit or Wagering Limits are mandatory, operators are encouraged to offer further limits:\n\nDeposit Limits – Allows the player to limit the amount of money that can be deposited within a set timeframe; usually daily, weekly or monthly.\nWagering Limits – Limit the amount of money that can be wagered within a timeframe. When calculating the amount wagered, bonuses and other player incentives need not be considered.\nLoss Limits – Allows a player to limit the amount of money that can be lost within a given timeframe; usually daily, weekly or monthly.\nTime Limits or Session Limits – These allow a player to limit the amount of time which they spend playing.\nDuring the player registration process, or before the first deposit, operators must provide players with the opportunity to set either deposit limits or wagering limits and ensure that the ability to set limits always remains available and easily accessible.\nWhere limits are imposed on a player, consideration must be taken that any limits set are realistic to the players income and wealth.\nAny limit implemented can only be removed upon the player’s request or upon the expiry of the set timeframe. Should a player request more stringent limits, this must be effective immediately. Should a player request less stringent limits, this shall only be effective after at least 24 hours from the day on which the operator receives the request.\nWhere a player applies multiple limits, the strictest limit must take precedence. For example, a player sets a €20 per day and a €40 per week wager limits. On day 1, the player wagers €20, and is prevented from wagering any further (the strictest limit is applied). On day 2, €18 is wagered. On day 3, despite the customer having a €20 per day wager limit, the player can only wager €2, as combined throughout the week, the player would have wagered €40, and so this becomes the stricter limit which must be imposed. The player is now prevented from wagering for the remainder of the week.\nOperators must offer players the ability to set a pop-up alert at certain time intervals. The alert shall suspend play and remind players to stay in control of their gambling. The alert must also provide statistics of the amount of time the player has spent playing, the amounts wagered, and any winnings/losses during the gaming session. The player must confirm that the message has been read and be given the option to end the session.\nResponsible Gaming Policies\n\nOperators must have effective and regularly updated policies and procedures to promote responsible gambling. These shall factor in the products offered, and any emanating risks. Such policies shall include a variety of measures to detect and identify problem gambling, and any actions or behaviour that indicates that a player is at risk of developing gambling problems.\n\nWhen concerning behaviour is identified, the operator is obligated to take effective steps to address this, and to prevent exacerbation of existing or developing problems. Operators must retain evidence that the relevant policies and procedures were followed, and a record of any investigations conducted, the decisions taken, and any responsible gaming player interactions conducted.\n\nThe minimum criteria which operators must consider when ascertaining the existence of gambling-related harm include:\n\nThe amount and frequency of deposits and, or wagers\nThe use of multiple payment methods\nThe reversal of pending withdrawals\nCommunication-based indicators such as increased player complaints and bonus requests\nUse of responsible gaming tools\n\nThe above are the minimum required factors to consider when determining the existence of gambling problems, however licensees are encouraged to employ mechanisms which take into consideration other factors, such as:\n\nThe number of declined or failed deposits\nLate-night play and any increase in late-night play\nThe players age\nAverage daily stake\nReinvesting ‘big wins’\nProximity of deposit attempts to payday\nIncrease in the number/variety of games played\nNumber of deposits during gaming sessions\nCustomer only utilises ‘no-deposit bonuses’ for gameplay\n\nOperators must ensure that employees who deal with responsible gaming-related matters, or general player interactions, are routinely and appropriately trained in responsible gaming procedures. Employees must be qualified to look out for any players demonstrating signs or indications of gambling-related harm.\n\nOperators must implement effective policies which prevent minors from making use of their gaming service in any way. These shall include requiring players to affirm that they are of legal age before using the gaming service. Where a minor bypasses these policies and procedures, the operator, upon becoming aware that a player is underage, shall take all necessary steps to block the minor, and to return them to the same position they were in prior to playing, returning any monies wagered and confiscating all winnings.\n\nWith regards to demo games, the operator must ensure that the Return to Player (RTP) percentage for demo games is the same as set on real money games.\n\nComplaints and Disputes\n\nLicensed operators must have a Player Support team, with sufficient resources to effectively interact with players and are required to have a clearly documented procedure for fairly managing complaints and disputes, whilst establishing the expected timeframe to settle a dispute or refer the matter to the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) entity. The procedure shall be readily available to the players and included within the terms and conditions.\n\nWhen a player has exhausted the internal dispute resolution process, operators must offer the opportunity to refer any dispute to a registered ADR entity. Operators must ensure that their complaints procedure includes the details of the ADR entity to whom disputes can be referred to.\n\nThe conclusions of the ADR entity shall be binding upon both parties. Referring a dispute to an ADR entity does not restrict the player’s right to bring proceedings against the operator in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nEngaging an Alternative Dispute Resolution Entity\n\nPrior to ‘going live’, an operator must engage an ADR entity, established within the European Union or the European Economic Area, and competent to adjudicate on gaming disputes. All approved ADR entities can be found here.\n\nWhen a contractual agreement has been reached with an ADR entity, the operator must notify the Authority by uploading a soft copy of the contract via the application entitled ‘Operational-ADR Declaration’, located in the Licensee Portal. The agreement must include the effective date, duration, fees, termination conditions and parties’ signatures. Operators must also inform the Authority upon terminating any agreement with an ADR entity."

    "html": "Home > Licensee Hub > Compliance > Anti-Money Laundering\n\nAnti-Money Laundering\n\nThe MGA has a vested interest to ensure that licences are issued or renewed only if it is reasonably satisfied that the applicant has the necessary policies, procedures and systems in place to effectively manage any ML/FT risks inherent within its business, and that all the persons involved in the applicant company are fit and proper persons.\n\nMGA’s Supervisory Functions\n\nIn terms of the Prevention of Money Laundering and Funding of Terrorism Regulations (PMLFTR), the MGA acts as supervisory authority over the land based and the remote gaming and is thus considered under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) as an ‘agent’ of the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU). As an FIAU agent, the MGA extends its assistance and cooperation to the FIAU in fulfilment of its responsibilities. More specifically, the MGA is responsible for monitoring compliance of casino and gaming licensees with the PMLA, the PMLFTR and any Implementing Procedures or guidance issued thereunder, and for reporting non-compliance with the same to the FIAU.\n\nAML/CFT Obligations – A brief outline\n\nThe anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) obligations require casino and gaming licensees, more specifically B2C licensees offering Type 1, 2 and 3 games, to apply a risk-based approach in applying AML/CFT measures, controls, and procedures.\n\nBy adopting a risk-based approach, licensees can ensure that actions to prevent or mitigate are ML/TF proportionate to the risks identified. The principle is that resources must be allocated on a priority basis so that the most significant risks are given the most attention. To ensure a risk-based approach, licensees must perform a business risk assessment to understand the risks and vulnerabilities to which they may be exposed. Following this, the licensee has to devise a Customer Acceptance Policy and transcribe its AML/CFT policies and procedures outlining how the company will be abiding with its Customer Due Diligence and other various AML/CFT obligations.\n\nFurther information can be provided in the System Audit Checklist.\n\nLicensees are also primarily required to appoint a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) of sufficient seniority and command whose main responsibility is to analyse unusual or suspicious activity or transactions observed within the business activity, and to follow up the same as necessary through the filing of a suspicious transaction report (STR) with the FIAU. In addition, the appointed MLRO has to be registered with the FIAU and an approved Key AML Function by the MGA.\n\nResources\n\nThe Implementing Procedures issued by the FIAU as per its powers under Regulation 17 of the PMLFTR are likewise legally binding instruments. The Implementing Procedures are divided in two parts; Part I is applicable to all sectors and Part II applies to each sector specifically.\n\n \n\nFIAU Implementing Procedures Part I\n\nFIAU Implementing Procedures Part II – Remote Gaming Sector\n\nFIAU Implementing Procedures Part II –Land Based Casino\n\n \n\n \n\nOutreach and Guidance for Operators\n\nIn order to stay abreast with the most recent updates, make sure to subscribe to both the MGA newsletter, and the FIAU newsletter.\n\nBoth the MGA as well as the FIAU hold a number of outreach events, including:\n\nThe Revised Implementing Procedure of the Remote Gaming Sector – What are the Major Changes?\n\nAML/CFT in the Remote Gaming Sector – Trends, Typologies & Common Findings\n\nThe MLRO in the Gaming Sector\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nFIAU Guidance documents repository\n\nResults of the ML/TF Maltese NRA – 2018\n\nEuropean Commission Supranational risk assessment of ML/TF – 2022\n\nMoneyval report on the use of remote gambling for ML/FT\n\nFATF publications\n\n \n\n "

The Guidance Note had been published before the finalisation and publication of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, with the aim of informing Authorised Persons about the potential impacts of Brexit and to provide guidance during a period of uncertainty. Therefore, the Guidance Note is reflective of the Authority’s position preceding the publication and coming into force of the Agreement.\n\nThe publication of the Agreement was pivotal in providing legal clarity as to how the EU-UK relationship will continue post-Brexit and delineated the terms that either Party is bound by in the development of trade and investment between them. The Authority is obliged to adhere to the Agreement’s terms, which supersede any positions held before it entered into force.\n\nIn light of this, the Authority is hereby repealing the Guidance Note, as part of its sustained commitment to ensure its legal and regulatory framework is clear, accurate and up-to-date. Furthermore, through the Notice of Repeal, the Authority has also taken the opportunity to provide additional clarity on the matters outlined within the Guidance Note.\n\nThe repealed Guidance Note may be accessed here.  "

    "title": "Privacy Policy - Malta Gaming Authority",
    "url": "https://www.mga.org.mt/privacy-policy/",
    "html": "Privacy Policy\n\nThe MGA is the regulatory body responsible for the governance and supervision of all gaming activities in and from Malta. It is assigned with the responsibility and official authority to ensure that Malta’s gaming regime is based on a fair, responsible, safe and secure provision of gaming services and it seeks to ensure that the three main pillars of gaming, namely (i) the fairness of games, (ii) the protection of minors and vulnerable persons, and (iii) the prevention of crime, fraud and money laundering, are safeguarded as much as possible.\n\nIt is, therefore, the duty and responsibility of the Authority to process all the data and information as may be required to effectively safeguard the public interest with regards to gaming activities in and from Malta.\n\nWhen determining the purposes and means of the processing of such personal data, the MGA – whose principal place of business is situated at Building SCM 02-03, Level 4, SmartCity Malta, Ricasoli SCM1001, Malta – is acting as the ‘Data Controller’ for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nThis Privacy Policy aims at giving an overview to data subjects of how the MGA deals with issues related to data protection and at informing data subjects of their rights under the GDPR. It also provides all the necessary information needed by Data Subjects to be able to request further information on issues relating to data protection and privacy as may be required.\n\nPersonal Information We Process\n\nThe Authority (“MGA” or “We”, “Us”, “Our”) may collect your personal information in accordance with the terms of this privacy notice. Personal information consists of personal data and, in some cases, may also consist of special categories of personal data. The term ‘personal data’ refers to personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, e-mail or mailing address, CV, or any other supporting documentation you may as a user of the website, or as job-candidate for instance, choose to submit to the Authority.\n\nCertain information may be classified as ‘special category personal data’, such as information about you that may reveal your race, ethnic origin, or political opinion. Should we require your special category personal data, we will request your explicit consent.\n\nThe Authority also collects your personal information when you make use of the following facilities which are provided by the Authority which require, to varying degrees, the voluntary submission of your personal information:\n\nthe services available on the Authority website, namely:\nsubscription to the Authority’s Newsletter and News Alerts; and,\nthe Online Gaming Support and Land-based Gaming Support facilities;\nthe Licensee Relationship Management (LRM) Portal; and,\nthe Recruitment Management System.\n\nWebsite usage information is collected using cookies. For more information on the Authority’s use of cookies, kindly refer to section entitled Cookies, Tags and Other Identifiers (“Cookies”) of this notice.\n\nHow is Personal Information Gathered Used?\n\nWhile fulfilling its role as the regulatory body responsible for the governance and supervision of all gaming activities in and from Malta, the MGA processes certain personal data relating to licensees, players, employees, and the general public, including candidates using the Recruitment Management System.\n\nThe Authority may collect and process your personal information for the following purposes:\n\nto provide its services;\nto carry out its regulatory, licensing and enforcement functions;\nto meet its legal responsibilities as a Regulator and employer; and,\ngenerally, for regulatory and legal reasons.\n\nCollection of Data from the Recruitment Management System\n\nAs part of its recruitment processes, the MGA also collects and processes personal data relating to job applicants. The Authority is committed to being transparent about how it collects and uses that data and to meeting its data protection obligations.\n\nThe MGA collects a wide range of information including:\n\nyour name, address and contact details, including email address and telephone number;\ndetails of your qualifications, skills, experience and employment history;\ninformation about your current level of remuneration, including benefit entitlements;\nwhether or not you have a impairment for which the Authority needs to make reasonable adjustments during the recruitment process; and\ninformation about your entitlement to work in Malta.\n\nThe MGA may collect this information in a variety of ways. Data might be contained in documents which are submitted to the Authority via the ‘Recruitment Management System’, in the form of CVs or resumes, identification documents such as passports or through other means such as interviews or any other form of assessment. The MGA may also collect personal data such as references from third parties such as your former employers. We will seek information from third parties only when the Authority is providing you with a job offer. You will be informed by the Authority that it will be doing so.\n\nData may be stored in a range of different places, including on your candidate profile as created by yourself, in HR management systems and on other IT systems (including email).\n\nData relating to the Recruitment Management System\n\nIf you are accessing this website as a candidate seeking employment, you shall be required to fill out details, including data referred to above, in the ‘create your profile’ section which can be found on the Recruitment Management System which is accessible through the ‘About Us’ tab. Further details related to this system can be found down below. Such details and information provided may be deemed confidential.\n\nThe Authority’s scope in this regard is to provide you with the most appropriate and suitable employment opportunities matching your interests and qualifications. This will also save your time since you will not be required to go through information about jobs and services which are not relevant to your skillset. To this end, we will also use the data internally for research purposes to enhance user experience.\n\nCandidates shall take full responsibility for the integrity and the accuracy of the data provided.\n\nShould you decline to provide us with any such data we will not be able to provide you with our Service.\n\nCreation of a Candidate Profile on the Recruitment Management System\n\nAny data which are inputted by yourself as a candidate when creating your candidate profile, are stored by the MGA. Since you are the one who will be creating your profile, you will need to read and accept this Privacy Policy. No CVs are accepted or received by ordinary mail or email. Should the MGA receive any CVs through such means, such candidates shall be redirected to where the creation of a candidate-profile can be made. CVs sent outside of the Recruitment Management System shall be deleted or destroyed.\n\nWhen you successfully create your profile, you will gain and retain full access to the data inputted in the profile and you will also have the facility to change, delete, amend or modify such data independently. You shall have full responsibility for the accuracy of the data that you have entered when creating your profile.\n\nThe MGA may send you an automated email to alert you about any changes to the profile you could have made, including for example the removal of a CV or any other information which is considered integral to your job search.\n\nOnce your profile is fully active, you may be contacted about your profile. We may or may not enable or disable job alerts based on your preferences. When you are approached by us about a specific vacancy, we would require your consent to be able to proceed.\n\nShould your profile not show any activity for twelve (12) months, you will receive an automated email asking you to activate your profile to ensure that this will not be deleted by us. Should you not activate your profile for a continuous period of six months following this notification, your profile and all data which would have been stored by us will be deleted.\n\nIf your application for employment is a successful one, personal data gathered during the recruitment process will be transferred to your Human Resources file (electronic and/or paper-based) and retained during your employment. Your data will then be held in terms of our data retention periods and data protection policy that will be made available to you.\n\nWhy does the MGA process personal data?\n\nThe MGA may need to process your data to be able to enter into a contract with you.\n\nIn some cases, we need to process data to ensure that we are complying with our legal obligations. For example, it is mandatory to check a successful applicant’s eligibility to work in Malta before employment starts.\n\nThe MGA has a legitimate interest in processing personal data during the recruitment process and for keeping records of the process. Processing data from job applicants allows us to manage the recruitment process, assess and confirm a candidate’s suitability for employment and ultimately decide who shall be offered the job. We may also need to process data from job applicants to respond to and defend against legal claims.\n\nThe MGA may, for the purposes of ensuring that it is an equal opportunities employer, collect information about whether or not applicants have a disability to be able to make reasonable adjustments for such candidates. We process such information to carry out our legal obligations and to exercise specific rights in relation to employment.\n\nFollowing the activation of your profile and after the commencement and finalisation of the recruiting process, and where your application for employment with the Authority is unsuccessful, the MGA will hold your personal data on file for a further twelve (12) months in case there are future employment opportunities for which you may be suited. We will ask for your consent before keeping your data for this purpose when you submit your documentation on the recruitment system and you will remain free to withdraw your consent at any time. You may also seek to have your information rectified at any time. At the end of that period, or once you withdraw your consent, your data is deleted or destroyed.\n\nWho has access to data?\n\nYour information may be shared internally strictly for the recruitment exercise. This includes members of the HR and recruitment team, interviewers involved in the recruitment process, managers in the business area of the relative vacancy and IT staff if they require access to the data for the performance of their roles.\n\nWe may share your data with the employers you identified in your documentation in order to obtain references about you. We may also share your data with employment background check-providers in order to obtain the necessary background checks.\n\nWe process this data on the basis of a contractual relationship between you and the Authority which is deemed to have become effective once you confirm that you have read and agreed to this Privacy Notice. By entering into this agreement, you are confirming that your former employers referred to within the documentation, you submitted through the recruitment process, as well as any employment background check providers, may forward any information concerning yourself to the Authority.\n\nSharing Personal Data\n\nAll profiles created by you on the Recruitment Management System are created on a system called Talexio which is a third-party platform. This platform is wholly owned by Preeo Studios Limited, used by the MGA and hosted on Amazon Web Services. The data provided to create a profile shall be kept on this third-party platform. The MGA shall treat all CVs, profiles and documentation related thereto in strict confidence provided that per the aforesaid, it may refer to a candidate’s former employer or employers and background check service providers.\n\nHow does the MGA protect data?\n\nWe take the security of your data seriously. We have internal policies and controls in place to ensure that your data is not lost, accidentally destroyed, misused or disclosed, and is not accessed except by our employees in the proper performance of their duties.\n\nWhat if you do not provide personal data?\n\nYou are under no statutory or contractual obligation to provide data to the MGA during the recruitment process. However, if you do not provide such information, we may not be able to process your application properly or at all.\n\nLegal Protection\n\nThe Authority is required to adhere to the Data Protection Act (Cap. 586 of the Laws of Malta) (the “Data Protection Act”) and other relevant regulations, legal notices and similar instruments that may be in force, taking account of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and the Electronic Communications Privacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC) (the “Directives”) (the “Data Protection Laws”).\n\nAll this is in place in order to assure you that at all times your personal information is:\n\nprocessed in accordance with your rights\nprocessed fairly and lawfully\nobtained only for a specific and lawful purpose\nadequate, relevant and not excessive to its purpose\naccurate and updated\nkept in a secure manner\nnot kept longer than is necessary for its purpose\nnot transferred to jurisdictions which do not adhere to the aforementioned Directives.\n\nAny person about whom we hold information has rights under the Data Protection Laws. You may:\n\nbe informed if we hold personal information relating to you;\nrequest the specific purpose of the processing, and categories processed, of your personal information;\nrequest access to the personal information we hold about you, in which case, and subject to Section 7 of the Privacy Policy, we will provide you with a copy of the information requested;\nrequest the envisaged period for which your personal information will be stored by us, or, if this is not possible, the criteria used to determine this period;\nhave any inaccurate data corrected or removed in certain circumstances; and\nsubmit a complaint to the Information and Data Protection Commissioner in Malta where you believe that we have not complied with the Data Protection Laws.\n\nFor further information on how your personal information is used, how we maintain the security of your personal information, and your rights to access the information we hold on you, please get in touch with us in the manner specified in the ‘Getting in Touch with Us’ section of this notice.\n\nYour Rights\n\nFurther to the above rights, please note that if your application for employment is unsuccessful, as a data subject, subject to certain conditions and limitations, you have several rights.\n\nYou may:\n\naccess and obtain a copy of your data on request\nrequire the MGA to change incorrect or incomplete data\nrequire the MGA to delete or stop processing your data, for example where the data is no longer necessary for the purposes of processing\nobject to the processing of your data in cases where the MGA is relying on its legitimate interests as the legal ground for processing.\n\nAccess, corrections and deletions\n\nIf you wish to view any of your personal information we hold, or have any inaccurate data corrected or removed, you can make a request (“A Data Subject Request”) to this effect.\n\nA data subject request shall be made by sending an email to that Authority’s Data Protection Officer (DPO) to the following email address: dpo.mga@mga.org.mt. The email shall contain your full name, address, and a description of the information you wish to view, correct or delete.\n\nThe Authority’s DPO may request further information from the data subject making the request should any clarifications be required. Furthermore, to ensure confidentiality and to verify the identity of the person making the data subject request, the DPO may request a photo to be taken of the subject person holding a photo identification document clearly showing name, identification number and facial photo on document.\n\nIt is important to note that the rights of data subjects are tied with certain conditions and limitations that are stipulated within the GDPR itself.\n\nThe Authority reserves the right to charge a reasonable fee for repetitive requests, requests for further copies of the same data, and, or requests which are deemed to be manifestly unfounded or excessive. We may also refuse to act upon requests that are deemed to be manifestly unfounded or excessive.\n\nCookies, tags and other identifiers (“Cookies”)\n\nCookies are text files placed on your computer or mobile device to collect standard internet log information and visitor behaviour information.

    "html": "NEWS\n18 January 2024\nMalta’s 2023 National Risk Assessment Released\n\nMalta’s 2023 National Risk Assessment (NRA) has recently been published, providing a comprehensive assessment of the country’s exposure to threats and vulnerabilities stemming from money laundering, terrorist financing, proliferation financing and targeted financial sanction risks.\n\nThe NRA holds significant relevance for subject persons, providing them with crucial insights into existing risks and enabling them to effectively adjust their compliance approach and risk mitigation strategies.\n\nCoordinated by the National Coordinating Committee on Combating Money Laundering and Funding of Terrorism (NCC), the NRA was developed in close collaboration with all government authorities involved in the fight against financial crime and representative bodies from the private sector.\n\nKey findings from the NRA include:\n\nMalta’s overall money laundering residual risk has decreased when compared to the 2018 NRA, reflecting the effectiveness of mitigating measures implemented by authorities and the private sector.\nNotable improvements were registered across a number of sectors, including legal persons, trust and company service providers, banking, investment services, accountants and auditors, gaming, and virtual financial assets service providers.\nOther sectors, in particular financial institutions, real estate agents, and dealers in high-value goods, also registered lower levels of risk. Nevertheless, compared to others, these sectors are susceptible to a higher risk of money laundering.\nSome of the higher risks identified include laundering proceeds from drug trafficking, foreign organised crime, and fraud (including cybercrime).\nMoney laundering typologies presenting a higher level of residual risk include the abuse of cash and cash-based businesses, the use of Maltese registered companies lacking sufficient links to Malta, complex corporate structures, and the acquisition of high-value movable and immovable property.\nResidual risks associated with terrorism financing, proliferation financing, and targeted financial sanctions were found to be moderate.\n\nAll subject persons are obliged to consider the risks identified in this latest version of the NRA as part of their risk assessment process, reviewing and updating their controls, policies and procedures as necessary to reflect and mitigate the identified risks.\n\nThe 2023 NRA is available for download here."

    "html": "NEWS\n31 January 2024\nMGA plants a tree for every new employee!\n\nThe Malta Gaming Authority has embarked on a new initiative that continues to echo our commitment towards Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles. As a part of our ongoing efforts to champion sustainability, we are proud to announce a unique initiative, whereby one tree is planted for every new employee who joins the Authority.\n\nKicking off this project, the MGA recently planted 17 trees, a mixture of the indigenous Tamarisk and Chaste trees, at the Marsaskala Nature Trust Reserve. This area is currently undergoing several conservation projects, and we hope that our initiative contributes to this mission.\n\n17 MGA employees, who joined the Authority over the year 2023, got their hands dirty planting the saplings and learnt more about conservation, what needs to be done when planting a tree, and the after-care that Nature Trust will carry out to ensure that  these trees continue to grow.\n\nChristopher Formosa, Deputy CEO and COO, said: “This initiative aligns perfectly with the MGA’s dedication to fostering a more sustainable future. By planting a tree in the name of our new joiners, we aim not only to signify the beginning of their journey with us, but also to symbolise the professional growth and development we anticipate for both them and our organisation”."
