We’ve provided crisis counseling, treatment, and resources to people experiencing gambling problems and offered support and guidance to their families. All our services are free, and our helpline coordinators are available 24/7.\n\nAdditionally, we have extensive outreach and prevention efforts.  This includes media campaigns, literature distribution, educational workshops, and sponsorship of prevention activities across the state. \n\nWe are an accredited provider of continuing education units and offer mental health and social service professionals a range of training, from short introductory courses to extensive courses that allow them to become part of our treatment network.\n\n \n\nWHAT IS A GAMBLING PROBLEM?\n\nGambling takes many forms, but it’s always about taking chances. There’s typically money or other possessions on the line, and whether it’s the lottery, slots, or cards – winning or losing is always random.\n\nProblem gambling – or gambling addiction – involves the compulsion to take chances that are capable of damaging personal, family, or vocational pursuits. Unfortunately, the loved ones of the gambler are often affected as much as the gambler. It’s estimated that between 4 and 6 million Americans can be considered as having a gambling problem. For each of these, there is a family who is also suffering."

Youth are 2-4 times more likely to develop a gambling problem than adults. There is a great overlap between Gambling Disorder and the recently categorized “Gaming Disorder” which focuses on internet use and video game play. We will discuss the highly controversial game feature of loot boxes. We will discuss the surprising results of recent surveys of youth on the issues of gaming and gambling, and the implications, especially considering the rapid expansion of “e-sports” teams in schools.\nLearning Objectives:\n1. Participant will learn how early conditioning and game design can make youth susceptible to gambling issues\n2. Participant will learn early warning signs of problem gambling/gaming in youth, problems associated with the disorder, and why prevention services for these issues are crucial\n\nSpeaker Bio: Sheila Moran\n\nSheila is Director of Communications and Marketing for First Choice Services (FCS), a West-Virginia based non-profit that operates 16 helplines, most of which focus on behavioral health.

    "title": "Facts and Fallacies — 1-800-GAMBLER",
    "url": "https://www.1800gambler.net/facts-fallacies",
    "html": "Scroll\n \nFind out about these common beliefs that contribute to problem gambling\nFeatured\nSelective Recall\n\nSome gamblers choose to remember only the times they win, but do not acknowledge — or they “forget” — the times they lose.\n\nChasing Beliefs\n\nThis is the attitude that money lost by gambling has not really been lost because it can be recovered through further gambling.\n\nSuperstitions and Rituals\n\nSome gamblers begin to believe that certain objects, events, actions or supernatural forces may be helping or hindering their gambling wins.\n\nNear-Miss Beliefs\n\nThis is the belief that a gambler is about to win because his or her bets appear to get “close” to the winning number/bet. In reality, there is no such thing as “getting closer” to the winning number because, in gambling games, each event in a game has little or no effect on the next event. The belief that someone is “almost winning” is just a part of the gambler’s faulty perception.\n\nThe Gambler’s Fallacy\n\nThis is the belief that if something has not happened for a long time, it is bound to happen. For example, some gamblers believe that if a coin has flipped heads nine times in a row, it is likely that the next flip will be tails. In reality, the chance of getting heads is exactly the same as it always is — 50/50. The notion that tails are due is just a common error that many people make regarding the randomness concept.\n\nSystems\n\nGamblers believe that, by learning a certain system of betting, they can overcome the house advantage (doubling up, for example). While in the short run they might win by pure chance, in the long run, they would still lose money, as no system can beat the house advantage.\n\nIllusion of Control\n\nGamblers begin to believe that wins are produced by their own efforts (e.g. how they throw the dice or push the button) rather than by the random operation of a gambling device or cards.\n\nBelief in Lucky Streaks\n\nSome gamblers believe that events happen in streaks. They gamble beyond their limits because they feel they are “doing well” or “in a lucky streak.” The truth is, events are random and unconnected. What they recognize as a “streak” is an erroneous belief, not the reality of the game.\n\nEntrapment/Sunk Cost Fallacy\n\nProblem gamblers spend a lot of time, energy and money gambling. After losing for a while, they begin to regard their expenditures as an “investment” rather than the cost of playing. Instead of walking away and accepting losses, the gambler continues to gamble in order to win back the money lost. This thinking creates a vicious cycle that entraps the gambler, resulting in persistent gambling despite mounting losses.\n\nIndependence of Events\n\nAnother fact about casino games is that each event in a game occurs either totally or partially independently from all other events in that game — what’s already happened has little or no effect on what will happen next. For example, in roulette, each time the ball lands is totally independent of another time. The ball has no memory of earlier spins and lands at any one spot on the wheel on a random basis. Games such as blackjack are not totally independent because, once a card is played, the composition of the remaining deck changes, thus affecting the future outcomes of the game. While events in blackjack partially depend on each other, the multiple decks of cards used and the casino’s rules of the game mean that players are still unable to make reliable predictions on the outcomes. Independence of events and randomness are important concepts. If misunderstood, distorted and faulty beliefs about gambling games (e.g. “winning or losing streaks” or “near miss beliefs”) can arise.\n\nResearch shows problem gamblers tend to have a poorer understanding of these concepts, making them more likely than non-problem gamblers to have faulty beliefs. Frequent irrational thinking, myths, and beliefs provide problem gamblers with “reasons” to continue gambling despite experiencing problems in one or all areas of their lives. Gamblers who hold these faulty beliefs may be more susceptible to excessive gambling. Here are some examples:\n\nRandomness\n\nAnother important fact is that casino games are based on random events. Casinos make sure that all their games are random and unpredictable, making it impossible to figure out a system for predicting what will happen next. For example, electronic gaming devices (e.g. slots) have a computer chip called a Random Number Generator that continually produces random numbers, even when no one is playing the game. When a player pushes the deal or spin button, it’s like blindly putting a hand into this river of numbers, pulling one out and putting it on the screen. If this number is a “winning number” (a winning poker hand or line-up combination), the player wins. If not, he or she loses. Unfortunately, there are always more losing numbers in the river than there are winning numbers. In games such as roulette, the spot on the wheel where the ball lands is completely random. In a blackjack game, no one knows for sure which card will turn up next from the deck of cards. For most casino games, as players become more familiar with a game, it’s natural for them to notice patterns. However, even if they notice what seems to be a pattern a few times, this “pattern” still only reflects what happened in the past. What will happen in the future will occur on a random basis — the next event is unpredictable and no one can know for sure what future outcomes will be.\n\nHouse Advantage (House Edge)\n\nHouse advantage is the mathematical advantage the house or gambling operator has on most wagers made by the players. House advantage is built into the games so the casino/gambling operators will make money in the long run. House advantage comes in various forms, including paying the “casino odds” on winning bets rather than “true odds” for most games, charging a commission on winning bets (e.g. baccarat) or ensuring that the rules of the game are in its favor (e.g. players can bust before the dealer takes any cards in blackjack). The casino odds, or pay-off odds, are not the true odds of the game. For example, in roulette, there are 37 numbers on the wheel. The true odds of picking the right number is 1 in 37 but, if players win, they are only paid 35 to 1. This difference gives the house an advantage, ensuring that it will make money over time. In the short run, the players might find themselves ahead through sheer chance, but the longer they play, the more likely it is that they will lose money due to the house advantage. The other forms of house advantage, such as commission on winning bets or the rules of the games, have the same effect as paying less than true odds for the players. Some games have greater house advantage than others, but virtually all casino games have house advantage built into the games. Some players don’t fully understand these facts and feel they are being cheated after losing money over time. In fact, casinos don’t need to cheat or rig games — they already have the house advantage system built into their games to make sure they will make money in the long run. What these players have experienced only reflects the reality of gambling games.\n\n \nGambling Myths Vs.

Those who hold these faulty beliefs may be more susceptible to excessive gambling. Here are some examples:\n\nBACK TO TOP ^\n\nEntrapment/Sunk Cost Fallacy\n\nThose who problem gamble spend a lot of time, energy, and money gambling. After losing for a while, they begin to regard their expenditures as an “investment” rather than the cost of playing. Instead of walking away and accepting losses, the gambler continues to gamble in order to win back the money lost. This thinking creates a vicious cycle that entraps the gambler, resulting in persistent gambling despite mounting losses.\n\nBACK TO TOP ^\n\nBelief in Lucky Streaks\n\nSome gamblers believe that events happen in streaks. They gamble beyond their limits because they feel they are “doing well” or “in a lucky streak.” The truth is, events are random and unconnected. What they recognize as a “streak” is an erroneous belief, not the reality of the game.\n\nBACK TO TOP ^\n\nIllusion of control\n\nGamblers begin to believe that wins are produced by their own efforts (e.g. how they throw the dice or push the button) rather than by the random operation of a gambling device or cards.\n\nBACK TO TOP ^\n\nSystems\n\nGamblers believe that, by learning a certain system of betting, they can overcome the house advantage (doubling up, for example). While in the short run they might win by pure chance, in the long run, they would still lose money, as no system can beat the house advantage.\n\nBACK TO TOP ^\n\nThe Gambler’s Fallacy\n\nThis is the belief that if something has not happened for a long time, it is bound to happen. For example, some gamblers believe that if a coin has flipped heads nine times in a row, it is likely that the next flip will be tails. In reality, the chance of getting heads is exactly the same as it always is — 50/50. The notion that tails are due is just a common error that many people make regarding the randomness concept.\n\nBACK TO TOP ^\n\nNear-Miss Beliefs\n\nThis is the belief that a gambler is about to win because his or her bets appear to get “close” to the winning number/bet. In reality, there is no such thing as “getting closer” to the winning number because, in gambling games, each event in a game has little or no effect on the next event. The belief that someone is “almost winning” is just a part of the gambler’s faulty perception.\n\nBACK TO TOP ^\n\nSuperstitions and rituals\n\nSome gamblers begin to believe that certain objects, events, actions or supernatural forces may be helping or hindering their gambling wins.\n\nBACK TO TOP ^\n\nChasing Beliefs\n\nThis is the attitude that money lost by gambling has not really been lost because it can be recovered through further gambling.\n\nBACK TO TOP ^\n\nSelective recall\n\nSome gamblers choose to remember only the times they win, but do not acknowledge — or they “forget” — the times they lose.\n\nBACK TO TOP ^\n\nFallacies\nMyths\nHouse Edge\nRandomness\nIndependence of Events\nEntrapment/Sunk Cost Fallacy\nBelief in Lucky Streaks\nIllusion of Control\nSystems\nThe Gambler’s Fallacy\nNear-Miss Beliefs\nSuperstitions and Rituals\nChasing Beliefs\nSelective Recall"

Gambling thus requires three elements to be present: consideration, risk, and a prize.\n\n“gambling” means buying lottery tickets, gambling at a casino, playing cards or dice for money, betting on sports games, playing slot machines, video poker or other video gambling, gambling on the internet, betting on horses or dogs, playing bingo or keno.\n\nLikewise, gaming is defined as:\n\nthe act or practice of gambling\n\nplaying games that imitate possible business situations or war maneuvers, as preparation or training\n\nthe act or practice of playing computer or video games\n\nProblem gambling – or gambling addiction – involves the compulsion to take chances that are capable of damaging personal, family, or vocational pursuits. Unfortunately, the loved ones of the gambler are often affected as much as the gambler. It’s estimated that between 4 and 6 million Americans can be considered problem gamblers.

How old are the people in those scenarios? Do you hear “gambling” and think of a 14 year old placing bets on their favorite esports team? What about a 10 year old opening loot crates in a video game? The point is, you may be gambling even if you don’t think of it that way. And where there’s gambling, there’s risk. And what’s the greatest risk? Developing a gambling problem, especially young, is a set-up for a lifetime of struggles. If you think you or someone you know might have a gambling problem, call 1-800-GAMBLER anytime. It’s fast, free, and confidential.\n\n \nEsports\n\nWatching players battle against each other to win your favorite video game can be fun, but if you find yourself using real (or fake) money to bet on the outcome, it won’t be fun explaining to your parents where all your money went.\n\n \nOnline Gambling\n\nIt’s easy to get sucked into spending too much time online, sometimes at the expense of your school work or social life. When gambling is involved, it’s even trickier. Online casinos and games, whether you’re using real or fake money, can lure you into thinking you're just a click away from a big jackpot. \n\nSports Betting\n\nMany people think that because they are good with sports, or with numbers, they can easily make a lot of money betting on sports.  The truth is, even if you have occasional wins, odds are you’ll eventually lose more than you ever won. \n\n \nFantasy Leagues\n\nYour dream team can quickly turn into a nightmare for your wallet if you think this is a good way to make a buck.  The big companies that run these sites count on players to overestimate their luck and skill so they can cash in on your hopes. \n\nLoot Boxes\n\nLoot Crates, Treasure Chests, Prize Boxes, – they have tons of names but what they share is complete randomness. Instead of just paying for the gear or upgrade that you really want, you “roll the dice” until you get the prize you’re looking for. A slot machine uses a very similar method. Players complain about these features, but you can guess why developers keep using them. \n\n \n2-4x MORE Risk\n\nKids who gamble are at 2 to 4 times more risk of developing a gambling problem than adults. That means instead of saving for a house or a car, all your money ends up in someone else’s pocket-and you have nothing to show for it.\n\nYouth Survey Results\n\nMany are surprised to learn that young people gamble, and that they are 2-4 times more likely to become addicted to gambling than adults. We worked with youth groups around the state to survey hundreds of middle and high school students about their feelings and experiences with gambling. We learned that many students here in West Virginia do gamble, and some are already showing signs of problem gambling. \n\nHow often do you bet for money?\nHave you ever felt concerned that one of your friends/family members spends too much time and/or money betting?\nWhy do you gamble?\nHave you participated in any of the following types of gambling?\n128 did not think gambling could become an addiction \n41 said they gambled “often” \n21 admitted they hid their gambling from others \n67 said they would like to stop gambling, but did not know how\n\nCollege Survey Results\n\nAccording to the National Council on Problem Gambling, 75% of college students gambled during the last year, and 6% have a serious gambling problem. We surveyed 250 student athletes in WV to find out about their experiences with and attitudes towards gambling.\n\nSince beginning college, have you ever participated in any of the following types of gambling for money?\n \nDo you think gambling is a good way to make money?\nDo you have any friends who spend too much time or money gambling?\nHave you spent too much time or money gambling in the past?\n \nHelpful Links\n\nhttps://www.ncpgambling.org/files/HS_Fact_Sheet.pdf \n\nhttp://www.ncpgambling.org/files/NPGAWcollegefactsheet.pdf "

    "html": " \nall about GAMBLING\n \nWhat is Gambling?\n\nGambling (or “betting” or “gaming”) is the wagering of money or something of value, including time, on an event with an uncertain outcome, with the primary intent of winning money, material goods, or status. Gambling thus requires three elements to be present: consideration, risk, and a prize.\n\n“gambling” means buying lottery tickets, gambling at a casino, playing cards or dice for money, betting on sports games, playing slot machines, video poker or other video gambling, gambling on the internet, betting on horses or dogs, playing bingo or keno.\n\nLikewise, gaming is defined as:\n\nthe act or practice of gambling\n\nplaying games that imitate possible business situations or war maneuvers, as preparation or training\n\nthe act or practice of playing computer or video games\n\nProblem gambling – or gambling addiction – involves the compulsion to take chances that are capable of damaging personal, family, or vocational pursuits. Unfortunately, the loved ones of the gambler are often affected as much as the gambler. It’s estimated that between 4 and 6 million Americans can be considered problem gamblers. For each of these, there is a family who is also suffering.\n\nSee common gambling myths here\n\nThe State of Gambling in WV\n\nSafer Gambling\n\nMore About Problem Gambling\n\nDo I have a problem? Take the Quiz here!\n\nAccording to the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed., 2013), disordered gambling is a behavioral addiction. A gambling disorder is “persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress” and is diagnosed if the person has four or more of the following in the past year:\n\nNeeds to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement.\n\nIs restless or irritable with attempting to cut down or stop gambling.\n\nHas made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back or stop gambling.\n\nIs often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble).\n\nOften gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed).\n\nAfter losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (“chasing” one’s losses).\n\nLies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling.\n\nHas jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling.\n\nRelies on others to provide money or relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling.\n\nGambling disorder can range from mild to severe.\n\nDo you know someone who might have a gambling disorder? There is free and confidential help. Contact 1-800-GAMBLER today.\n\n \n\nMany forms of gambling, from slot machines to lottery tickets, are indistinguishable from games to some kids. On top of that, there are several games made for kids that can contain elements of gambling. One common form of gambling found in games is the “loot box”, sometimes called “lockbox” or “mystery box”. Rather than paying for an item or an upgrade in a game, this gives players an option to pay for the CHANCE of winning their desired item. See below for an illustration of how this works.\n\n \nView fullsize\n \n \n\nThis website is presented by The Problem Gambling Help Network of WV\n\n "

I didn’t realize that I had such a problem until I called to get help. Now I tell everyone I know there is more to life than machines. I would get my paycheck on Saturday and be broke on Sunday, most of the time losing everything I owned. The only thing I had left was personal belongings, and because of the addiction I had to stay with a friend.\n\nAt this point, life was not worth living. I was depressed, lost all my friends, lost interest in my hobbies; some nights I went to bed hoping I wouldn’t wake up. I had hit rock bottom and knew I had to do something. Driving to work I saw your sign, but I told myself I didn’t need help and kept driving. The next day, depressed, I decided to call. Thank God I did - it changed my life! You all got me the help I needed. Now two years later I’m clean, I have money in the bank, a beautiful wife, a loving family, and I’m getting ready to buy a home. I never knew the difference that one phone call could make in a person’s life. I thank you for all you’ve done for me. Life is wonderful!\n\nThe Chaser\n\nWhen I received an invitation to attend a treatment weekend for compulsive gamblers, I knew I had to attend. I had started gambling small - $5 a hand at Black Jack for a couple hours once in a while. A big win was so exciting it would trigger me to come back more often and gamble larger amounts. When I would lose, I'd stay longer, cashing checks to try to win my money back. It's called chasing your losses. This had been going on for about three years, and I had lost all I could afford to lose. I had lost the will to live. \n\nBefore I started gambling, I was rarely late on a payment, rarely bounced a check, and had an excellent credit rating. I lost all of my savings and investments and most of my retirement. I had also lost my pride and the respect of my family. That's why I grabbed the chance to attend the treatment weekend offered by First Choice.\n\nWhen I arrived at Chief Logan State Park, I was embarrassed and alone. I was scared to death that I would run into someone I knew. Sometimes you just have to swallow your pride and ask for the help you need. In the line of work I'm in, it's really hard to admit that.\n\nThe weekend was really great. I learned so much about how gambling works - how it entices you with lies and expectations of the big win. In reality, it delivers only pain and loss. If you talk to a gambler, they will tell you all about their big win. What they don't tell you is how many times they lost before they had that big win and how many times they went back after the win expecting to win again.\n\nSince that weekend, I have not gambled even once. I’ve learned that it’s not the way to get ahead. I'm working my way out of the hole that I had dug. Thank you for helping me kick the habit that nearly destroyed my life. My family thanks you as well.\n\nA New Beginning\n\n\nI remember going with my Dad to a bar when I was six. He would give me a cup full of nickels and I would go behind a curtain that hid what was called “the one arm bandit” -  one of the old-fashioned slot machines. I would put my nickel in, pull down the arm, and then listen to the nickels fall into the tray. Wow, was that fun! Little did I know that the dopamine in my brain would later be awakened by the modern-day, full-color, 3D, fun, crazy-sounding game machines. I’d gambled for quite a few years. Always chasing my losses, trying to ignore the fact that I had a gambling problem.  \n\nOnce I’d start playing, it was like nothing else mattered. I would forget about anything that was bothering me. It was like being hypnotized. I was constantly paying overdraft fees. Then I got caught up in going to the fast cash-advance places just to pay my bills. This only made the problem worse because of the high interest rates. I was sinking faster and faster. I’d borrowed money from my family a few times, but then when they found out that I was gambling, they stopped helping. It was called tough love. I couldn’t blame them. I felt so ashamed, embarrassed, lost and all alone.\n\nI’d battled alcoholism, and beat it, but this addiction was so much harder to understand. I never imagined that I couldn’t stop gambling on my own. Then there came a time when I realized that I had just spent my water bill money while playing a machine. How could this be? I went home and phoned the number that was on the front of the machine (1-800-Gambler). I was in a panic. The woman on the other end couldn’t have been any nicer. She explained to me that the State would help me with my gambling problem. In just a few minutes, this person I was confiding in, began the process to my recovery. I began to have hope.\n\nI went to my first Retreat for Problem Gamblers in Morgantown. There I learned all about the disease (Compulsive Gambling) and how it not only affects your brain, but your whole wellbeing. Everyone was very compassionate. They genuinely care about you. The resources, and support, that they have provided me with have made an enormous difference in my life.  \n\nI was assigned a Counselor. I then began my counseling sessions. I interacted with my counselor, opened up and let out all of the bad things that had been weighing me down. You would be amazed at what can actually trigger a gambling problem. I paid attention to all of the helpful information about this terrible disease. Each day it became just a little easier to understand and to overcome. I then began to see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nNow, two years later – I have not gambled for almost a whole year. I have not had an overdraft fee, in my checking account, for an entire year. I have implemented little changes like, 1) Rerouting my way home - as to avoid the temptation of stopping at a gambling café, 2) I’ve told my friends, if they want to see me then they have to meet me somewhere there are no machines. 3) I’ve been able to change my thought pattern. If I start to think of gambling I tell myself, “It’s only a thought, think of something else.”  After all, another thought is always just around the corner. And, 4) I started attending my local church. I was baptized last May. It helped me to rid myself of all the guilt and shame that I had felt. It was a new beginning. You would be amazed at how much having God in your life can help you overcome compulsive gambling. He loves you and will see you through anything. Thank God for the people at First Choice Services and the 1-800-Gambler Hotline. They truly have changed my life!"

    "url": "https://www.1800gambler.net/for-loved-ones",
    "html": "For Loved Ones\n\nMany of our calls on the helpline come from the loved ones of a gambler.  There are many emotions involved in these conversations.  Loved ones may be confused, angry, sad, worried, and unsure of what to do.  We often hear, “Why should I get help?  I don’t have a gambling problem.”  \n\nGambling takes many forms, but it always involves taking chances, and winning or losing is always random.  Problem gambling involves the compulsion to continue gambling despite interfering with daily activities, including personal, financial, and vocational/educational.  It is estimated that between 4 and 6 million Americans can be considered problem gamblers.  For each person battling a gambling problem, there are loved ones who are suffering as well.  Loved ones cannot force a problem gambler to stop; however, they can take steps that will hopefully lead the gambler to get help.  We have counselors, support groups, weekend events, other resources, and treatment funds to help loved ones and problem gamblers.\n\nProblem gambling can lead to great financial burden.  Many times bill money is lost, possessions are pawned, retirement funds and savings are depleted or extensive credit is owed.  Loved ones may not be aware of the extensive debt but may be held responsible.  You cannot control the gambler or how they handle money but there are ways to protect your finances as much as possible.  For example, remove your name from joint accounts, change the password on accounts, store valuables in a safe deposit box, throw away new offers for credit that come in the mail, refuse to co-sign loans, and ask others not to lend money to the gambler, take over paying household bills and limit access to cash/credit.  If the problem gambler commits to stop gambling, encourage them to remove their name from accounts, contact creditors/family, and establish a debt repayment plan.  \n\nSince you care about your loved one, saying “no” is difficult when they ask or beg for money.  Just like with other addictions, it is crucial not to bail them out or enable them to harm themselves.  Know you are helping them, even if they do not realize it at the time.  Encourage them to seek help for the problem through counseling, support groups, and other resources.  Show support for their recovery, not the addiction.  \n\nBe prepared for the ramifications of setting boundaries and removing access to money.  The problem gambler is also dealing with many mixed emotions including guilt, shame, anger, and hostility.  Consider reaching out for support from other family, friends, clergy, and/or counselors.  Keep in mind, change can be slow but change can happen.  It will not be easy but it will be worth it.  \n\nYou cannot force the gambler into therapy, but you can start the healing process by getting help for yourself.  Why should you see a counselor?  Counseling will start the healing of your wounds, teach you how to protect yourself financially, provide insight on how to do an intervention, explore ways not to enable the gambler, and open the door to the gambler also seeking help.  \n\nBy calling 1-800-GAMBLER or choosing the chat option on our website, you will reach someone in West Virginia who will take the time to listen and help you find treatment and resources.  The call is free, the first appointment is free and there are treatment funds available, if needed, for ongoing sessions.  Take the first step today.  There is hope, there is help and there is recovery.  "

National studies, as well as surveys we’ve done in West Virginia, show that middle and high school kids not only gamble but are already starting to suffer consequences from it. The problem is even more pronounced on college campuses. Yet, many adults fail to recognize this as a problem and actively encourage youth gambling. We’ll talk about the types of gambling youth are most likely to engage in, why they are at high risk, how they can seek help, and how you can advocate for youth in your community. \n\nPresenter: Sheila Moran, MSW, LSW, ICGC\n\nRegister Here\nView Event →\nMar\n21\n9:00 AM09:00\nMountain State Summit on Gambling Addiction\nTuesday, March 21, 2023\n9:00 AM 6:00 PM 09:00 18:00\nTHE COTTAGE AT NORTHGATE (map)\nGoogle Calendar ICS\nJoin us at THE COTTAGE AT NORTHGATE \n\nEARN UP TO 6.25 CEU’S \n\nEarn CEU’s for Addictions, SW, Nursing, & LPC \n\nSPACE IS LIMITED!\n\nRegister Now\n\nContact Tara for questions \n\n \nView Event →\nMar\n19\nto Mar 21\nPGHNWV Annual Advanced Clinical Training*\nSun, Mar 19, 2023 9:00 AM 09:00 Tue, Mar 21, 2023 6:00 PM 18:00\nTHE COTTAGE AT NORTHGATE (map)\nGoogle Calendar ICS\n*for Network clinicians only\nJoin us at THE COTTAGE AT NORTHGATE \n\nEARN UP TO 15.75 CEU’S \n\nEarn CEU’s for Addictions, SW, Nursing, & LPC \n\nSPACE IS LIMITED!\n\nRegister Now\n\nContact Tara for questions \n\n \nView Event →\nMar\n17\n10:00 AM10:00\nGaming and Gambling Addiction in the Digital Age: Braving a New World of Addiction\nFriday, March 17, 2023\n10:00 AM 11:00 AM 10:00 11:00\nGoogle Calendar ICS\n\nONLINE ONLY\n\n1 CEU Hour Available\n\nWhen you think of problem gambling, do you imagine a smoke-filled room with cash and chips in the center of a table? Or someone pulling on a one-armed bandit? Things have changed! In the last decade, gambling has moved into the digital age.

Youth are 2-4 times more likely to develop a gambling problem than adults. There is a great overlap between Gambling Disorder and the recently categorized “Gaming Disorder” which focuses on internet use and video game play. We will discuss the highly controversial game feature of loot boxes. We will discuss the surprising results of recent surveys of youth on the issues of gaming and gambling, and the implications, especially considering the rapid expansion of “e-sports” teams in schools.\nLearning Objectives:\n1. Participant will learn how early conditioning and game design can make youth susceptible to gambling issues\n2. Participant will learn early warning signs of problem gambling/gaming in youth, problems associated with the disorder, and why prevention services for these issues are crucial\n\nSpeaker Bio: Sheila Moran\n\nSheila is Director of Communications and Marketing for First Choice Services (FCS), a West-Virginia based non-profit that operates 16 helplines, most of which focus on behavioral health.

We’ve provided crisis counseling, treatment, and resources to people experiencing gambling problems and offered support and guidance to their families. All our services are free, and our helpline coordinators are available 24/7.\n\nAdditionally, we have extensive outreach and prevention efforts.  This includes media campaigns, literature distribution, educational workshops, and sponsorship of prevention activities across the state. \n\nWe are an accredited provider of continuing education units and offer mental health and social service professionals a range of training, from short introductory courses to extensive courses that allow them to become part of our treatment network.\n\n \n\nWHAT IS A GAMBLING PROBLEM?\n\nGambling takes many forms, but it’s always about taking chances. There’s typically money or other possessions on the line, and whether it’s the lottery, slots, or cards – winning or losing is always random.\n\nProblem gambling – or gambling addiction – involves the compulsion to take chances that are capable of damaging personal, family, or vocational pursuits. Unfortunately, the loved ones of the gambler are often affected as much as the gambler. It’s estimated that between 4 and 6 million Americans can be considered as having a gambling problem. For each of these, there is a family who is also suffering."
