First, let's answer the question: What is Prompting? Prompting is a way of communicating your vision to the Kaiber AI, which will use your prompt as a guide.\n\n \n\nLearn from Your Inspiration\n\nTake a look at Kaiber‚Äôs Gallery for inspiration. You can even create using other users‚Äô prompts! Another good practice is to analyze famous artwork and break it down. What is the subject? What is the lighting like? How would you describe the setting?\n\n \n\nFor example, Georges Seurat‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Sunday on La Grande Jatte‚Äù could be described as:\n\nRelaxing Parisians, dressed in mid-19th century clothing, are depicted on a sunny day in a lush green park with several trees. A small lake is visible in the upper right corner, and white sailboats can be seen in the distance. The oil painting is done in a pointillism style by Georges Seurat.\n\n \n\nNow you can use the description to help create your prompt!\n\n \n\nA Helpful Structure for Prompts\n\nA good place to start writing a well-crafted prompt is following this general 5-step structure:\n\n \n\n01. Subject\n\nWhat is the primary focus?\n\nie: Parisians, white sailboats, small monkey, pet dogs.\n\n \n\n02. Prepositional Details and Descriptors\n\nProvide further details about the subject, including medium, additional details, and color that describe its appearance or features.\n\nie: oil painting, dark green.\n\n \n\n03. Action\n\nDescribe what the subject is doing using verbs and adverbs.\n\nie: relaxing, sitting, fishing.\n\n \n\n04. Setting\n\nProvide information about the backdrop or setting of the scene.\n\nie: lush green park, small lake, several trees.\n\n \n\n05. Meta Modifiers and Styling\n\nAdd any finishing touches to the description that affect the feel or appearance of the image or scene.\n\nie: partially sunlit, pointillism, in the style of Georges Seurat.\n\n \n\nüí° To keep your writing brief, it's best to avoid copying big chunks of text from books or giving lengthy descriptions of emotions.\n\n \n\nIterating Your Prompts\n\nPrompting, like other creative outlets, requires experimentation and several iterations. Adding more keywords can help narrow the sampling space and make the output more specific. To improve your prompt, add no more than two additional keywords with each iteration. This will help you assess how each added keyword affects your output.\n\n \n\n \n\nLet's use the description of Seurat's painting as an example for iteration!\nPrompt 1:\n\nrelaxing and sitting parisians, carrying parasols, white sailboats, small monkey, dogs, oil painting, mid-19th century clothing, in lush green park, pointillism, in style of Georges Seurat\n\n \n\nResult: This first iteration includes a lot of the aspects of the original artwork, though let's focus more on the human subjects by removing dogs and small monkey from the prompt. \n\nPrompt 2:\n\nrelaxing and sitting parisians, carrying parasols, white sailboats, oil painting, mid-19th century clothing, in lush green park, pointillism, in style of Georges Seurat\n\n \n\nResult: This second iteration focuses more on the human subjects but also on the parasols, so let's de-emphasize the parasols. Let's also add the dogs back in-- like the original painting.\n\nüí° You can emphasize and de-emphasize certain words or phrases using brackets and weighting, which you can read about here.\n\nFinal Prompt:\n\nrelaxing and sitting parisians, (carrying parasols:0.25), white sailboats, oil painting, mid-19th century clothing, in lush green park, (pointillism), in style of Georges Seurat\n\n \n\nResult: The final version is close to what was envisioned, but feel free to continue refining your own work until it's exactly the way you want it. Remember to describe the scene in a way that the AI can understand while still letting your personal style shine through.\n\n \n\nDid this answer your question?\nüòûüòêüòÉ"

It's a great way to get started and learn the ropes.\n\n \n\nUnderstanding Weighted Prompts in AI\n\nWhen it comes to artificial intelligence, prompts are important in helping models produce the desired results. As AI systems get better, users can interact with these models in more advanced ways. One way this is happening is through the use of importance scales and weighted prompts. But what are these scales exactly, and how do they change the way AI models respond to inputs?\n\n \n\nUnderstanding the Baseline\n\nTo make things easier to understand, let's talk about a starting point. When you create a prompt, each word has the same weight of 1.0. This means that the AI model sees all the words as equally important. But, if you want to highlight some words as more important or less important, you can adjust their weight using the importance scale. This will change how the AI model perceives each word compared to the starting point.\n\n \n\nUnraveling the Importance Scale\n\nThe importance scale is a system that lets users rank the significance of words or phrases in a prompt. By using the scale, users can indicate which parts of their input should receive more attention than others.\n\n \n\nThink of it like a scale where words or phrases are assigned values based on how important they are. Words with higher values are considered more significant and receive more attention from the model, while those with lower values receive less attention accordingly.\n\n \n\nHow to Assign Importance \n\nTo make Kaiber and other AI models interact better with certain parts of a prompt, users can use weights. Weights are multipliers that show how much importance a model should give to a specific word or phrase. Here is a quick breakdown on how to use these weights:\n\nA (word): If you put a word in one set of parentheses, the model will pay more attention to it, about 1.1 times more. This makes the word a bit more important in the model's calculations, but not by too much.\n\na ((word)): Double parentheses increase the emphasis on the word. The attention to the word is increased by a factor of 1.21, which is essentially 1.1 multiplied by itself.\n\na (word:1.5): Specifying a factor directly gives better control. It makes the attention to the word \"word\" 1.5 times stronger.\n\na (word:0.25): Using a factor below 1 lets users decrease how much the model pays attention to a word. In this case, the attention is decreased by a factor of 4, which is the reciprocal of 0.25.\n\nThe Implications of Using an Importance Scale\n\nThis scale lets users create prompts with a detailed order of importance. For example, in storytelling, you may want to make sure that the theme of \"redemption\" is more important than a small detail like \"rainy weather\". Using the importance scale, you can give this specific instruction to the AI model.\n\n \n\nExample Prompt: young girl, on top of tall skyscraper, (redemption), tears on her face, clenched fist, (rainy weather: 0.25)\n\n \n\nWeighting Strategies:\n\nTo create a clear order of importance in the prompt, assign weights. When multiple words or phrases have the same weight, the AI will treat each of them as equally important, so follow the strategy below.\n\nBegin by identifying the most important elements, give them the highest weights\n\nFrom there, systematically reduce the weight as you progress to less significant elements\n\nIf you notice something odd or uncommon in your results, it might suggest that a certain word or phrase has been given too much importance.\n\nüí° To get more consistent and reliable results, it's better to stay under a threshold of 1.8.\n\n \n\n \n\nDid this answer your question?\nüòûüòêüòÉ"

    "url": "https://intercom.help/kaiber/en/articles/7935580-how-do-kaiber-credits-work",
    "html": "Go to Kaiber\nEnglish\nEnglish\nAll Collections\nGetting Started\nHow do Kaiber credits work?\nHow do Kaiber credits work?\n\nCredits serve as the currency within the platform, allowing you to access various Kaiber features and tools.\n\nUpdated over a week ago\nWhat are credits?\n\nCredits are used in Kaiber to generate videos. One credit is equivalent to $.02 USD (based on Explorer Tier).\n\n \n\nHow many credits come with my plan?\n\nA one-time amount of 100 credits is included with a Free trial account. These credits do not expire.\n\n \n\nA monthly credit allotment is included with Explorer, Pro, and Artist plans every month or year, depending on your subscription plan. These credits roll over every month/year and never expire.\n\n \n\nMonthly credit amounts are as follows:\n\nPlan\n\n\t\n\nExplorer\n\n\t\n\nPro\n\n\t\n\nArtist\n\n\n\n\nMonthly credits\n\n\t\n\n300\n\n\t\n\n1,000\n\n\t\n\n2,500\n\n\n\n\nAnnual credits\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\t\n\n12,000\n\n\t\n\n33,333\n\nHow do I get more credits?\n\nIf you would like to purchase additional credits, users on Explorer, Pro, and Artist plans may do so by heading to Account > Credits > Select pack. Purchased credits are not available to Free account users. Credits may be purchased at a minimum of 1,000 credits ($15 USD) per purchase.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, paid subscribers can earn free credits through our Referral Program‚Äîif your friend signs up for any Kaiber account ‚Äì free trial or paid subscription ‚Äì you'll get 300 credits. Users on Free accounts cannot gain additional free credits through referrals. Learn more about the Referral Program here.\n\n \n\nDo credits expire?\n\nNo, your credits never expire, regardless of your plan.\n\n \n\nWhat are my credits worth?\n\nThe below estimated credit values are based on the Explorer Tier; the cost per credit decreases at higher subscription tiers.\n\nImage generation = free to download!\n\n1 second of Flipbook generation = 1 credit\n\n1 second of Motion generation = 4 credits\n\n1 second of Transform 1.0 generation = 5 credits\n\n1 second of Transform 2.0 generation = 6 credits\n\n1080p upscaling 10 seconds of any video = 1 credit\n\n4K upscaling 5 seconds of any video = 1 credit\n\nPlease note: all video generations are a minimum of 3 seconds.\n\n \n\nWhat does this look like in practice?\n\nTo further expand on how credits work in Kaiber, let's consider an example scenario:\n\nSuppose you want to create a 30-second video using the Transform feature and upscale it to 4K resolution. Here's how the credit calculation would look:\n\nTransform generation: Since the video length is 30 seconds, and the Transform feature costs 5 credits per second, the total cost would be 5 credits/second √ó 30 seconds = 150 credits.\n\n4K upscaling: As the video length is 30 seconds and the upscaling cost for 4K is 1 credit per 5 seconds, the total cost would be 1 credit/5 seconds √ó 30 seconds = 6 credits.\n\nIn this example, the total credit cost for the 30-second video with Transform and 4K upscaling would be 150 credits + 6 credits = 156 credits.\n\n \n\nRemember, credits are deducted from your account only when the final video appears in your Dashboard, giving you the flexibility to make adjustments or changes before using your credits.\n\nDid this answer your question?\nüòûüòêüòÉ"
