Namely, they control when they are triggered based on various user interactions. These triggers can be used by themselves, or in combination with other triggers, to yield different results. These triggers can thus be tailored to your specific content, or your specific social sharing goals. Certain triggers are more general and heavy handed, while other triggers are more subtle and target a specific subset of users. Be sure to watch the video for a detailed explanation of how these triggers can be used.\n\nTrigger Settings\nTrigger After Time Delay\n\nIf Automatic PopUps are enabled, this setting will appear, allowing you to specify the timed delay (in seconds) of your social popup.\n\nTrigger After Inactivity\n\nThis will cause the popup to appear once the user has been inactive for a certain period of time. If the user has left their computer, or left the tab after reading your post, try reminding them to share when they get back!\n\nTrigger After Scrolling\n\nThis will trigger the popup after the visitor has scrolled a certain percentage down the page. Depending on the size of your page, and the content within it, you can have the popup trigger at specific points within the reading. Depending on the situation, having the flying trigger at certain percentages may be much more effective than a timing delay.\n\nTrigger After Commenting\n\nThis is a great way to target your most engaged visitors. When this is enabled, your visitor will be greeted with a flying after they have posted a comment on your website.\n\nTrigger After Purchasing\n\nThis is another great way to target your most engaged visitors. When this is enabled, your customers will be asked to share your website after they have successfully purchased a product using WooCommerce.\n\nTrigger at Bottom of Post\n\nJust as a reader reaches the end of your page or post content is a perfect time to offer them a way to share your content. Enabling this popup trigger will auto detect the end of your content and do just that.\n\nTriggers NOTE\n\nNo matter how many triggers you have selected above, Monarch will only use whichever trigger occurs first so that your users are not overwhelmed with popups if you have multiple triggers enabled."

This dashboard can be accessed by the stats icon in top bar of the Monarch Dashboard\n\nAll-Time Stats\nTotal Shares\n\nThis number represents your all time share count across all social networks.\n\nTotal Likes\n\nUsers can also choose to simply ‘Like’ a page.

This means that, for the networks that support it, you never have to update your follower count since the plugin continually checks the API and caches the count for you. Only certain networks support API calls, and each of them need to be configured a little differently. For a full list of supported networks and their installation instructions, keep reading.\n\nBefore you can configure your API settings, you must first make sure that you have “Get Counts VIA API” enabled within the Networks tab of your Monarch settings panel. Once enabled, you can begin setting up each account as outlined below.\n\nTwitter\n\nTwitter uses OAuth for its API, which means it requires some additional authentication steps before it will allow Monarch to access your profile information. To begin the process, first log in to your Twitter.com account and then access the Application Manager. Here you will need to fill in several fields as outlined below:\n\nName\n\nThis can be anything you want. Just something to remember it by.\n\nDescription\n\nThis can be anything you want as well.\n\nWebsite\n\nThe full URL to your website (for example, http://www.yourwebsite.com).\n\nCallback URI\n\nThis setting requires a very specific URL to identify your app. The URL that must be pasted here is the URL that leads directly to the Social Follow Networks tab in the Monarch settings inside your WordPress Dashboard.

Click the “Authorize” button the complete the process. Monarch will now grab your twitter follower counts automatically.\n\nYoutube\n\nYoutube uses authorization keys for its API, which means it requires some additional authentication steps before it will allow Monarch to access your subscriber count. First, input the ID of your channel into the “name” field within the Monarch networks tab. The channel ID can be found at the end of your channel URL. For example:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuasRuWliU48RwnKXf9GesA\n\nObtain An API Key\n\nNow, log in to your Youtube account and then access the Google Developers Console where you will create a new Project.

Click on “Continue as …” then “Ok” to complete the authorization and now Monarch will automatically grab your Facebook share and follower counts.\n\nInstagram\n\nInstragram uses OAuth for its API, which means it requires some additional authentication steps before it will allow Monarch to access your profile information.

Once you click the Authorize button, Monarch will automatically grab your Vimeo follower counts.\n\nSoundcloud\n\nSoundcloud requires two pieces of information in order to grab your follower counts via their API: Name and Client ID. To access these details, you will first need to register an app within your Soundcloud account.\n\nLog in to your Soundcloud.com account and then access the Soundcloud Apps Page to get started. Click the “Register A New Application” button to begin the app creation process.\nNext you will be asked to fill in the following information:\n\nName\n\nThis can be anything you like.\n\nWebsite of your app\n\nInput the full URL to your website, such as: http://www.yourwebsite.com\n\nRedirect URL\n\nThis setting requires a very specific URL to identify your app. The URL that must be pasted here is the URL that leads directly to the Social Follow Networks tab in the Monarch settings inside your WordPress Dashboard. To get this URL, log in to your WordPress Dashboard and click Tools > Monarch Settings> Social Follow > Networks and then copy and past the URL from your address bar. It will look something like this: http://www.yourwebsite.com/wp-admin/tools.php?page=et_monarch_options#tab_et_social_tab_content_follow_networks\n\nClick the “Save App” button. After your application has been saved, copy and paste the “Client ID” (which will be listed on the app page your are currently on) and your SoundCloud Username into the SoundCloud API settings within the Networks tab of your Monarch settings panel. Monarch will now grab your follower counts automatically.\n\nGithub\n\nGithub makes it easy to grab your follower counts. All you need to do is input your Github username into the Github “Name” field within the Networks tab of your Monarch settings panel.\n\nVK\n\nBefore you can configure VK, you first need to figure out your User ID, which is actually different than the VK username you use when logging in. To access this User ID, log in to VK and then go to the Account Settings page. Scroll down and look for the “Your Profile ID” section, and then copy and paste your Profile ID into the “User ID” field within the VK API settings inside the Network tab of your Monarch settings panel."

The dashboard breaks your networks setup into two different locations: Sharing and Following, which are described in detail below.\n\nSocial Sharing: Manage Networks\n\nAdd Networks\n\nClicking this button will bring up a modal window of all available social sharing networks. From here you can select networks, deselect networks, and see networks that you may have already had selected. Applying your selections will update your networks list.\n\nArranging Networks\n\nArranging your networks into a specific order is as easy as dragging and dropping.\n\nNetwork Label\n\nBy default, Monarch uses the network names as the button labels, but you can type in whatever label you would like. For example, you may want to use labels such as “Tweet This” “Share This” or “Pin This” instead of using network names.\n\nTwitter Handle\n\nIf Twitter is added to your list, you can input your Twitter handle so that when people tweet a page, your Handle is automatically inserted to their tweet text.\n\nSocial Follow: Manage Networks\n\nAdd Networks\n\nClicking this button will bring up a modal window of all available social following networks. From here you can select networks, deselect networks, and see networks that you may have already had selected.

For example, you may want to use labels such as “Follow Us” or “Subscribe” instead of using network names.\n\nProfile URL\n\nThis link allows Monarch to link out to your social profiles when a visitor clicks on a social follow button.\n\nFollow Count\n\nIn theses fields you can input your follow counts. Most networks require that you manually input and update these numbers, but in the display setting below, you can enable API counts for select networks.\n\nSocial Follow: Display Settings\nGet Counts Via API\n\nChecking this will enable all networks that have a follow count API to dynamically display your follow counts. To learn how to set these up, see the Network API Documentation.\n\nOpen Link in New Window\n\nThis option lets you define whether or not you want your social profile to open up in an new browser window."

Newcomers, start here!\n\nWhat Is Monarch?\n\nMonarch is a Social Sharing and Social Following plugin built to get you more share and more followers on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. Monarch does this by using various different social sharing integration methods, such as social sharing sidebars, inline sharing buttons, popups and flyin boxes. By encouraging your visitors to share, and making it easy for them to share, Monarch can greatly increase the social sharing activity on your website. In addition, Monarch also helps you get more followers on such social networks by making it easy to link out to your social profiles and display your social follower count. Monarch excels by giving your more effective social sharing methods, and by giving you in-depth design customization options and statistics.\n\nUsing Monarch’s Social Sharing Locations\n\nMonarch’s social sharing methods are broken up into different integration “locations.” These locations can be enabled, disabled and customization using the Monarch settings dashboard. Monarch comes with 5 different social sharing locations: Sidebar, Inline, Flyin, Popup and Media. Each of these different locations grabs your visitor’s attention in different ways, giving you a variety of tools for promoting sharing activity on your website.\n\nSidebar\n\nThe floating sidebar is a great way to promote sharing across your entire website. The sidebar places floating buttons on the left side of the screen that follow the visitor as they scroll, giving them an easy way to share no matter where they are on the page. These buttons also break down on mobile devices into a sliding toggle the improve user experience. If you are only going to enabled a single sharing location on your website, then the floating sidebar in a great choice. Read The Full Tutorial\n\nInline\n\nInline sharing buttons are the most basic of the 5 sharing locations. Enabling this location will place sharing buttons above or below your post content, giving your readers an easy way to share before and after they finish reading your article. If you are looking for the simplest and cleanest way to add social sharing to your website, then the Inline location is a great choice. Read The Full Tutorial\n\nFlyin\n\nThe flying box is a unique and highly effective method of social sharing, and it’s highly customizable as well. The flyin box will slide up from the bottom of the page, giving your visitor a clear queue to share. Furthermore, these flyin boxes can be triggered based on different user interactions, such as: timing delay, when a visitor reacher the bottom of a post, or when a visitor is leaving a page. Using these triggers give you a unique opportunity to capture lost shares and promote sharing from your most engaged visitors. Read The Full Tutorial\n\nPopup\n\nPopups are perhaps the most effective integration area available in monarch. Nothing grabs your visitors attention quite like a popup, and you can be sure that your visitors get the message when popups are enabled. What’s more, these popups (much like the flyin), can be triggered based on different user interactions. This gives you control over exactly how popups are displayed, and what types of visitors they are displayed to. For example, a popup might only be displayed when a visitor finishes reading your post – the optimum moment to ask a visitor to share your page. If you are looking to really boost shares on your site, then the popup is a great option. Read The Full Tutorial\n\nMedia\n\nMedia sharing automatically adds sharing buttons on hover to all the images in your post, or to certain images that you selecting using the Media shortcode. This is great for photo-centric networks such as Pinterest or Tumblr, and it gives you visitors an easy way to share the beautiful images within your blog posts. If you run a photography or art blog, then this integration location is the perfect way to engage with your visitors and promote more sharing activity. Read The Full Tutorial\n\nUsing Monarch’s Social Following Locations\n\nSocial following differs slightly from the Social Sharing methods we have covered so far. Instead of promoting the sharing of your individual posts from your visitors to their friends, the social follow portion of Monarch seeks to gain you more followers on your own online social profiles. For example, if you have a Facebook page for your business, you can use Monarch to advertise that profile page and encourage visitors to follow you. You can also display your social follower counts for each network, giving your visitors social proof about how popular your are. Social follow buttons can be displayed using two different methods: Widgets and Shortcodes.\n\nWidget\n\nThe social follow widget in Monarch allows you to place links to your online social profiles and display the follower counts from those profiles within your sidebar or any other widget-ready area on your website. Placing large enticing social follower buttons at the top of your blog’s sidebar is a great way to get more followers, and to show off how many people are already following you. Read The Full Tutorial\n\nShortcode\n\nThe social follow shortcode can be used to display social profile links and social profile counts anywhere on your website. Using Monarch’s shortcode generator, you can build your own customized shortcodes and then paste those shortcodes in your posts or pages to display your follower buttons. Shortcodes are the perfect way to display social follow buttons anyway – you can even place them within a custom text widget in Divi! Read The Full Tutorial"
