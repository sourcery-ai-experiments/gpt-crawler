Great artists steal”\n\nYa, Steve actually stole from the artist who said that quote – Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno María de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso.\n\nAka Pablo Picasso.\n\nSee Steve Jobs copied Picasso to make Apple $350 billion.\n\nHere’s how…\n\nSo, it’s Spain, 1945.\n\nWe’re in the studio of the great artist himself.\n\nSay hi, Picasso.\n\nUhhh close enough…it’s his second language.\n\nNow like every honorable Spaniard, Picasso’s obsessed with 1 thing: bullfighting.\n\nSo he spends his days studying this graceful beast:\n\nHe watches it\nHe touches it\nHe tastes it\n\nMaybe not taste…but he gets to the animal’s inner beauty in ways we never have.\n\nSo he sets out to capture it – stripping away its features one by one.\n\nFirst the hair.\n\nThen the skin.\n\nThen the organs.\n\n‘Til after 11 iterations he’s left with just this…\n\nJust kidding lol. It looked like this.\n\nPicasso simplifies the complex structure of a bull until it’s just — lines!\n\nThe ~essence~ of a bull.\n\nAnd, of course, this masterpiece catches the eye of another animal – Steve Jobs.\n\nThe human turtleneck falls in love.\n\nIn fact, Steve is so in love he builds a school around it – APPLE UNIVERSITY.\n\nA place to study Picasso’s bull.\n\nAnd make sure just ~The Essence~ was at the forefront of all Apple design.\n\nLike simplifying Apple’s mouse to a trackpad.\n\nSo…thanks for stealing Steve :)\n\nMORE POSTS FOR YOU ❤️\nWhy Is Caviar So Expensive? 🪺\nHow Does a Vacuum Work? 💨\nWhat’s Inside a Beehive? 🐝\nSee all posts ->\nGet smart about nonsense🌈\n\nJoin 30,000+ subscribers and get our daily comic explaining nerdy stuff like you’re 5.\n\nPowered by\nDemandFlow"

Because we’re dummies…and we tend to mess stuff up. So his job is to dummy-proof us.\n\nNow, he might be a genius — but let me break down his master strategy in 2 drawings.\n\nHow Elon sees the world:\n\nYa, that’s it.\n\nBut there’s only 1 problem.\n\nThat backup Earth aka Mars is really f*cking far away.\n\nLike spend-a-year-flying-super-fast-in-space-to-get-there far. Sucky.\n\nOh wait.\n\nI forgot, there’s actually 2 problems.\n\nEarth is really f*cking big.\n\nWhich means it’s chock-full of humans. So we need a serious space ship to get us to Mars.\n\nOr for us math nerds:\n\nNow simplified:\n\nWe need a big ship.\n\nLuckily, Elon’s good at multitasking cars, tweets, and space — so he gets to work.\n\nElon calls it STARSHIP.\n\nDamn.\n\nElon slaps his old Starship on top of his new beast – Starship Super Thicc.\n\nNo, wait they’re telling me that’s not the name and to grow up.\n\nIt’s actually Starship Super Heavy.\n\nLess fun, but this heavy hog is still the most powerful rocket ever built.\n\nYou want the specs?\n\n394 feet tall – like a football field but up\n32 Raptor engines – the most powerful rocket engines in history\n100 ton payload – the weight of 1 statue of liberty or 1,000 plump adults\n\nHow’s that stack up against the greats?\n\nYa, Starship is also the biggest rocket ever.\n\nOh and did I say it’s fully reusable?\n\nThis would drop the price to send payloads to orbit by 2 orders of magnitude – from $10,000/kg on Saturn V to $100/kg on Super Thicc.\n\nTranslation: Space shipping & handling is basically FREE.\n\nBONKERS.\n\nBut this is great in theory.\n\nNow we gotta…you know…put it to practice.\n\nYa, it blew up.\n\nBummer. But that’s SCIENCE 🌈\n\nIt’d be great if we could send humanity to Mars in one go and not have everyone explode like human fireworks.\n\nBUT…new & groundbreaking technology always has its kinks.\n\nLook at the Wright brothers.\n\nIn 1908, Orville crashed their Wright Flyer into a photographer and killed him instantly.\n\nOr – less morbidly – Edison.\n\nHe tried 6,000 different materials for his lightbulb before finding the one that worked. Plus, he didn’t even invent the lightbulb, dammit.\n\nOr Einstein.\n\nThe clown didn’t even believe black holes existed.\n\nScience is full of mistakes – remember trial and error?\n\nSo Elon, hats off for the trial and the error.\n\nMars, enjoy your last few years in peace.\n\nWe’re coming in hot.\n\nCrush Ass,\nDylan & Henry 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nYou’re still here!?

Classics.\n\nBut in 1968, Dr. Silver spends his days developing that ~OOEY GOOEY~ for 3M — adhesives.\n\nNow, Silver’s goal is to create an adhesive that can be used to literally hold airplanes together.\n\nLike the STICKIEST, most PERMANENT sh*t in manufacturing.\n\nBut he keeps coming up with formulas that stick well to a surface, then can be peeled off and reused.\n\nPolar opposite situation.\n\nSo Silver starts doing these lectures at 3M to show colleagues his not-so-sticky glue.\n\nAnd this colleague Art Fry gets curious.\n\nArt Fry was in 3M’s tape division — and wants to create a new product.\n\nSo the two buddy up.\n\nBut, they didn’t have any ideas. Remember Silver invented a glue THAT WASN’T VERY GLUE-Y.\n\nUntil one Sunday, Art’s going to church.\n\nAnd when he sits down in the pew he notices a problem: The slips of paper Fry is using as bookmarks in his hymnal?\n\nThey keep falling out.\n\nPlus his hymnal pages tear like tissue paper when he’s trying to bust out a verse of ‘How Great Thou Art’.\n\nFry needs a gentle bookmark solution, and Dr. Silver accidentally has one 💦\n\nSo in 1993 they patent the “repositionable pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet material.”\n\nThe post-it note:\n\nAnd today they’re just another great reminder of our inability to get anything meaningful done.\n\nStay cute,\nHenry & Dylan 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nWhat the heck, leave 😂 or click to watch the Post-It Note video 👇\n\n‍\n\nMORE POSTS FOR YOU ❤️\nWhy Is Caviar So Expensive? 🪺\nHow Does a Vacuum Work? 💨\nWhat’s Inside a Beehive? 🐝\nSee all posts ->\nGet smart about nonsense🌈\n\nJoin 30,000+ subscribers and get our daily comic explaining nerdy stuff like you’re 5.\n\nPowered by\nDemandFlow"

At this car show in Manchester, England:\n\nYes, there were dozens, hundreds, maybe even thousands of people there.\n\nBut we really only care about two of them.\n\nThese two:\n\nHang on. They’re not friends yet.\n\nOkay, good boys.\n\nHenry, you can go say ‘hi’ to Charles now.\n\nCharles Rolls and Henry Royce totally hit it off just like that ☝️\n\nAnd they join forces to manufacture the ~best car in the world~\n\nBut the first year, they just bicker about performance versus drivability and stuff.\n\nUntil finally they compromise and create this absolute banger — The Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost:\n\nDope car.\n\nDoper mustaches.\n\nBut seriously, check out Ghost’s specs:\n\nTop speed: 60 mph\nHorsepower: 48\nDurability: 14,371 miles without an involuntary stop — 1907 world record.\n\nPlus it rides silent like a ~ghost~\n\nOkay, so we agree they’re making a sweet car.\n\nBut they run into a small problem…..World War I.\n\nSee in the war, the British government prints posters like this:\n\nSee that? The last, totally real flyer? Look at the chicken scratch at the bottom.\n\nThe Brits need airplane help.\n\nAnd guess who knows a thing or two about building engines…Charles Rolls & Henry Royce 😏\n\nPlus they also know a juicy, Government-subsidized-business-opportunity when they see one.\n\nSo they build this hog:\n\nThey call it The Eagle.\n\nA 350 horsepower, water-cooled engine that hauled ass — like enough ass to fly the first airplane across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAnd this engine gave the British a huge advantage over the Germans in WWI.\n\nIt was so good, in fact, I’m pretty sure it’s the reason Britain won the war.\n\nBut don’t quote me on that. You can quote me on the rest.\n\nNow you know! If you’re ever slammed into a bus to drive 10 feet to board your airplane, well…\n\nTake a peek. There’s an 18% chance your plane’s engines are the product of 1914 British patriotism 🇬🇧\n\nStay Cute,\nHenry & Dylan 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\n\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nI guess this begs the question ‘what about Rolls-Royce cars??’ Click below to watch 👇\n\n‍\n\nMORE POSTS FOR YOU ❤️\nWhy Is Caviar So Expensive? 🪺\nHow Does a Vacuum Work? 💨\nWhat’s Inside a Beehive? 🐝\nSee all posts ->\nGet smart about nonsense🌈\n\nJoin 30,000+ subscribers and get our daily comic explaining nerdy stuff like you’re 5.\n\nPowered by\nDemandFlow"

    "html": "Home\nAll posts\n💉Chemo is WWI Mustard Gas\n💉Chemo is WWI Mustard Gas\n\nThis is Steve Jobs.\n\nActually, this is him.\n\nHe’s dead.\n\nMost people think he died from pancreatic cancer.\n\nBut they’re wrong.\n\nHe died from this…\n\nApples.\n\nSeriously.\n\nHe was hippy dippy – so his treatment was fruit fasts, hot baths, and acupuncture.\n\nBasically, everything but what actually works: chemotherapy.\n\nBut he was right to be freaked out – because chemo’s origin was deadly. It was invented from WWI mustard gas.\n\nIt’s crazy…\n\nSo it’s 1917, The Western Front:\n\nYa, that’s mustard gas.\n\nThe British first synthesized it in the lab in 1860 – but it was always just for shits. Well, until those pesky Germans ruin it (like everything else).\n\nBecause in WWI, the Germans are sick of the deadlocked trench warfare.\n\nSo they shake things up a bit – by turning Mustard Gas into a SUPER effective chemical weapon.\n\nHere’s why it works:\n\nCheap – Perfect for a resource-strapped Germany at the end of the war.\nEasy – You just need sulfur, chlorine, nitrogen, and basic equipment to make it.\nPotent – The gas lingers for 1-2 days normally, but up to weeks in the cold.\n\nThis means you’d have to evacuate your trenches.\n\nBecause if you don’t evacuate or mask up, you’ll end up like this…\n\nMustard Gas causes your eyes to burn, your skin to blister, and you to suffocate.\n\n100,000 soldiers die like that 👆\n\nSo with every soldier…you know…dying…American scientists look for an antidote.\n\nBut they discover something odd.\n\nThe bone marrow from gas victims…it stopped making blood cells.\n\nYou’re probably thinking: Bone marrow? Whoopty doo. Tell me something interesting.\n\nWell, how about you listen dammit.\n\nBecause bone marrow cells are similar to another cell – CANCER. They both divide like crazy.\n\nSo they get an idea…\n\nHe gasses ‘em.\n\nJust kidding — they’re American, not German.\n\nSo instead of huckin’ gas canisters at the cancer victims, the scientists inject them with different mustard gas compounds.\n\nThen – true to the trial & error of science 🌈 – they check which ones work.\n\nThey find a drug that works. Yippeee 🥳\n\nBut how’s chemo actually work?\n\nWell, when a cell divides, it exposes its DNA.\n\nWhich chemo beats to a pulp.\n\nNow this DNA pulping hurts ALL cells – but mortally wounds those quickly dividing ones that don’t have time to repair.\n\nAka cancer…and hair, stomach, and genital cells. Which is why during chemo you go bald, puke, and stop wanting to fugg 🍆\n\nSo what’s the lesson?\n\nDon’t get cancer.\n\nBut if you do, thank these fine folks for giving you a fighting chance.\n\nCrush Ass,\nDylan & Henry 🌈\n\nP.S f you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\n\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe HERE.\n\nP.P.S Click below to watch the video 😉👇\n\nWATCH THIS GEM\n\n‍\n\nMORE POSTS FOR YOU ❤️\nWhy Is Caviar So Expensive? 🪺\nHow Does a Vacuum Work? 💨\nWhat’s Inside a Beehive? 🐝\nSee all posts ->\nGet smart about nonsense🌈\n\nJoin 30,000+ subscribers and get our daily comic explaining nerdy stuff like you’re 5.\n\nPowered by\nDemandFlow"

You’re not gonna stick your finger in there and fish it out…are you?\n\nOh my god no, you did.\n\nThat’s embarrassing.\n\nIt’s a problem as old as the Frito itself – The United States’ oldest corn chip.\n\nSo how’d we get into this mess?\n\nWell, it was the 1930s and this dude Charles Doolin was working at a confectionery:\n\nOops!

He has an idea.\n\nSee, look:\n\nSo Charles opens up a Fritos Mexican restaurant inside of DisneyLand. Casa De Fritos – Authentic Mexican Food.\n\nHmmmm looks real authentic.\n\nAnyway, the restaurants actually doing great.\n\nJust look at those smiles:\n\nWhat isn’t going so great is the fact that this place is still run by gringos in Disneyland.\n\nJust look at the dumpster at this place:\n\nYa, I know!\n\nA dumpster full of perfectly good tortillas. The restaurant just didn’t know what to do with the extras, so they threw them out.\n\nSo Casa De Fritos starts taking all their thrown out tortillas, cutting them into triangles, and frying them up into tortilla chips.\n\nThey use their own unique blend of seasoning and start serving them to customers.\n\nLow and behold, the customers LOVE THEM.\n\nOh and I forgot to tell you: at this point, the Frito Company merged with H.W. Lay to become Frito-Lay.\n\nThis is their chip lineup:\n\nOkay and the new Frito-Lay has this marketing dude on their team, Arch West.\n\nAnd Arch West comes romping his way into Casa De Fritos looking for the new tortilla chip product he had been hearing about at corporate.\n\nHe takes one sniff of the tortilla chips:\n\nA hush falls over the room..\n\nThen a bite..\n\nWhat do you wanna call it, Arch?\n\nOkay, oddly specific…\n\nOh, that actually makes sense. Nice.\n\nAnd any problem with this little piece of gold?\n\nAnd?\n\nOh.\n\nThat checks out. Because outside of the Southwest in the 1960s, nobody ate tortilla chips with salsa or guac.\n\nJust look:\n\nGreen = tortilla chip eaters.\n\nRed = no tortilla chip eaters.\n\nSo Arch West has this brilliant idea to just season these new Doritos like a taco.\n\nCause whiteys at least know what a taco is.\n\nSo Frito-Lay rolls out these bad boys:\n\nWhat would become the biggest tortilla chip IN THE WORLD.\n\nAnd look at you! You learned that Doritos were invented from Disneyland trash and they’re kind of the reason you get a basket of complimentary tortilla chips at Los Pollos Hermanos in..ya know…Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nI’m so proud of you 🥹\n\nStay Cute,\nHenry & Dylan 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nWATCH DORITOS\n\n‍\n\nMORE POSTS FOR YOU ❤️\nWhy Is Caviar So Expensive? 🪺\nHow Does a Vacuum Work? 💨\nWhat’s Inside a Beehive? 🐝\nSee all posts ->\nGet smart about nonsense🌈\n\nJoin 30,000+ subscribers and get our daily comic explaining nerdy stuff like you’re 5.\n\nPowered by\nDemandFlow"

I meant this:\n\nYou see that?\n\nIt has the dreaded BUTTON FLY.\n\nIs this button fly a first world problem?\n\nSure.\n\nDo I care?\n\nNo. These things SUCKED for quickly getting your privates back into safety.\n\nEspecially with all of those middle school hormones flying around.\n\nSo I went down a rabbit hole for us to figure out how we got zippers in the first place.\n\nThe quest starts in 1893 with this guy from Chicago.\n\nGuess his super Chicago name..\n\nCome on, just do it!!\n\nWrong.\n\nSay ‘hi’ to Whitcomb Judson.\n\nAnd Whitcomb – oh my god I can’t with that name – Whitcomb’s got a good friend with a not-so-good back.\n\nSo Whitcomb decides there must be a better way to fasten shoes. Especially for the frail, stale, and old.\n\nHe hits right back with this classic, crooked text 1893 patent:\n\nThe “Clasp Locker Or Unlocker For Shoes.”\n\nI get it was 1893 and all, but, Whitcomb, did you really have to come up with such a ridiculous name?\n\nRight.\n\nSo this was cool. We had a patent for the first zipper-y thing but it was really just too complicated.\n\nIt used a hook and eye fastener system to “zip” things shut, but it got jammed all the time.\n\nLucky for Whitcomb – omg… – he had a whole zipper factory at this point.\n\nSo his head designer – Gideon Sundback – sits him down.\n\nAnd together they had invented a new, simpler zipper!\n\nThe separable fastener.\n\nIt was cheaper, more durable, and easier to use than Whitcomb’s original clasp locker or unlocker.\n\nSo cheap and durable and easy, in fact, the US started using Gideon’s zippers in all of their WWII uniforms.\n\nAfter the war, Levi’s added the first zipper to their jeans which started a zipper fly movement.\n\nAnd today we have nobody to thank but Whitcomb and Gideon for their sacrifice to help make button flys a remnant of the past.\n\nStay Cute,\nHenry & Dylan 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nP.P.S Click below to watch the zipper video 👇\n\nWATCH ZIPPER\n\n‍\n\nMORE POSTS FOR YOU ❤️\nWhy Is Caviar So Expensive? 🪺\nHow Does a Vacuum Work? 💨\nWhat’s Inside a Beehive? 🐝\nSee all posts ->\nGet smart about nonsense🌈\n\nJoin 30,000+ subscribers and get our daily comic explaining nerdy stuff like you’re 5.\n\nPowered by\nDemandFlow"

Dribble.\n\nThe year was 1908. This dude Marquis Converse is selling his rubber boots in the rainy streets of Boston.\n\nWith his limited sales, Marquis opens the Converse Rubber Company. They specialize in all kinds of things that have tons to do with basketball.\n\nThings like galoshes and car tires.\n\nBut Marquis wants to be a part of something bigger.\n\nSomething grander.\n\nSomething so manly he can go to all of his manly man friends and once and for all say ‘I’m the man.’\n\nSomething like…\n\nBASKETBALL!\n\nPause.\n\nThat’s what they wore back then??! Knee pads?\n\nAnd oh, I’m sorry…is that a free throw you’re also UNDERHAND-GRANNY-THROWING?!\n\nNot to worry, Basketball surely has something to make up for all that.\n\nAh, yes. The humble 1910 basketball referee. Perfectly suited for a first-class voyage on the RMS Titanic.\n\nAnyway, all of that barely passes for basketball now, but basketball shoes at the time looked like this:\n\nHmm semi-familiar, okay.\n\nMarquis wants to compete.\n\nWith his rubber company, he launches a shoe specifically for basketball: The Converse Non-Skid.\n\nExcuse me?? The bottom of the ad. A suction sole shoe… You mean a mini plunger shoe? That’s insane, but we gotta plow on…\n\nHere’s the shoe in real life:\n\nOkay, great.\n\nSmall problem though: Marquis doesn’t really have a good way to sell his new shoes.\n\nSo he starts scouting basketball players in small, independent basketball leagues across the midwest.\n\nThe two team up in 1923 so Chuck can be the shoe company’s salesman and brand ambassador.\n\nHe’d prance around high schools and colleges running basketball clinics promoting Converse’s non-skid All-star shoes.\n\nHe’s so good, actually, Converse and Chuck Taylor become one and the same.\n\nAnd the shoes are so good they’re pretty much the same basketball shoe 100 years later.\n\nStay Cute,\nHenry & Dylan 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\n‍\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nP.P.S Click below to watch the Converse video 👇\n\nWATCH CONVERSE\n\n‍\n\nMORE POSTS FOR YOU ❤️\nWhy Is Caviar So Expensive? 🪺\nHow Does a Vacuum Work? 💨\nWhat’s Inside a Beehive? 🐝\nSee all posts ->\nGet smart about nonsense🌈\n\nJoin 30,000+ subscribers and get our daily comic explaining nerdy stuff like you’re 5.\n\nPowered by\nDemandFlow"

    "html": "Home\nAll posts\n🦧 How Humans Lost Our Fur\n🦧 How Humans Lost Our Fur\n\nHey you naked chimp,\n\nYou ever look at an actual chimp?\n\nI mean really look at it?\n\nSee the difference?\n\nChimps are COVERED IN FUR – but why are humans naked?\n\nWell let’s go back in time...like really far back…like 400 million years ago back.\n\nWe got this jacked, horny fish:\n\nHe crawls out the damn water.\n\nAnd for 200 million years his stud offspring keep crawling. And eventually their scales evolve into hair.\n\n(Don’t ask me how – tbh evolution is so wild, I get why religious fundamentalists think we're nuts.)\n\nBut whatever, we end up with this…\n\nA Chinese squirrel thing:\n\nIt’s the first mammal.\n\nNow hair is sick because it’s like sunblock, armor, and a blanket wrapped in one. Meaning mammals can stay safe during the day and warm at night.\n\nBut that’s a problem for us mammals in the African savanna.\n\nSee let’s look at this early hominid – a half ape, half human called Lucy.\n\nShit my bad, Lucy. Alive she actually looked like this…\n\nBut around then, we started hanging down here…\n\nBecause now we could do this…\n\nWith these…\n\nWhich makes us want to go after these…\n\nBut there’s a problem….\n\nOr actually more like 3…\n\nSo after a few minutes of chasing, you end up like this…\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause you overheat.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause to run, you move your body. To move your body, you contract your muscles. To contract your muscles, you break down ATP. To break down ATP, you release HEAT.\n\nBut if you release too much heat, your brain sets off a fire alarm.\n\nWhich activates your sweat sprinklers – especially on your hands, head, and feet – because sweat cools you down.\n\nWhy?\n\nDamn, you figure it out. I’m not Google. I’m a free f*cking email.\n\nWhatever.\n\nIt’s because sweat trickles onto your hot skin. But hot just means things jiggling fast. So your fast jiggling skin molecules slam into the water molecules, sending them flying into the air – they evaporate.\n\nNow, you’re just left with slower molecules – aka you cool down.\n\nWhich is all fine & dandy if you can sweat…but hair keeps your sweat TRAPPED.\n\nSo after 2 minutes you’re back here…\n\nOh shit.\n\nSee less hairy chimp-humans hunt better – which means they survive, bang, and pass on their less hairy genes better too.\n\nSo over millions of years humans evolve to have 10x the sweat glands as chimps and much finer hair – though we still have the same number of hairs as chimps.\n\nBut what about our hair here?\n\nHead\nArmpit\nCrotch\n\nWell, that hair is still useful.\n\nHead hair is a good sunhat & helmet.\n\nAnd armpit hair and pubes reduce friction when running…and fuggin 😉\n\nGo evolution 🚀\n\nCrush Ass,\nDylan & Henry 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nP.P.S Click below to watch the vid 👇\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\n‍\n\nMORE POSTS FOR YOU ❤️\nWhy Is Caviar So Expensive? 🪺\nHow Does a Vacuum Work? 💨\nWhat’s Inside a Beehive? 🐝\nSee all posts ->\nGet smart about nonsense🌈\n\nJoin 30,000+ subscribers and get our daily comic explaining nerdy stuff like you’re 5.\n\nPowered by\nDemandFlow"

    "html": "Home\nAll posts\n💾 The Invention of Google\n💾 The Invention of Google\n\nGood morning Googly Eyes!\n\nI think we’re all fairly familiar with the fact that Google was named after the mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeroes.\n\nA googol.\n\nHere’s the number 1:\n\nHere’s a googol:\n\nI know what you’re thinking.\n\nThat illustrated number doesn’t actually look that big.\n\nYou’re right.\n\n‍\nBut it is. Trust me.\n\nIf you’ll humor me for just one second..\n\n\nThe number of atoms in the observable universe is about 1080.\n\nThe number of atoms!!\n\nA googol is STILL 1020 TIMES LARGER. That’s one hundred billion billion times larger for the people that like words.\n\nSo put our first observable universe on a human hair:\n\nYa but like on the cross section.\n\nThank you.\n\nOkay then this one hundred billion billion times larger number would be like a country that’s 100km wide in comparison:\n\nThat two-headed bird holding a globus cruciger (which symbolizes the ruler’s dominion over the world nbd) is Montenegro.\n\nSo human hair OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE compared to an entire funny-sounding country.\n\nThis number is so unfathomably large that…well…let’s just stop fathoming it.\n\nBecause before Google was Google, their company name was actually BackRub.\n\nIt’s an awesome story.\n\n1996. Stanford University.\n\nThere’s these two buds – Larry Page and Sergey Brin.\n\nNow unlike you and I (I’m assuming because you subscribe to a newsletter called Smart Nonsense…), these guys actually liked school.\n\nThey were so gung-ho about school, in fact, they were PhD students in computer science at the best, most computer science school in the world.\n\nNow let’s get something straight.\n\nToday when you have a question your brain doesn’t know the answer to, you Google it.\n\nOr if you’re lazy like me and can’t click a couple links, you run it through Google Bard. That minx will just spoon feed you the answers to all your problems.\n\nAre they always true?\n\nUsually never.\n\nBut hang on young gun!\n\nThe internet didn’t always work this way.\n\nIn Larry & Sergey’s day, the internet was an atrocious place to try and get your questions answered.\n\nYou were better off cracking open an Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell let's say I wanted to search the results for Bill Clinton’s 1996 election.\n\nI’d boot up my agonizingly slow IBM ThinkPad 701C:\n\nHop on a web directory – maybe Yahoo! Directory or LookSmart — to run my search:\n\nAnd get back–!\n\nLiterally nothing useful.\n\nWebsites were usually organized by category. So in this case you’d look for the “Politics” or “Government” category and then hope you stumble into a website that mentioned Bill Clinton’s election.\n\nOh wait, you found one!!\n\nToo bad it’s a random 6 year old that did a class project on Bill Clinton. Not really sure why they were learning about Monica Lewinsky, though.\n\nOkay back to 1996.\n\nLarry and Sergey are sick of this terrible internet search problem.\n\nSo they start to look for a new way to organize all of internet search lol.\n\nSomething I’ve also spent a tremendous amount of time thinking about when I get a chance.\n\nBut these smarties notice something profound…\n\nAcademia.\n\nKind of.\n\nMore like the fact that in academia, you write research papers.\n\nIf your papers are good, they get cited by other research papers.\n\nA couple links down the chain, and the best research papers have the most citations linked to them.\n\n\nYou picking up what I’m putting down?\n\nNo?\n\nRun that same algorithm on internet page links:\n\nIf a lot of people are linking to a webpage, it must be good!\n\nThat’s the basis of Google.\n\nA page citation idea stolen from academia that the guys called BackRub – a way to analyze the importance of a website based on its backlinks.\n\nThe name was kind of silly and the guys had to publish a serious PhD thesis, so they changed the name to PageRank.\n\nHere’s that original thesis:\n\nThere’s even all kinds of fancy math stuff about linking things if you’re so inclined to check that out:\n\nSo the BackRub idea became the PageRank thesis.\n\nAnd when Larry and Sergey dropped out of Stanford, the PageRank thesis became Google.\n\nAnd there you have it – the 100% true story of how Google came to be.\n\nHey Bard, write me an outro for an awesome email newsletter about the invention of Goog–\n\nOops, wrong browser.\n\nStay Cute,\nHenry & Dylan 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nP.P.S Click below to watch the Google video 👇\n\nWATCH GOOGLE\n\n‍\n\nMORE POSTS FOR YOU ❤️\nWhy Is Caviar So Expensive? 🪺\nHow Does a Vacuum Work? 💨\nWhat’s Inside a Beehive? 🐝\nSee all posts ->\nGet smart about nonsense🌈\n\nJoin 30,000+ subscribers and get our daily comic explaining nerdy stuff like you’re 5.\n\nPowered by\nDemandFlow"

Yet pros hit the ball in play on ~50% of swings – and make contact 80% of the time.\n\nSo what’s their secret?\n\nWell let’s set the scene…\n\nIt’s the top of the 7th inning. You’re at the plate facing down Hall of Fame legend Randy “The Big Unit” Johnson.\n\nYa, that’s a 6’10” mullet with an arm cannon.\n\nBut as if that isn’t intimidating enough, you also got grade A hecklers behind you.\n\nYou’re rattled.\n\nBut buckle up – your problems are about to get even worse because…\n\nHere’s how the math breaks down.\n\nRandy’s 60 feet 6 inches away.\n\nOr 55 feet when he strides off the rubber.\n\nSo a chill 95 mph fastball will leave you with only 0.4 seconds before it hits the catcher’s mitt – that’s 400 milliseconds.\n\nNot good.\n\nThat leaves us no time to react because:\n\nYour brain takes 100 milliseconds to process the image – aka you’re living in the past.\nYour nerves take 25 milliseconds to send the swing signal.\nYour body takes 150 milliseconds to actually swing.\n\nTLDR: You have ~0.1 seconds to swing or not – that little green line.\n\nHow fast is that?\n\nBlink.\n\nToo slow. That was 0.3 seconds…\n\nOh and you have the tiniest swing window to hit the ball – just 0.007 seconds.\n\nOtherwise you’ll hit a foul ball at best.\n\nSo what’s the pros secret, dammit?\n\nThe average Major League Baseball player’s vision is 20/12.\n\n(20/8 is the theoretical limit of human vision – which 2% of MLB players have.)\n\nWhat’s this mean?\n\nThe pitcher looks super close to them.\n\nHere’s how our eyes stack up:\n\nYou\nBarry Bonds\nBald Eagle\n\nOr for a mole, it looks 1,800 feet away.\n\nThat’s why moles don’t play baseball.\n\nBut humans do – because pros basically wear 2x binoculars.\n\nWhich lets them see the exact release angle and ball spin as it leaves the pitcher’s hand – revealing the type of pitch.\n\nThen they just predict the ball trajectory and BANG — they hit bombs.\n\nNot bad for chimp brains #SportScience\n\nCrush Ass,\nDylan & Henry 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nP.P.S Still here??

He’s responsible for testing and repairing arcade games.\n\nWhen Jobs was lucky, he got to work on the design of new Atari games.\n\nOne of his most notable contributions was the creation of the game Breakout – a single-player version of Pong:\n\nBut hang on, Steve! You didn’t design that whole game yourself..\n\n\nNo you didn’t.\n\n\nYour friend Steve Wozniak helped you, didn’t he?\n\nThank you for being honest.\n\nSteve and Steve were buds from high school. The two would geek out about the newest electronics and computer parts together.\n\nAnd Wozniak helped Jobs design the circuit board for Breakout.\n\nThen one day Wozniak showed up to Jobs with this new thing he had been working on:\n\nNow that hunk of parts probably doesn’t look like much to you.\n\nBut in 1975, this is what most computers looked like:\n\nThey sucked because they were insanely expensive and insanely huge.\n\nHere’s that giant IBM System/360 next to Wozniak’s creation:\n\nBig. Small.\n\nWozniak had done something incredible.\n\nHe created a cheap, powerful, portable personal computer.\n\nSo the two start a computer business together: Apple Computer Co.\n\n(Yes with Ronald, but let’s just ignore Ronald. I’ve already spent too much time in that rabbit hole.)\n\nThe only problem?\n\nThese clowns have no money to start their personal computer revolution.\n\nSo Steve Jobs sells his VW van for $800.\n\nAnd Steve Wozniak sells his fancy pants HP-65 calculator for $500.\n\nThey get their first 50 computer order from their local computer shop in Mountain View, California.\n\nAnd start assembling these Wozniak personal computer creations in Jobs’ family garage.\n\nAs for Ronald?\n\nWell that’s a separate story we’re gonna have to dig into another time.\n\nFor now, just be happy you learned how you, too, can take $1,300, create a personal computer revolution, and turn it into a 164,000 person company worth 3 TRILLION dollars.\n\nActually..\n\nNo, you’re screwed.\n\nStay Cute,\nHenry & Dylan 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nP.P.SClick below to watch the Apple video 👇\n\nWATCH APPLE\n\n‍\n\nMORE POSTS FOR YOU ❤️\nWhy Is Caviar So Expensive? 🪺\nHow Does a Vacuum Work? 💨\nWhat’s Inside a Beehive? 🐝\nSee all posts ->\nGet smart about nonsense🌈\n\nJoin 30,000+ subscribers and get our daily comic explaining nerdy stuff like you’re 5.\n\nPowered by\nDemandFlow"

This Mike:\n\nCloser…\n\nYes! Michael Jordan.\n\nWhat’s not to wanna be like?\n\nMost NBA championships won by any player\nMost MVP awards won by any player\nBillionaire\n\nNow – I won’t speak for you – but 2 out of those 3 things I can’t become no matter how hard I try. I’m 5’9”, 20% body fat, and play the piano.\n\nBut the last thing! I'm only $1,000,015,518 away.\n\nSo how does Michael Jordan become the first billionaire athlete?\n\nIt starts in 1984, when Michael Jordan gets drafted #1–\n\nOops, sorry. Hakeem Olajuwon was drafted first overall that year.\n\nThen Michae–\n\nJesus. Okay, then Michael Jordan?\n\nIf it were the olympics, that would have looked something like this:\n\nBummer.\n\nExcept it was only a bummer for the Houston Rockets and Portland Trail Blazers. Jordan goes total GOAT status that year winning ‘Rookie of the Year.’\n\nWhoops.\n\nThen he spends the next 13 seasons with the Bulls, winning 6 championships and the MVP all 6 times. Oh and one of those championships games he scored 38 points – with the flu and a 103℉ fever.\n\nSuck it, soccer sissies.\n\nOkay, so his money..\n\nIn those 13 seasons he spent with the Bulls, he only made $90 MILLION dollars in salary.\n\nBut when you’re #1 in the world and winning championships with influenza, you’re bound to get offers for a sponsorship deal…or 3..\n\nJordan famously had offers from Adidas, Nike, and Converse but didn’t know which to take. So he turned to his Mom:\n\nNo.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd the deal was done.\n\n$500,000/yr for 5 years so long as Jordan endorsed Nike shoes.\n\nPLUS Nike would make that endorsement easy by giving Jordan his own shoe line and 5% of sales. That’s how we got these beauties:\n\nWith Nike now controlling 90% of the basketball shoe market, this deal still makes Michael Jordan hundreds of millions of dollars per year.\n\n‘But Smart Nonsense, surely hundreds of millions of dollars does not equal a billion dollars’\n\nGonna use my full name, huh. Yes. Fine.\n\nWell I’m no Wall Street quant, but Mike’s portfolio looks something like this:\n\nNotice how almost all of his wealth came from things outside his NBA salary.\n\nThat’s GOAT status.\n\nNow I’ll brb.

I mean look at this graph of who you spend time with:\n\nBad at math?\n\nLemme break it down for you.\n\nAfter age 25, your friends and family don’t matter – sorry, Mom.\n\nThe only people that matter are your:\n\nCoworkers\nPartner\n\nBecause you spend:\n\n65,000 HOURS TOGETHER.\n\nSo locking down the right ~one~ is priority #1.\n\nBut the stats are brutal…nearly 50% of American marriages end in divorce.\n\nTranslation: We suck at marrying.\n\nThat’s because we think marriage is about the highs.\n\nThe honeymoon in the Maldives.\nThe safari in the Serengeti.\nThe cruise in the Galápagos.\n\nNope.\n\nMarriage is the 7,682nd dinner in your kitchen.\n\nYa, marriage isn’t about the highs – it’s about the lows.\n\nThe 20,000 mundane Monday meals just like this.\n\nSo now you’re at a pivotal point.\n\nYour future could like like either of these:\n\nSo basically:\n\nHeaven – you live a magical life together for 60 years\nHell – you end up sad, old, and fat…and poor if you’re extra lucky ;)\n\nOh, and I forgot…\n\nThis also affects the future of your kids – and all their future offspring.\n\nSo how do we get it right?\n\nNo.\n\nJenny’s an idiot – don’t do that.\n\nSee if you’re trying to marry the ONE, it’s probably not the first one.\n\nBut then which one is it?\n\nEnter Merrill Flood.\n\nWTF, why’d you put him upside down?\n\nThx.\n\nMerrill is a mathematical horndog from 1949 who solved this puzzle – called the Fiancée Problem.\n\n(He also created the Prisoner’s Dilemma – he’s a Smart Nonsense Hall of Famer)\n\nNow, the Fiancée Problem is simple.\n\nLet’s say you might date 100 people.\n\nFuck boi Brad.\n\nNerdy Ned.\n\nJock Jeff.\n\nStoner Steve.\n\n…and 96 more\n\nBut after you reject one, you can’t go back.\n\nSo when do you say “YES” and stop looking?\n\nWell, first you need a sample to know what’s out there.\n\nBut how big of a sample?\n\nMeaning if you’d date 100 guys, you won’t marry any of the first 37.\n\nThat’s your hot girl summer phase.\n\nThen you take the best relationship you had and marry him.\n\nJust kidding.\n\nYou can’t marry Ned.\n\nYou marry the NEXT guy as good or better than him.\n\nThis gives you the best mathematical chance of marrying the best person out of the 100.\n\n(FYI ironically there’s only a 37% chance they’re the absolute best person – aka THE one. But that’s still better than any other method.)\n\nNow, you might have 2 questions:\n\n1.Question 1: So everyone in the first 37% is just a….guinea pig? YES. You’re young though, so f*ck it.\n\n2.Question 2: Okay, psychopath. So what do I do now?\n\nWell, here’s the problem.\n\nIn terms of people you’d date in your life, you don’t know the exact NUMBER.\n\nBut what do you know?\n\nTIME.\n\nAka the time you wanna be on the dating market.\n\nOkay, so let’s apply the 37%.\n\nIf you’re dating since 18, 37% means sampling until 23, then marry the next best suitor.\n\nIf you’re a guy, you’re usually cool waiting until like 40, so you can be a fuckboi until 26.\n\nNow, marry responsibly ;)\n\nCrush Ass,\nDylan & Henry 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nP.P.S Still here??

So the poors are stuck outside…tanning.\n\nBut in America, the poors found them in the office. So now the rich run outside…tanning.\n\nGraphically, it’s the midwit meme.\n\nFascinating.\n\n(Side note: It’s also why rich people dress like hobos – ripped jeans, faded sweaters, and $1,850 trashed sneakers.)\n\n(Side note: It’s also why rich people dress like hobos – ripped jeans, faded sweaters, and $1,850 trashed sneakers.)\n\nBut my point is…we have a mixed relationship with the sun ☀️\n\nWe like it, but not too much.\n\nFor example, let’s say you’re at the beach.\n\nGirls are nice.\n\nBut the sun is mean.\n\nBecause after a while, it sizzles your skin — so you look for protection.\n\n(PSA: you only need 15 minutes of sun to tan — after that you’re just burning.)\n\nNow historically, you had a few options:\n\nEgyptians used beeswax\nGreeks used olive oil\nRomans used mud\n\nBut everything changes in 1938 with this one dude in Austria:\n\nNein!\n\nIt’s Franz Greiter:\n\nFranz is sad.\n\nNot because no pictures of him exist – but because while climbing Mount Piz Buin (lol what a name) he got sunburnt to a crisp.\n\nNow most of us would just take the L, but Franz is a ~nerd~\n\nSo he does science 🌈\n\nAnd invents…\n\nYa, he invents sunscreen — which he names after Piss Bun mountain or whatever.\n\nBut there’s only 1 problem…\n\nBasically, how much sun is screened?\n\nSo he creates a metric: Sun Protection Factor (SPF).\n\nHow’s it work?\n\nWell, lemme nerd out quick.\n\nSo, the sun shoots out all types of light:\n\nGamma\nX-ray\nUltraviolet\nVisible\nInfrared\nMicrowave\nRadio wave\n\nHell, just look at this drawing:\n\nNow half this light is friendly.\n\nThe other half wants to kill us.\n\nYa, the ouch light is on the left.\n\nSee its wavelength?\n\nSMALL. FAST.\n\nBasically, it’s the world’s smallest jackhammer.\n\nSo small in fact, that it can break your DNA – which kills your cells and gives you cancer.\n\nBut luckily, Earth got your back.\n\nBecause it has its own sunscreen – THE ATMOSPHERE.\n\nSee the atmosphere blocks most ouch light from reaching us.\n\nBut some still slips through…ultraviolet B & A.\n\nWhich UV hurts more — B or A?\n\nB.\n\nThat’s because the UVB model jackhammer is even smaller & faster — causing sunburns and ~cancer~\n\nBut UVA still hurts too.\n\nIt goes deeper into your skin – causing wrinkles and aging.\n\nBut here’s the catch with sunscreen SPF…\n\nSPF only says how much UVB the sunscreen blocks – it says nada about UVA.\n\nWrong.\n\nThat’s catch #2.\n\nSunscreen SPF isn’t linear — it’s logarithmic.\n\nMeaninghigh SPF doesn’t matter.\n\nFor example:\n\nSPF 15 = 94% protection\nSPF 30 = 97% protection\nSPF 100 = 99% protection\n\nTLDR: Buy SPF 30 – anything above that is useless.\n\nCrush ass,\n\nDylan & Henry\n\nP.S. if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nP.P.S.

Light pollution.\n\nGo into the woods…the deep woods.\n\nSee that?\n\nThat’s a crap load of stars.\n\nHow many do you think?\n\nNo. Gen Z is tapped.\n\nIt’s 2,500.\n\nOn the clearest night sky, you can see 2,500 stars.\n\nBut here’s the thing.\n\nThese stars are just in our Milky Way…this tiny bit of the Milky Way.\n\nThe Milk Way has 250 billion stars.\n\nBut we’re just 1 galaxy.\n\nGuess how many galaxies there are.\n\nTAPPED.\n\nThe answer is 250 billion – meaning there are as many galaxies in the universe as stars in our galaxy.\n\nLemme repeat that.\n\nTHERE ARE AS MANY GALAXIES IN THE UNIVERSE AS STARS IN OUR GALAXY.\n\nStill didn’t sink in?\n\nThink of it this way.\n\nPick up a grain of sand.\n\nFor every grain of sand on Earth, there are 10,000 stars.\n\nGet it?\n\nBut it gets crazier.\n\n1% of these stars have planets like Earth.\n\nSo 1 grain of sand = 100 Earths.\n\nHow’s that make you feel?\n\nGnarly huh?\n\nWell, buckle up…it gets gnarlier.\n\nBecause the Earth is a young planet – only 4.5 billion years young.\n\nBut most planets are old…\n\nLike 8 billion years old.\n\nMeaning they have a 3.5 billion year head start.\n\nCan you imagine Earth in 100 years? 1,000 years? 1 million?\n\nNow try 3.5 billion years…\n\nMind. Blown.\n\nHowever that future looks, one thing is certain: we’re traveling all over space.\n\nHow?\n\n~Energy~\n\nSee there are 3 levels of energy available:\n\nEarth\nSun\nGalaxy\n\n(Don’t worry, I’ll get to the paradox soon.)\n\nRight now, we’re on level #1 – close to using all the energy from our Earth.\n\nThe next level is using all the energy from our Sun – with something like a Dyson Sphere.\n\nThen we’d use the Sun’s energy to send 2 human fleets to other stars – where we’d repeat the process.\n\nIf each replication took 500 years, we’d conquer a galaxy in ~3.5 million years.\n\n3.5 million years = 1 galaxy.\n\nBut remember…\n\nThe average planet is 3.5billion years older than Earth….that’s 1,000 times longer than the 3.5 million years needed for 1 galaxy.\n\nTranslation: Aliens should be all over the universe.\n\nSo this begs the question:\n\nGreat question.\n\nMaybe there’s hope for Gen Z.\n\nBecause you just discovered the…\n\nBadass, right?\n\nThe Fermi Paradox asks, “Where the hell are the aliens?”\n\nThere are 2 answers to Fermi:\n\nWe’re alone\nWe’re not alone\n\nLet’s explore each.\n\n1. We’re alone\n\nWe’re alone = no aliens.\n\nWhy are there no aliens?\n\nBasically, there’s no life ‘cause something stops it….a Great Filter.\n\nBut the big question is: where’s the filter?\n\nBefore us?\n\nOr after us?\n\nThe answer is critical.\n\nBefore us = HOORAY 🥳\n\nBecause that means life is rare.\n\nAka every other life form never made it to our level. Our Earth had some special event that other Earth-like planets never had.\n\nTop contenders are events that took a while — like billions of years.\n\nHere are the top 2:\n\n1. Life itself – Unclear how this happened but some think lightning zapped a molecular soup, creating life’s building blocks — like amino acids and nucleotides — which formed a cell that could self-replicate. This took 1 billion years.\n\n2. Prokaryote to Eukaryote – One old bacteria ate another and told it to be the brain (nucleus). This took 2 billion years.\n\nSome say the jump from semi-smart (monkey) to smart (human) is another leap – but it’s less convincing.\n\nRegardless, this means you better hope we don’t find life on Mars.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause if lame ass Mars can make life — especially complex life — we’re definitely not rare. So that’d mean the great filter is…\n\nAFTER US!\n\n[Cue: Villain laughing. Woman shrieking. Baby crying.]\n\nAfter us = DEATH 💀\n\nBasically it means something in the future kills us — probably just ourselves with nukes, climate change, or AI.\n\nRead Elon’s Solution\n\nThanks, Elon.\n\nBut for now, let’s explore option 2:\n\n2. We’re not alone\n\nNot alone = aliens exist (but we can’t see ‘em).\n\nWhy not?\n\nThere are a bunch of reasons.\n\nHere are 5:\n\nWe’re rural – We live in a remote part of the universe – like Eskimos in northern Canada when Columbus landed in America.\nWe’re a zoo – Aliens observe us but don’t mess with us. They probably just giggle watching us read emails and throw poo at each other.\nWe’re useless – We’re like an anthill. Aliens are like Columbus. Would Columbus care about an anthill…or just ignore it, find gold, and diddle natives?\nWe’re dumb – Our technology is too primitive to understand alien signals. Or we just don’t understand reality because reality ain’t real mannnnnnn.\nPhysical world’s dumb – The universe is cold, dark, and lonely. Screw that. Aliens uploaded their brains to a virtual heaven with infinite virgins.\n\nOkay…\n\nSo what do you do with this?\n\nHug me ❤️\n\nFirst, because physical touch is my love language.\n\nBut second, because we’re either:\n\nStranded on a tiny rock in vast darkness\nSurrounded by aliens\n\nI’m hoping for #2\n\nCrush Alien Ass,\nDylan & Henry 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nP.P.S Still here?

Heinous. Even downright abominable.\n\nBut it wasn’t always this way.\n\nSee in 753 BC this strange habit started to appear when a she-wolf – yes a she-wolf – found two abandoned infants on the bank of the Tiber River.\n\nTheir names were Romulus and Remus. Twins of a Vestal Virgin and Mars, the god of war.\n\nDon’t ask me what a Vestal Virgin is.\n\nOr what she was doing with a God for that matter…\n\nIt sounds not right.\n\nSo anyway, the twins are left out to die on the river.\n\nAnd thankfully our she-wolf suckled them back to health.\n\nNow as Romulus and Remus grew older, they became warriors and overthrew some important people.\n\nThis granted them the right to found a new city on the banks of their sacred birthplace – the Tiber River.\n\nBut, remember, they’re twins.\n\nSo they bickered a lot.\n\nAbout stuff like which of the two river hills they’d build their city on.\n\nRomulus voted for the hill on the left — The Palatine Hill.\n\nRemus voted for the hill on the right — The Aventine Hill.\n\nIt was a tie. And every tie needs a tie-breaker.\n\nLuckily Romulus and Remus had the ability to consult the Gods on the matter.\n\nAnd they decided that the Gods would speak through the flight of birds.\n\nLol.\n\nYep, Romulus saw 12 birds on his hill.\n\nRemus, only six.\n\nWomp womp wommmpppp.\n\nYep, Romulus chopped Remus’ head off because he jumped over his wall.\n\nAnd without a twin brother he could now be the sole ruler of his new walled city – Rome.\n\nOkay, that was just me indulging in the silly story of how Rome came to be.\n\nBut around the same time something curious starts happening in town.\n\nLook:\n\nThe snack-of-choice at the time – the hard wafer – was simply too hard.\n\nSo Romulus gets a little smarter:\n\nDipping a hard wafer in wine made them palatable!\n\nAnd this tradition endured for millennia.\n\nThen dunking-hard-things-in-liquid made its way to the home of the free and the land of the brave – America.\n\nAnd we Americans – with our acquired taste for trans fats – started to notice something magical that happened when you dunked a chocolate chip cookie in fatty milk:\n\nThe fat in milk helps dissolve flavor molecules.\nThen – because it’s a liquid – it acts as a delivery vehicle to spread those molecules all over your taste buds.\nNow you have deep, rich, chocolate-chip-cookie-milk-mix sloshing around your mouth. It’s an intense, flavorful symphony!\n\nAnd, I bet you want some cookies and milk now 😉.\n\nSo while you go digging in the pantry for those Chips Ahoy (are you team crunchy or chewy?), make sure you thank the Romans and that bizarre she-wolf that started a cookie-dipping empire.\n\nStay Cute,\nHenry & Dylan 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nP.P.S Click below to watch another founder’s video 👇\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\n‍\n\nMORE POSTS FOR YOU ❤️\nWhy Is Caviar So Expensive? 🪺\nHow Does a Vacuum Work? 💨\nWhat’s Inside a Beehive? 🐝\nSee all posts ->\nGet smart about nonsense🌈\n\nJoin 30,000+ subscribers and get our daily comic explaining nerdy stuff like you’re 5.\n\nPowered by\nDemandFlow"

Screw it.\n\nI’m trying to teach a lesson, pop the hood.\n\nA gas engine – aka an internal combustion engine – has to do an extraordinary amount of work to get a car moving.\n\nIn fact, the MOST efficient gas engines are only 40% good at their job.\n\nThat means for every 100 units of energy shot into the engine, 40 units are converted to power, and 60 units are lost to heat.\n\nNot good, but that’s a different story.\n\nHere’s how they work though:\n\nYou press the gas pedal.\n\nThe throttle valve opens to let air in.\n\nA fuel injector sprays fuel into that air.\n\nSpark plugs ignite that fuel-air mixture.\n\nAn explosion occurs (ahem, internal COMBUSTION engine), that pushes a piston, to turn a crankshaft, which rotates a camshaft, to open and close more valves, that let in more air and fuel, to move more pistons, which gets the crankshaft going faster, to turn the transmission, which connects to the axles, and turns the wheels.\n\nSimple, really.\n\nAnd remember, 60% of energy is just lost to heat in that process.\n\nIt’s an okay but incredibly inefficient way to make a car move.\n\nSo what did Tesla do?\n\nWhy are you asking me?\n\nHuh?\n\nEliminate everything?\n\nRight, the minimum viable car:\n\nBattery - power bank\nMotor - power to motion machine\nWheels - circles that move smoothly\n\nInstant torque?\n\nWoah, watch it with the coup!\n\nIt turns out that the gas engine bs we did above is all to create a twisting force that moves the wheels – torque.\n\nAs you could probably tell from all its moving parts, it takes a really long time to get torque out of a gas engine into the wheels.\n\nThere’s just so many moving parts that need to wake up when you press the gas pedal.\n\nBut as Elon said, an electric car is just batteries, motor, and wheels.\n\nWhen you hit the gas pedal, you get near-instant torque!\n\nPower to wheels.\n\nNow excuse me while I–\n\nStay Cute,\nHenry & Dylan 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nP.P.S Click below to watch another vehicle video 👇\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\n‍\n\nMORE POSTS FOR YOU ❤️\nWhy Is Caviar So Expensive? 🪺\nHow Does a Vacuum Work? 💨\nWhat’s Inside a Beehive? 🐝\nSee all posts ->\nGet smart about nonsense🌈\n\nJoin 30,000+ subscribers and get our daily comic explaining nerdy stuff like you’re 5.\n\nPowered by\nDemandFlow"

Not the site owner.\n\nAnd Steve realized this was a game changer for the ~world wide web~.\n\nThat was the first YouTube idea – post videos to get hot dates.\n\nThink I’m kidding?\n\nTheir slogan?\n\nTune In, Hook Up.\n\nLolol.\n\nTwo problems though:\n\nNobody uploaded videos of themselves. It was too awkward.\nThere literally wasn’t enough bandwidth on the internet to play videos.\n\nSo the boys head back to the drawing board.\n\nProblem #1 was f*cked.\n\nBut problem #2 had a lucky break.\n\nRemember pesky pop-ups like this?\n\nWell it turns out Flash Player made video on the internet go around.\n\nAnd Adobe had just released Flash Player 8 – a free plugin that would shrink videos down to playable size on the internet.\n\nSo Jawed – with Flash Player 8 and a camera in hand – heads to the zoo.\n\nJawed changed the game.\n\nHe showed the internet that YouTube could be a place where you posted miscellaneous personal content, not dating material.\n\nAnd everyone followed.\n\nStay Cute,\nHenry & Dylan 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nP.P.S Click below to watch another crazy invention video 👇\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\n‍\n\nMORE POSTS FOR YOU ❤️\nWhy Is Caviar So Expensive? 🪺\nHow Does a Vacuum Work? 💨\nWhat’s Inside a Beehive? 🐝\nSee all posts ->\nGet smart about nonsense🌈\n\nJoin 30,000+ subscribers and get our daily comic explaining nerdy stuff like you’re 5.\n\nPowered by\nDemandFlow"

But the ocean is water – hence no clouds.\n\nBut what does the ocean have?\n\nSalt.\n\nIf you spray saltwater ~10 feet into the air, it naturally carries upward, and water vapor sticks to the salt particles.\n\nSo for only a few billion bucks, we could have a fleet of robot boats churning clouds into the air.\n\nGlobal warming solved.\n\nCrush Ass,\nDylan & Henry 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nP.P.S Still here??

The cake is made with the finest dark cocoa powder, and it is so moist and fluffy, it will melt in your mouth. The frosting is made with real Belgian chocolate, and it is so thick and creamy, it will make you want to lick the plate. And the ganache drizzle is the perfect finishing touch, adding a touch of sweetness and richness. This cake is so good, it will make you want to eat the whole thing in one sitting. But be warned, this cake is not for the faint of heart. It is pure chocolate indulgence, and it will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth.\n\nSorry that was ChatGPT.\n\nBut wow. sex.\n\nSo you each have a slice.\n\n\nIt’s a fatty flavor bomb in your mouth.\n\nOh my gosh.\n\nThe cake, it’s…it’s–\n\n–It’s making your whole body feel things you didn’t know you could feel.\n\nThings like being hit by a truck full of rainbows.\n\nYou and your partner sprint to the bedroom.\n\nThis experience calls for one thing and one thing only: hanky-panky.\n\nThe half eaten cake?\n\nWell she’s all on her lonesome. Naked & afraid on the kitchen counter.\n\nWhat’s that over there?\n\nOh no.\n\nIt’s your pug: Counter-Surfing-Cooper\n\nHe smells that sweet ChatGPT Belgian chocolate. Blood in the water.\n\nPaws up, ass down — surfs up, Coop.\n\nIn practically one inhale the chocolate cake vanishes.\n\nStraight down Cooper’s gullet.\n\nYou come downstairs butt naked to find…\n\nYa Cooper’s dead.\n\nHe ate a ton of chocolate cake.\n\nRIP 🙏\n\nBut what gives? Why can’t dogs eat chocolate?\n\nWell let’s learn a little chemistry together.\n\nChocolate contains 2 compounds that we humans love, but your dog can’t digest.\n\nTheobormine [thee-oh-broh-mine] – the thing that gives chocolate its delicious bitter taste.\nCaffeine – the thing that apparently all of society agrees is okay to consume together even though we’re all just hopped up on Speed going about our days interacting with each other on…ya know…drugs.\n\nBoth of these things are stimulants.\n\nAnd stimulants are a molecule that increases activity in your central nervous system – the body’s command center.\n\nImagine a mission control that takes in information from the world, then moves your muscles, which tells your heart how fast to beat and your lungs how much to breathe.\n\nStimulants cause all of that stuff to go faster.\n\nStimulants are technically toxic.\n\nSo when you ingest stimulants, your liver wants to unleash enzymes to break them down.\n\nIf it didn’t, the stimulant would stay in your body for a long time and cause all kinds of crazy runaway problems (hint hint..).\n\nOkay.\n\nIn the case of theobromine and caffeine, here’s what happens:\n\nYou eat a piece of chocolate cake.\n\nTheobromine and caffeine go from your stomach to your bloodstream.\n\nOnce in your blood, your brain slurps the stims up.\n\nSh*t goes haywire.\n\nThe Theobromine and caffeine in your blood end up at your body’s last line of defense: The Liver Castle.\n\nYour liver unleashes its archers – an enzyme called CYP1A2.\n\nCYP1A2 gets into a battle with the stimulants, neutralizes them, and puts them in body bags to ship off to your kidney.\n\nYou pee ‘em out.\n\nSo what’s the problem?\n\nWell dogs don’t come with much CYP1A2 in their bodies. Especially small dogs (that’s why poison control will ask for your dog’s weight when you call in emergency).\n\nJust look how much CYP1A2 I have compared to a chihuahua:\n\nSo when a dog eats chocolate, the theobromine and caffeine stimulant can just run away in their bodies.\n\nThere’s no liver troops to fight it.\n\nAnd what happens when stimulants run away in a dog’s body you ask?\n\nUncontrolled vomiting, seizures, and death.\n\nCut it with the urgent hanky-panky, and put your chocolate cake in the fridge.\n\nStay Cute,\nHenry & Dylan 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.‍\n\nP.P.S Click below to watch the chocolate video 👇\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\n‍\n\nMORE POSTS FOR YOU ❤️\nWhy Is Caviar So Expensive? 🪺\nHow Does a Vacuum Work? 💨\nWhat’s Inside a Beehive? 🐝\nSee all posts ->\nGet smart about nonsense🌈\n\nJoin 30,000+ subscribers and get our daily comic explaining nerdy stuff like you’re 5.\n\nPowered by\nDemandFlow"

Great idea, your majesty.\n\n(Great = great at destroying a country. England’s illegal import of opium led to 2 wars and 20% of the Chinese zooted in opium dens like this👇)\n\nSo…let’s trade opium ;)\n\nBut we don’t have any.\n\nSo let’s pick some up here:\n\nIndia.\n\nThat’s where they grow, boil, and dry poppy into our addictive sticky resin.\n\nBasically it’s just this:\n\nAwesome.\n\nNow let’s plan out our route.\n\nTake out your crayons.\n\nHow do you get from point A to point B?\n\nNo, Vicky.\n\nThat’s the Silk Road.\n\nLand is expensive – because you use freakin’ camels. Plus each country charges you troll tolls. So we limit land to luxury goods.\n\nWater is cheap – you can ship tons of big, heavy cargo.\n\nSo wanna try again?\n\nGood.\n\nNow how about B to C?\n\nPerfect!\n\nYou just designed your first trade route :)\n\nNow let’s zoom in on B to C.\n\nNow as you’re traveling through, you’ll wanna make a pitstop.\n\nHere are your options:\n\nSo just stop at any random port?\n\nNo.\n\nBatavia (aka Jakarta, Indonesia today) is annoyingly far.\n\nSo maybe Malacca or Penang?\n\nBut see, ports wanna make a buck – so they charge a fee.\n\nFor example, Malacca charges you 15% of all your goods to stay – regardless of if you’re even selling them there. Meaning if you have $10,000 of opium, they charge you $1,500.\n\nFuck that.\n\nSo you get fed up and open your own EIC port.\n\nWhere?\n\nSINGAPORE.\n\nBut you don’t wanna be the only one using the port.\n\nSo you give a killer offer to other boats:\n\nSingapore was a FREE PORT – meaning no troll tolls & taxes on businesses.\n\nSuddenly 80% of boats stop in Singapore.\n\nWhich becomes a BIG deal in 1869.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause a crazy shortcut opens:\n\nTHE SUEZ CANAL.\n\nNow your trade route looks like this:\n\nIt’s super fast.\n\nYou save 4,500 miles and 3 months of travel.\n\nOr 30% off your journey…and tea.\n\nAnd people love a deal.\n\nSo overnight, trade between Europe and Asia skyrockets 500%.\n\nWhich means for 100+ years, Singapore makes BANK.\n\nBut then, something happens.\n\nThe Japanese.\n\nSee in WWII, the Japanese are on a sneak attack spree.\n\nBut wait…that’s Peal Harbor.\n\nTheir sneak attack in Singapore looks like this:\n\nSeriously.\n\nInstead of 330mph Mitsubishi Zero fighter planes, they have…bikes.\n\n23,000 bikes.\n\nWhich scared the shit out of the Brits – so for 3 years, the Japanese occupy Singapore.\n\nAnd they trash it.\n\nSo Singapore is screwed:\n\nPoor – 70% of the country lives in shacks with no plumbing\nResourceless – No natural resources like oil, metal, or even water\nSmall – It’s an island the size of NYC\n\nBut then its friendly neighbors come to help.\n\nYa, they give Singapore the boot.\n\nBecause it's 60% Chinese – and Malaysians just want Malays.\n\nNow Singapore’s screwed…again.\n\nBut one man comes to save the day – Lee Kuan Yew.\n\nPrime Minister Yew had enough of this shit.\n\nHe makes himself DICTATOR…but a good one.\n\nHe basically treats Singapore like a giant company.\n\nKinda like if Elon Musk and Kim Jong-un had a baby.\n\nNow Singapore has no natural resources. But what does it have?\n\nPEOPLE.\n\nThey’re the most valuable resource.\n\nSo he invests in 3 areas:\n\nHomes\nHospitals\nSchools\n\nThis makes for a safe, healthy, and smart workforce.\n\nBut its still not enough to draw in foreign investment.\n\nSo he returns to Singapore’s roots…\n\nYes, no troll toll – aka LOW TAXES.\n\nSo Singapore goes hyper capitalistic. Right when China does the opposite…COMMIES!\n\nPlus Lee ends corruption.\n\nHow?\n\nHe pays government officials fat stacks – so there’s little incentive to be naughty.\n\nJust look at their politician pay today:\n\nFAT. STACKS.\n\nWhich attracts good politicians – who run their state-owned companies (e.g. airlines, steel, and chemicals) like good businesses.\n\nGood = profitable.\n\nNow Singapore is a financial superpower.\n\nJust peep their GDP per capita:\n\nSingapore – $81k\nUnited States – $72k\nEngland – $46k\nChina – $16k\n\n(Qatar is #1 with $128k – but they cheat because oil is $110k of this.)\n\nToday, Singapore looks like this:\n\nOr with sexy models:\n\nSometimes dictatorships are good, I guess.\n\nCrush Ass,\nDylan & Henry 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nP.P.S Still here??

He created the most destructive weapon on the planet.\n\nSo I spent the entire movie thinking about how I was going to tell you how a nuclear bomb works.\n\nBut before we do this, just remember: with great power comes great responsibility. I don’t want to see any nuclear bombs attributed to a Smart Nonsense email.\n\nThat would be silly.\n\nSo let’s take it back. 1898.\n\nMarie Curie and her husband are in their lab.\n\nYa, they’re just fingering Uranium like it’s no big deal.\n\nBecause, well, it wasn’t a big deal until they noticed something peculiar:\n\nTheir Uranium had some mysterious energy that randomly traveled through paper or metal and could expose a photographic plate.\n\nThey called this energy “radioactivity” – unstable atoms that decayed at random, unpredictable times.\n\nBut how was this radioactivity producing energy that developed a photographic plate?\n\nSo?\n\nOh, that’s what that famous equation does. Cool. Thanks Einstein.\n\nUnfortunately all that fingering of radioactive material catches up to Marie Curie.\n\nShe died.\n\nSo these two guys – Walton & Cockcroft – take over to see if they can control radioactive decay.\n\nIf they could, they’d unlock the energy Einstein was talking about.\n\nSo they get a GIANT electric field.\n\nAnd start blasting protons at lithium nuclei.\n\nThe lithium decays! It works!\n\nJust one subatomic problem..\n\nEven with their giant electric field, it doesn’t work that well.\n\nBecause protons are positively charged.\n\nAnd so is the nucleus of an atom.\n\nPositive to positive means they want to repel each other.\n\nIt takes an ENORMOUS amount of energy to overcome that repulsion.\n\nThis method for unleashing the power of radioactive decay could never work.\n\nIt required too much energy.\n\nBut in 1932 something amazing happens:\n\nSee that fellow particle enthusiast, James Chadwick?\n\nHe just discovered the neutron right in front of you.\n\nHow?\n\nWell look closely at his magnet.\n\nThose particles flying through his apparatus unimpeded by the magnetic field are neutrons – a neutral subatomic particle.\n\nA particle with no charge.\n\nSo unlike our positive atomic nucleus repelling positive protons, neutrons could slam into a nucleus.\n\nFor free.\n\nOkay, nuclear bomb time.\n\nPut your goggles on.\n\nNow with our neutral neutrons, we can bombard an unstable atom like Uranium-235.\n\nAnd when you do that, 2 more neutrons pop off in the reaction\n\nThose 2 neutrons require no extra energy to hit another nucleus.\n\n2 more neutrons pop off!\n\nThis 2-neutron-thing goes exponential.\n\nYou have a runaway chain reaction on your hands:\n\nAnd in 1kg of Uranium-235, there’s a trillion TRILLION atoms for this nuclear dance to occur.\n\nEach of those mini E=mc2 mass changes add up to a LOT of released energy when we’re talking about trillion trillions…\n\nWe’ve created a nuclear bomb.\n\nThis sheer power is what made Einstein and Oppenheimer so butt hurt about inventing the bomb in the first place.\n\nThe neutron genie was officially out of the bottle.\n\nStay Cute,\nHenry & Dylan 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nP.P.S If this wasn’t enough Smart Nonsense for one day, click to watch the daily Smart Nonsense podcast👇\n\nMORE POSTS FOR YOU ❤️\nWhy Is Caviar So Expensive? 🪺\nHow Does a Vacuum Work? 💨\nWhat’s Inside a Beehive? 🐝\nSee all posts ->\nGet smart about nonsense🌈\n\nJoin 30,000+ subscribers and get our daily comic explaining nerdy stuff like you’re 5.\n\nPowered by\nDemandFlow"

It doesn’t get rhythm, or pitch, or timbre.\n\nIt thinks in bips and bops – 1s and 0s.\n\nSo for a computer to try and identify Uptown Funk, it’d be like trying to find a needle in a haystack:\n\nWhere it can only find the needle by looking at a picture of the needle:\n\nThen comparing that picture to every. single. piece. of. hay. one. by. one.\n\nDid I mention the stack of hay is 230 MILLION songs deep?\n\nSo with this huge haystack comparison problem, the engineers at Shazam HQ got smart:\n\nWhen you press SHAZAM!, your phone microphone starts listening:\n\nThen Shazam produces a spectrogram of the soundwaves it receives.\n\nThat’s time on the x-axis.\n\nFrequency on the y-axis.\n\nAnd loudness on the z-axis. Or in this case the depth of color from black to yellow.\n\nWith this data, Shazam can distill any song into a fingerprint:\n\nA unique code that their servers can match much more quickly than comparing each song one by one.\n\nUptown funk gon' give it to ya!\n\nStay Cute,\nHenry & Dylan 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nP.P.S If this wasn’t enough Smart Nonsense for one day, click to watch the daily Smart Nonsense podcast👇\n\n‍\n\nMORE POSTS FOR YOU ❤️\nWhy Is Caviar So Expensive? 🪺\nHow Does a Vacuum Work? 💨\nWhat’s Inside a Beehive? 🐝\nSee all posts ->\nGet smart about nonsense🌈\n\nJoin 30,000+ subscribers and get our daily comic explaining nerdy stuff like you’re 5.\n\nPowered by\nDemandFlow"

It’s stupid expensive.\n\nSo a US Army General calls up the Natick Soldier Center for R&D\n\nSo Natick gets to work.\n\nThey use their emergency authorization funds to come up with this fake meat process called ‘meat restructuring.’\n\nMeat restructuring could save the US troops from starving to death.\n\nAnd it’s easy peasy: just take all the nastiest parts of a butcher’s scraps –\n\nSkin?\n\nYumyumyum.\n\nPure fat?\n\nMmmmm. Love fat.\n\nOrgans?\n\naaAHHHH YAAA!\n\nThrow em into a meat blender:\n\nBlend them into a batter:\n\nAdd salt and water – you know, so…the..uhh..proteins can bind back together into huge meat slab:\n\nAnd voila!\n\n“Meat” that can be re-structured into any shape and size.\n\nAnd all goes well in Vietnam! I think.\n\nSo now we’ve got a process for creating fake meat thanks to the US Army.\n\nWhich naturally begs the question: What’s actually in my Chicken McNuggets?\n\nGood. Good.\n\nSo lucky for us, McDonald’s Executive chef – René Arend – was asking the same thing.\n\nCause he had his own army of fatties he needed to feed cheaply – Americans:\n\nEven luckier for us he comes across this Vietnam Army thing – restructured meat.\n\nAnd in a once-in-a-lifetime-black-swan-jimjamboree, Arend realizes he can massively scale McDonald’s menu if he uses this cheap, new, fake, meat goo.\n\nSo he grinds up chicken meat, scraps, bones, you-name-it to come up with a chicken paste:\n\nAnd he adds the meat goo chicken paste to Chicken Nuggets!\n\nSo ya, childhood vindicated.\n\nStay Cute,\nHenry & Dylan 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nP.P.S Not enough Smart Nonsense for one day?

It gets WAY too hot.\n\nSo that’s where the cone comes in.\n\nBelow the ice cream mound are several vertical shafts that plunge up to 6 feet underground.\n\nSo throughout the day, adult ants ferry the babies up and down these shafts.\n\nDown to cool off during the day:\n\nUp to warm during the night:\n\nThey’re chasing the perfect temperature for the babies.\n\nOkay, but surely these massive ant colonies don’t exist for the sole purpose of raising babies, right?\n\nWell they kinda do lolol.\n\nAnts just sleep, eat, and do this baby temperature dance all day.\n\nOkay, what about eating then?\n\nWell the only other type of tunnel is a forager tunnel:\n\nThey’re horizontal passages buried just a few centimeters below the surface.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, scout ants use these passageways to look for food while staying underground for as long as possible.\n\nCause you know as soon as they come up to eat, they get…\n\nFried.\n\nStay Cute,\nHenry & Dylan 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nMORE POSTS FOR YOU ❤️\nWhy Is Caviar So Expensive? 🪺\nHow Does a Vacuum Work? 💨\nWhat’s Inside a Beehive? 🐝\nSee all posts ->\nGet smart about nonsense🌈\n\nJoin 30,000+ subscribers and get our daily comic explaining nerdy stuff like you’re 5.\n\nPowered by\nDemandFlow"

The top of your head:\n\nThen it’s just a really unfortunate race to the middle…\n\nF*ck.\n\nThey met up.\n\nThat happened really fast.\n\nWhy?\n\nBasically at the microscopic level, hair goes through specific growth phases:\n\nThe first phase is called anagen. 2-6 years of growth that takes a little hair seed and creates a thick hair.\n\nOnce the hair has matured, it moves into a short resting phase – telogen.\n\nThe blood supply is removed, the hair falls out, and the growth cycle begins again.\n\nBut this is where men have a problem.\n\nBecause they’ve got so much TESTOSTERONE, they’ve also invited in testosterone’s bigger, bolder cousin: Dihydrotestosterone (DHT).\n\nAnd DHT isn’t nice at all.\n\nDHT shortens that hair follicle growth phase.\n\nSo hairs that were once long and thick become shorter and thinner because they have less time to grow.\n\nThis sensitivity to DHT affects certain parts of the scalp more than others, which is why every dude ends up like this:\n\nThe cure?\n\nJust get some Rogaine.\n\nIt works for most men.\n\nStay Cute,\nHenry & Dylan 🌈\n\nP.S if you enjoyed this lesson, forward it to a friend.\n\nIf you’re that sexy friend, subscribe here.\n\nMORE POSTS FOR YOU ❤️\nWhy Is Caviar So Expensive? 🪺\nHow Does a Vacuum Work? 💨\nWhat’s Inside a Beehive? 🐝\nSee all posts ->\nGet smart about nonsense🌈\n\nJoin 30,000+ subscribers and get our daily comic explaining nerdy stuff like you’re 5.\n\nPowered by\nDemandFlow"
